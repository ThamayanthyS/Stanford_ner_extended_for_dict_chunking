FOOD	[ O  ]	Love this place

FOOD	[ O  ]	Yeah, thats right a five freakin star rating
FOOD	[ O  ]	Five Star Truck Stop Dining At Its Finest
FOOD	[ O  ]	Be prepared to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was first introduced to the Pine Cone at its Johnson Creek location years ago and freaked out at the size of the awesome, delicious desserts
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Then on a recent road trip someone mentioned about eating at the Pine Cone, I thought is there really more than one?  I looked out the window to see exactly where we were at and it wasn't near Johnson Creek -- when we arrived, and I saw the bakery
FOOD	[ O  ]	I knew I was home
FOOD	[ chicken, breast ]	It was near dinner time so I ordered stuffed chicken breast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The dinner roll alone is a meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I can't say enough about dinner

FOOD	[ O  ]	 You can tell its fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Its plentiful
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Its cheap
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You literally can stuff yourself for next to nothing
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can't possibly leave this place without indulging on some bakery goods to take home, IF they can make it home
FOOD	[ O  ]	 In our case, they were safely packed in the trunk for our safety and yours
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The last thing we need to explain to the police is we were under the influence of bakery goods from the Pine Cone
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ate a Saturday morning breakfast at the Pine Cone
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Friendly,quick service, normal prices
FOOD	[ new year ]	 But for the new year - the special was all-you-can-eat pancakes for $2

FOOD	[ eggs, sausage ]	 Father had the typical, two eggs, toast, hash-bowns (seem fresh cut), sausage links
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 Food was tasty, no major qualms other than - the hash-browns need a bit more cooking and the coffee needs a bit more bite
FOOD	[ cream, eclairs, blueberry, muffin ]	very nice assortment of bakes goods - massive - as large as your head cream-puffs, eclairs - I took a blueberry muffin to go - which I enjoyed
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quick exit from I-94
FOOD	[ O  ]	just northeast of  MadisonAttention fans of David Lynch
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Do stop by this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The atmosphere, staff and patrons will certainly help to make your visit enjoyable
FOOD	[ caramel ]	Last time I was here I ordered the caramel nut covered cinnamon roll
FOOD	[ butter ]	 The waitress asked if I wanted it warmed with some butter
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I thought that sounded even better and said to go ahead and do that
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She nodded agreement
FOOD	[ butter ]	 Then when she brought it to me it was unheated and no butter
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Odd but also kind of humorous
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I always enjoy being in a David Lynch film from time to time
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service and food is way better than the country restaurant just a mile south on 51
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Be sure to go here instead
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Their booths are made for skinny people from the 50s
FOOD	[ O  ]	  take a table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 start a conversations with the truck driver to your left
FOOD	[ O  ]	We used to go to the Pine Cone when it was across the street
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Must be hard times for these guys because the interior appears to be older than what they had when they were on the other side of the street
FOOD	[ O  ]	  That place now sits empty
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Why is this area depressed?   Don't ask me, I don't know
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Do I look like I have all the answers?
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food here is good and the prices are cheap
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Go here for a nice meal and a flash back to the past and don't forget to take home some bakery
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Or if you aren't hungry just stop by for some great baked goods
FOOD	[ O  ]	   Well worth the stop
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place gets four stars because of their five star bakery selection
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Crazy big cinnamon rolls and good prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	i rarely give five star reviews but for what this restaurant is, it's pretty perfect
FOOD	[ eggs, sourdough, bacon ]	 i've only eaten breakfast here (twice in the last three weeks) and the eggs are cooked perfectly, the sourdough toast is made in the kitchen and is delicious, and the bacon was perfectly crispy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 the hashbrowns are the best i've had in a long time - perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside
FOOD	[ O  ]	 the pancakes are huge and light and amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	 the cinnamon rolls taste just as good as they look
FOOD	[ O  ]	prices are right on, baked goods are pretty great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 service is fast and friendly - really fast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 i haven't had to wait more than 5 minutes to get my meal
FOOD	[ eggs, eggs ]	 i might be in the honeymoon phase, but perfectly cooked poached eggs or over easy eggs are hard to come by!  it shouldn't be an anomaly to discover well cooked food, but i suppose it is
FOOD	[ bread, breakfasts ]	 sure it's a "greasy spoon" but how many greasy spoons bake their own bread?  can't recommend this place enough for great breakfasts
FOOD	[ O  ]	With a recent addition of a truck driver for a BF I have found myself frequenting truck stops to dine
FOOD	[ O  ]	This little place is quite a pleasant surprise
FOOD	[ O  ]	Basically it is just great home cooking
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything is homemade and quite good
FOOD	[ O  ]	The baked goods in the front counter were amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	The size of the cinnamon rolls was insane
FOOD	[ pie ]	And of course I couldn't leave without a piece of pie
FOOD	[ breakfasts, beef ]	This is one of the best breakfasts I have had! Is the decor dated? Absolutely but it just adds to the nostalgic charm! The place just reeks of beef cooking
FOOD	[ pastry, breakfasts ]	Ahhh delicious! Check out the pastry cases!!!! OMG, is all I have to say!hands down one of the best breakfasts my wife and i have had
FOOD	[ O  ]	stopped in here based on the positive reviews from fellow yelpers and was sure glad i did
FOOD	[ O  ]	this is a good sized diner at a truck stop
FOOD	[ O  ]	the first thing that caught our eye was the pastries - they were all huge and all looked great
FOOD	[ O  ]	tip - be sure to save space for at least one
FOOD	[ french toast ]	i went with the cinnamon roll french toast and was very pleased
FOOD	[ sausage, patty ]	very large portion and great taste - go witht the sausage patty over the links
FOOD	[ O  ]	people behind us had links on their plate and they didnt look too appetzing
FOOD	[ patty ]	the patty was good
FOOD	[ chicken, steak, eggs ]	wife went with a chicken friend steak, eggs, and hashbrowns
FOOD	[ potatoes ]	hashbrowns left a bit to desire but they get bonus points for being real potatoes and fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	overall, great experience and we were in and out in 35 mins so we could continue out journey
FOOD	[ O  ]	looking forward to stopping here again sometime soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is definitely not your usual truck stop
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pastries look delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dinner rolls are large enough for a meal themselves and good!  We had a young waitress who I think was new
FOOD	[ O  ]	We found her to be sweet, polite and trying very hard
FOOD	[ O  ]	The lady managing the restaurant was really rude to her
FOOD	[ O  ]	We could all hear it
FOOD	[ O  ]	A delicious breakfast
FOOD	[ pastry ]	 Amazing fresh bakery and pastry items
FOOD	[ O  ]	 HOWEVER, the parkinglot/gas station area is filthy
FOOD	[ glass ]	 Strewn with debris, dead cars, broken glass
FOOD	[ cover ]	 If you judge a book by this cover you would NEVER venture inside
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I hope the Mgr
FOOD	[ O  ]	 sees this and cleans up
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't be fooled because it's in a truck stop, truckers know where there are good places to eat
FOOD	[ eclair ]	Stop here just for the desserts, I bought an eclair that must have weighed a pound, delicious, like they are supposed to be made
FOOD	[ Cream, coffee ]	Cream Puffs look like they wouldn't fit in a one pound coffee can
FOOD	[ O  ]	grin
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't miss this place
FOOD	[ hung ]	Continuing on my Saturday morning hangover theme: there's just something about a plateful of greasy food when you're slightly hung over that makes it all better
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Pine Cone has down-home, rib-sticking, greasy food in spades
FOOD	[ chicken fried steak, eggs ]	 The SO and I split the chicken fried steak, which comes with plenty of toast, hashbrowns, and two eggs
FOOD	[ gravy, biscuits, gravy, sausage, grease ]	 I could'nt finish mine!  The gravy must be the same that they use for biscuits and gravy, because it tasted sausage-y, and as my plate sat there I could see the grease rising to the top
FOOD	[ O  ]	 BUT--I didn't come here in search of health food, and it was just what the doctor ordered
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll work out later
FOOD	[ O  ]	Some times Jane and Michael Stern are on point and other times the story of the place beats the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I would definitely return to the Pine Cone
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's a bakery and diner attached to a truck stop on the Wisconsin highway
FOOD	[ Mexican, steak, butter ]	 I live in Chicago and work in a famous Mexican restaurant and I get up to Wisconsin for the old school steak and butter as much as possible: it gives me the energy to do my job
FOOD	[ eclairs, cream ]	 Pine Cone has eclairs and cream puffs the size of my cat
FOOD	[ cookie ]	 And I got a pig cookie
FOOD	[ steak, butter ]	 This little truck stop gives me the big energy to get even deeper into steak and butter territory
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like this location better than the one near Johnson's creek
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is a bit tight when you walk in, but the charm soon takes over
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was not really impressed by the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, their pastries won my over
FOOD	[ pie ]	 Try it all!  The pie was delicious
FOOD	[ apple ]	 I went with a simple apple selection
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Delicious, perfection
FOOD	[ apple ]	 It is nothing crazy, no fancy name but truthfully one of the best piece of classic apple you can find around here
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is a little slow but once again, it is a small restaurant with lots of charm
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You get what you get and I love it
FOOD	[ Christmas tree ]	 It is near a Christmas tree farm so it is the perfect place to stop and get some cocoa on your way
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place was excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were a little nervous because it is in a truck stop but the food was absolutely delicious and the service was fast and friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	OMG!  The bakery items at Pinecone are AMAZING!   Cinnamon rolls as big as your head and absolutely scrumptious!   The food in the restaurant is great for truck stop food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We've only come for breakfast but stop every single time we head up to Rhinelander,  WI
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Do NOT miss this place if even only for their baked goods!A really lovely surprise on a rather horrific family road trip
FOOD	[ peach ]	We were greeted at the door, the waitress was a peach, and the nice man who filled water/helped out was the sweetest guy ever
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	The food is also great if you're a fan of the diner-type grub; my hot turkey sandwich will live on in my dreams
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can definitely tell the place has the old time appeal of a great family place as all the locals (mostly older people) know each other and it's clear it's the happening place for breakfast with the over-60 crowd (but hey, that says the food has to be pretty homestyle and tasty to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	)  
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're headed down 94 and need a good lunch stop, make this it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very nice and clean place to have breakfast or lunchI eat here regularily because it is consistently good
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 Very large menu which makes it tough to choose but never disappointed!Unlimited hot coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't have any recollection of what I ate
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wanted t give it four stars, but that would be a very generous review for a meal I cannot recall
FOOD	[ O  ]	I know it was decently good, and it's like the only restaurant in Deforest
FOOD	[ O  ]	For that, I give it four stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Homestyle cooking at its best, dnt go to culvers, McDonald's or whatever trash is right off the hwy, head a bit further down u will find this gem, one of the reasons I love this place so much? They dnt play annoying music, scratch that, they don't play ANY music
FOOD	[ O  ]	People working here are super nice as to be expected
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I owned this joint, I would invest in a new bigger sign, as I drove right by this place and almost missed it twice
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice simple homey diner
FOOD	[ salad ]	Very friendly staff, huge family friendly menu, salad bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are on the road this beats the same old options
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love their breakfast menu & they have friendly waitstaff
FOOD	[ O  ]	We go there nearly every Friday for the last 4 yrs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I love that they don't play any music
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is quiet, conversational, and comfortable
FOOD	[ O  ]	Went here for lunch with two co-workers, checked Yelp before we went and the reviews were very positive so we decided to give it a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yikes! How can the reviews be 4-5 stars and the service at best "average", the food was terrible and myself and my co-workers all agreed, this restaurant doesn't rate two stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had one of the special Friday offerings, Smelt
FOOD	[ salad, fries ]	It came with a salad (very average but fresh), fries (ordinary) and the Smelt
FOOD	[ O  ]	After a 20-25 minute wait our server came with our orders
FOOD	[ O  ]	I looked at my plate and was shocked! There was 12-15 so-called Smelt about 3" long and deep fried
FOOD	[ batter ]	They looked like little fat cigarettes! I bit into one and it was all batter, I tried another and it was the same
FOOD	[ batter ]	I had deep fried batter for lunch!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I haven't had a meal this bad since I got out of the Navy! 
FOOD	[ Chicken Fried Steak ]	My co-workes meals were not much better, one had Chicken Fried Steak and he said it was made out of the box
FOOD	[ Cod ]	My other co-worker had the Cod and he said it was mushy and brown colored! YUK! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I hate to write such a negative review but this restaurant earned "one" star
FOOD	[ O  ]	Maybe they have great breakfast! I hope they do because their lunches are sub-par
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are other restaurants on this street/highway, I'd give them a try before I stopped here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I know my co-workers and I won't be coming back
FOOD	[ Cracker, Barrel ]	Don't have time and/or cute outfits for Madison but want an alternative to Cracker Barrel? This is your stop
FOOD	[ chicken, soup ]	I started with the chicken dumpling soup
FOOD	[ O  ]	Simply divine, so much as to seriously tempt my veg accomplice
FOOD	[ Cheese, curds ]	Cheese curds were another hit, far superior to those from the state fair
FOOD	[ mushrooms ]	 Wraps, sammys, even the fried mushrooms were consistent, wholesome, and fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was on point, our waitress Brianna was business pro
FOOD	[ O  ]	 People watching was a little poor(s), to be expected in rural Midwest? I think our impassioned debate over drug use might have startled the crowd
FOOD	[ Cracker, Barrel ]	Nonetheless, not a Cracker Barrel
FOOD	[ O  ]	Takes Amex
FOOD	[ O  ]	Huge menu, fresh tasty food, reasonable prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Beats a chain highway place for sure
FOOD	[ chicken, soup, celery, steak, French fries, coconut cream, pie ]	The chicken dumpling soup alone is worth a trip (fresh made every day and it caused my vegetable-phobic daughter to eat carrots and celery of her own voltion!);  the steak-cut French fries were great and the coconut cream pie was wonderful
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food was very good
FOOD	[ Reuben sandwich ]	I had the Reuben sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	My only suggestion is that the waitress should check back more often to see if we need anything
FOOD	[ O  ]	Otherwise, I recommend it
FOOD	[ O  ]	My boyfriend and I came here to have breakfast after New Years
FOOD	[ O  ]	We weren't expecting much being not at our best either
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service, as mentioned several times in yelp, is really slow
FOOD	[ O  ]	My drink was forgotten about and the next time our waitress came around she was serving our meal about 30-40 minutes from taking our order
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant was probably half full of people
FOOD	[ O  ]	My boyfriends meal was mediocre "at best" as he put it but my meal was worse
FOOD	[ bacon, egg, omelette, cheese ]	My bacon and egg omelette was burnt and the cheese was scarce
FOOD	[ O  ]	At the end of our meal, our server still charged us for the missing drink but they were kind enough to take it off the bill, that is while we waited 10 minutes standing at the register
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wouldn't go back to this restaurant because I think my time is worth more than they treated it but could be nice for those who think differently
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice clean place with a very friendly staff
FOOD	[ chicken, soup, club sandwich ]	 Great homemade chicken dumpling soup and a very tasty club sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Decor is outdated, but not sloppy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good local place to bring the family
FOOD	[ O  ]	Californians are all about the In-N-Out, where you can get your burger animal style
FOOD	[ Butter ]	And the Midwest is all about Culver's, where the Butter Burger is the thing to order
FOOD	[ O  ]	and I ate lunch here on our way between Milwaukee and Mosinee before going to my folks for Christmas
FOOD	[ cheddar, fries ]	I got a cheddar burger with fries, and C
FOOD	[ chicken, mashed potatoes, beans ]	got the two-piece chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and green beans
FOOD	[ O  ]	That's one of the things I love about Culver's
FOOD	[ fast food ]	Yes, it's a fast food restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	But they also do family restaurant food well
FOOD	[ chicken, beans ]	The chicken was good and the green beans really fresh, C
FOOD	[ O  ]	said
FOOD	[ Fast food ]	Fast food you can feel good about
FOOD	[ custard, flavor, almond ]	I also got a frozen custard, their flavor of the day: Swiss almond Christmas or something like that
FOOD	[ Chocolate, custard, almonds ]	Chocolate custard with slivered almonds
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yummo
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	I wanted ice cream so my husband pulled off the highway at this Culver's
FOOD	[ flavor, cookie, dough ]	We opted to get the flavor of the day (cookie dough craving)
FOOD	[ chocolate, custard, cookie, dough, custard ]	I was disappointed to find that it was a chocolate custard with TONS of cookie dough chunks because I like custard and not just the mix-ins, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	but it was overall a decent sundae
FOOD	[ fast food ]	I'll just stick to vanilla next time!Next to Chick-Fil-A, Culver's is my fav fast food chain
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Rarely is a snowboarding trip complete without Culver's to top off the day
FOOD	[ butter, red onions, fried cheese, curds ]	The butter burgers hit the spot (though mine was heavy on the red onions; good thing those are easily removeable), and the fried cheese curds are to die for
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You don't find those floating around just anywhere
FOOD	[ custard ]	 But if there is anything you MUST get, it's a cup of the frozen custard
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Damn, that's good stuff
FOOD	[ cheddar, butter, fried cheese, curds, flavor, custard ]	Go-to meal: cheddar butter burger, fried cheese curds, and flavor of the day custard
FOOD	[ cheddar, butter, American cheese ]	The difference between a deluxe burger and cheddar butter burger is that in the deluxe, you'll get American cheese
FOOD	[ lettuce, tomato ]	 And you have to pay 25 cents extra to add lettuce, tomato, etc
FOOD	[ cheddar, butter ]	to the cheddar butter burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	 File that away in your memory bank
FOOD	[ custard ]	Really good stuff!! The custard was great! I loved it and when I am back in the old USA I can only hope I will cross paths with another culvers
FOOD	[ cake, batter, cookie, dough ]	You know what the thing is with culvers? You actually don't need that much, it's sort of like eating cake batter or cookie dough
FOOD	[ custard ]	You can only have so much before you start getting that sickly feeling and start stirring that plastic spoon around and staring down the custard and wondering why you dont wanna finish
FOOD	[ custard, peanut butter ]	Yeah it's custard and it's heavy especially when you add every kind of peanut butter chocholate bar to the mix
FOOD	[ O  ]	Let me tell you those first five spoonfuls are pure goodness then it goes downhill
FOOD	[ O  ]	Less is more with this stuff let me tell you! Next time I am getting the smallest size, and I will be far more pleased and not guilty I threw out a mega size bucket
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hahaha!My meaty goodness
FOOD	[ bacon, cheese ]	why isn't Culvers a nationwide chain?  This bacon cheese burger is way too good to come out of a fastfood drive through window
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I had a nice little picnic on the tailgate of my pickup (driving cross country
FOOD	[ O  ]	long story)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I could not believe how great this burger was
FOOD	[ onion rings ]	The amazing part is the onion rings might be better than the burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're passing through Wisconsin, you need to stop at Culvers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love it!!!!! Love it!!!!!! love it!!!!!!!   Who doesn't love Culver's!Everything was great except for the burgers they are greasy and very charred compared to other stores
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really like both Chinese restaurants in town
FOOD	[ crab ]	 This one has outstanding crab rangoon
FOOD	[ chicken, peas, mushrooms, Chicken ]	 Love the chicken with snow peas and mushrooms and General Tso Chicken
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food is always ready in 10 minutes which is accurate
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good place and they give you free pop
FOOD	[ O  ]	Above average takeout with friendly staff
FOOD	[ noodle ]	The sauce on the pan fried noodle is tasty
FOOD	[ Dumplings ]	Dumplings are quite good
FOOD	[ Chang ]	We order from Chang Jiang often and have never been disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The menu is huge, and can accomodate anyone's taste buds
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service is quick, usually ready in 10 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grade: C
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is almost as good as the prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	Decent service
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have never eaten at the Green Lantern, but whatever
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What I HAVE done is gone to karaoke there
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am not the kind of person to enjoy a "hip" bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I don't want ironic metal on the jukebox or $8 flirtinis
FOOD	[ O  ]	  What I want is totally unpretentious karaoke renditions of Unskinny Bop from people that still look like they graduated high school in 1991, and $2
FOOD	[ vodka, cranberry ]	50 vodka and cranberry juices
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm sure if I drove far enough outside of Minneapolis I'd find a place about as awesome as the Green Lantern
FOOD	[ O  ]	Instead of doing all of that work, I just wish the Green Lantern would move into my backyard
FOOD	[ O  ]	I HATE bars where I feel like I have to do a lot of work just to try to have a good time
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not dressing up or drinking a certain drink just to feel like I have a shot of being accepted somewhere, believe me
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Green Lantern rules because it's completely laid back and totally unpretentious
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've seen such a wide variety of people there and everyone is always having a great time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Besides, the drinks are super strong and cheap - that alone is good enough for me
FOOD	[ dock ]	The biggest plus is it is on the lake with a dock and open for breakfest
FOOD	[ O  ]	That is huge if your a fan of a boating trip to eat 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll swing by soon to actually eat there again 
FOOD	[ O  ]	it's been 3 years since we had a boat
FOOD	[ O  ]	We did find a used boat 
FOOD	[ O  ]	now we may return
FOOD	[ O  ]	I guess that says a lot as without the boat, we do not go, with a boat, its a 6 out of 5 stars!!!!Who does not love the Greeny?  As some posts before me it is a place you can go and have a good time no matter what and just be you
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The staff is awesome and the food is decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But the Green lantern has something that other places try to imitate, atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have seen bar after bar try and create a fun atmosphere but they cannot
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The Greeny has it and I wish I could get there more than I do
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Green Lantern is the kind of place that comes in right above the Mendoza Line
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What I mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews
FOOD	[ bat ]	 I'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the Green Lantern isn't going to be my favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that I've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a Friday night
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The Green Lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely
FOOD	[ O  ]	My friend, however, absolutely loves this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 As such I've had cause to dine here many times over the years
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There are quite a few pluses
FOOD	[ Ale ]	 The bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including Ale Asylum offerings
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service has always been above average and I can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain
FOOD	[ onions, American cheese ]	 They've got Wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and American cheese
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And finally the Green Lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of McFarland
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping
FOOD	[ O  ]	The negatives: first and foremost I've always found the menu to be pretty limited
FOOD	[ fish, sandwiches, chicken, breast ]	 I'm not big on fish fry, and the Green Lantern's Friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree
FOOD	[ fish, fish ]	 Now as I said, I'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that I have ordered the fish I've been underwhelmed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill
FOOD	[ O  ]	 While I've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, I have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a Friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs
FOOD	[ O  ]	If it were just up to me I don't think I'd be going to the Green Lantern all that much
FOOD	[ fish, fries ]	 After all, I don't live in McFarland and I don't really go for supper club fish fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But so long as I know people that love going here I'll tag along and have a decent enough time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I think you'd be hard pressed not to at least be able to do that at the Green Lantern
FOOD	[ club sandwich, ham, cheese ]	We ate there several weeks back so the details are a bit thin, but I do recall that the service was good and we enjoyed the burger, club sandwich, and ham and cheese our group had
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Its exactly what you'd expect for a good supper club
FOOD	[ O  ]	Under ordinary circumstances I'm not a breakfast person
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, the morning after Thanksgiving, it was obviously time to consume more food, so off to the Green Lantern we went
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And a good thing too
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had the best breakfast I have eaten in recent memory, and left totally impressed (and full)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Breakfast foods are simple foods
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Many places take advantage of the simplicity by rushing things along
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You end up with edible but uninspired eats
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Though my breakfast arrived shortly after it was ordered, it was cooked properly and with care
FOOD	[ eggs ]	 My sunny side up eggs were perfectly done, the whites well set and the yolks warm but properly runny
FOOD	[ bacon ]	 The four (!) large slices of bacon were thick and flavorful
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I ordered the hash-browns crispy, and that's how they came
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Everything on the plate was cooked just right and tasted super good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I could almost like eating breakfast out, if every place served breakfast like this
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was fast and friendly
FOOD	[ Coffee ]	 Coffee was the usual diner style, weak and plentiful
FOOD	[ bloody mary ]	 The bar looked capable of producing a solid bloody mary, but alas this went untested
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Prices were as cheap as the day is long
FOOD	[ corn, beef, flavor ]	 I'm docking a star for the corn beef hash--it lacked flavor and that all important crunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All the same, I still highly recommend the Lantern for your breakfast needs
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ate breakfast here today; overall a really good atmosphere and some tasty items on the menu
FOOD	[ hash browns, cheese, ham, mushrooms ]	 I would recommend their Wiggies, a hodgepodge of hash browns, cheese, green peppers, diced ham, and mushrooms
FOOD	[ mimosa ]	I topped it off with a mimosa and
FOOD	[ dock ]	then my gf and I strolled out onto their dock and enjoyed some lakeside scene
FOOD	[ O  ]	We love The Green Lantern
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is wonderful and the price is great
FOOD	[ O  ]	We have never had a long wait for a table and once we are seated we are always waited on right away
FOOD	[ O  ]	All the staff is very friendly and atmosphere is welcoming
FOOD	[ O  ]	We have taken several friends here for dinner and always have a great time
FOOD	[ O  ]	We love this place!  This restaurant has excellent food!  It has been family owned for years and that is what makes the difference
FOOD	[ fish, fries ]	 Love being regulars here!  Friday night fish fries are always good
FOOD	[ Scallops ]	 Scallops are really worth trying
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Salads are always fresh
FOOD	[ Chili ]	 Chili is very thick and meaty
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place and staff are always welcoming even when you arrive by boat!  Highly recommend it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Be sure to  check out their specials on their awesome website!  http://www
FOOD	[ O  ]	thegreenlanternrestaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	com
FOOD	[ O  ]	Looking for "that" spot where the moment you walk in, you fit in?  
FOOD	[ O  ]	Looking for a home cooked meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	without having to lift a finger? 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Looking for a place to pop a squat and shoot the shit?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Look no further than the Greenie!  
FOOD	[ happy hour ]	Breakfast, lunch, happy hour or dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	it always fills the bill
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love taking the family there for weekend breakfast
FOOD	[ waffle, seafood ]	 From the waffle sundae for my youngest to the seafood omelet for me
FOOD	[ O  ]	they have it all
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Huge portions
FOOD	[ O  ]	great prices! 
FOOD	[ bloody mary, Cucumber, Vodka ]	Swing in and ask for my favorite bartender, Joy to make you her ultimate bloody mary made with Effen Cucumber Vodka
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Yeah
FOOD	[ O  ]	she rocks it
FOOD	[ all good ]	It's all good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Have eaten here several times,most recently this morning
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food has always been good but todays breakfast was exceptional
FOOD	[ eggs ]	I had eggs and walleye
FOOD	[ lobster ]	Large piece of walleye,flaky,lightly breaded,and delicious! Companion had lobster benedict special which was raved about
FOOD	[ O  ]	To top it off the service provided by April was outstanding
FOOD	[ O  ]	Life is good
FOOD	[ bloody mary ]	In bloody mary heaven
FOOD	[ O  ]	Joy's not bad either :-)Always good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Menu seems to have been updated recently
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lake perch really nicely done
FOOD	[ O  ]	Upper dining room has been remodeled
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quite nice!  A favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pros:
FOOD	[ O  ]	Drinks are ok
FOOD	[ steak, potato ]	Rib eye steak good medium rare with baked potato
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was friendly and food served warm
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food affordable
FOOD	[ O  ]	relaxing environment, local feel
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cons:
FOOD	[ Scallops ]	Scallops was to salty
FOOD	[ O  ]	furniture outdated
FOOD	[ fish ]	walleye fish was eh, not enough flavors
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's very Divey, not impressed even when my meal was free
FOOD	[ O  ]	We accidentally found Green Lantern when another local eatery was closed for Sunday night
FOOD	[ O  ]	We couldn't have been more happy that the other place was closed as Green Lantern had friendly service, tasty food, and the Packers on tv screens everywhere you looked
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a restaurant and bar, and the building isn't modern, so leave any judgmental aesthetic attitudes at home (or, in our case, the hotel room) and go enjoy something other than another boring chain
FOOD	[ Fish ]	Friday Night Fish Fry! reasonable prices and good service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Go with the standards and you will enjoy!This place is like an old up-north supper club
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's dark and cozy with orange light lanterns hanging from the ceiling
FOOD	[ O  ]	The upper seating level has a lovely view of the lake
FOOD	[ lobster, tarragon ]	I got the lobster omelet and it had this wonderful, flavorful tarragon sauce over the top
FOOD	[ lobster ]	Big chunks of lobster made it a memorable breakfast
FOOD	[ english muffin ]	My english muffin was perfectly toasted and buttered
FOOD	[ O  ]	My companion recommends trying the walleye breakfast next time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our server was very very very nice and sweet
FOOD	[ O  ]	Several times she uttered "take your time, no hurry
FOOD	[ O  ]	" I hear that's the Green Lantern's tag line: loitering encouraged
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like to relax, so this place is perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I lived in the area I'd go there for drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	Never had a bad meal here, breakfast lunch or dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Prices are very reasonable and the people are very welcoming
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 One thing that needs improvement is the coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I think they let the hot water wink at the grounds
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Way to weak
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food, cheap drinks, great service
FOOD	[ cheese, onions, ham, green pepper ]	Breakfast is simple, but delicious here- get the Wiggies (hashbrowns with cheese, onions, ham and green pepper inside)
FOOD	[ Sandwiches, fish ]	Sandwiches are also good, and it's a great place for fish fry
FOOD	[ FISH, fish, fish, salad ]	FISH FRY was OUT OF THIS WORLD! I read an article in Madison magazine about how this place had one of the best fish fry's in town and decided to try it out! What a gem! First, The fish fry comes with salad and a side
FOOD	[ O  ]	Super Nice
FOOD	[ tartar sauce ]	 Secondly, they must have the world's best tartar sauce! I could literally drink the stuff
FOOD	[ fish, Bucks, fish ]	Third, I took five people here who all had the fish fry and drinks and it only set me back 60 Bucks! WOW! I will be back!The man and I are on this thing now where we are trying to eat at a few places famous for their fish fry's thanks to an article in Madison Magazine
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There are a few places in the mag that I am looking forward to trying but Green Lantern was the first one that we hit up
FOOD	[ beat ]	Driving up the place looked kind of small and beat up which was not what I was expecting and not looking forward to
FOOD	[ O  ]	 As we got closer however I realized how big this place was on the inside
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's huge!   At least it felt huge from where we were sitting
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm not sure if it was the article in the magazine that attributed to how crazy busy this place was or if there was a concert or what but this place was insane
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I mean we had to wait for an hour for our table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 On the plus side we had to wait an hour for our table which meant an hour of drinking so I can't really complain
FOOD	[ O  ]	Because we had been waiting for so long we also had a chance to look at the menu so when we  finally sat down we knew exactly what we wanted; the waitress loved this
FOOD	[ calamari ]	 We started with the calamari which I'm starting to find out is not one of Wisconsin's strong suits
FOOD	[ calamari, Calamari ]	 I don't think I have ever had good calamari here; maybe this will be my next food challenge 'The Great Calamari Showdown'!  Anyway, I had a few pieces of that and let the man have the rest'' he actually really liked it
FOOD	[ salad, mashed potato, cod ]	I ordered the salad which was huge, cheesy mashed potato, and 3 pieces of the lightly breaded cod
FOOD	[ hash browns ]	 The man order the same but with cheesy hash browns
FOOD	[ fish ]	 The fish was pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was juicy and fresh and not bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I thought it was maybe just a little over the top with the seasoning
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I think I would have enjoyed it more if the flavors were a bit more subtle as opposed to all up in my face the way it was
FOOD	[ O  ]	 With that said however I though it was alright
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The man on the other hand was in love
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He likened his enjoyment of this place to the Tornado Room
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Pure blasphemy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He clearly doesn't know anything about food
FOOD	[ O  ]	All in all I am glad I tried this place but I don't think I will be making it a regular haunt
FOOD	[ O  ]	Stopped in for a dinner after getting a recommendation from a co worker and we were VERY impressed!  It was fairly quiet on a Thursday night - no problem getting a table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The location is fabulous being right on the lake with views
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The ambiance is very much a north-woods tavern restaurant type establishment - older decor, a little kitschy, though it suits the place, well
FOOD	[ O  ]	Green Lantern has a reputation of being a surf-turf and they do it well!
FOOD	[ Ahi, tuna, fish ]	I had the Ahi-tuna - it was an incredibly delicate piece of fish cooked perfectly
FOOD	[ steak ]	 My wife had a steak which was also prepared very well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We are DEFINITELY coming back!
FOOD	[ O  ]	The server, while young and a bit 'nervous', did a fine job and she was very pleasant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She also provided great suggestions for food pairings!  Well done :)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hint:  Ask for a seat by the window to get a view of the lake
FOOD	[ O  ]	hint hint:  The location, ambiance, and setup is VERY family and kid friendly!  They were hosting a birthday party for a grandmother while we were there and the staff bent-over backwards for the family and party - including setting up a powerpoint projector for family slide show and music!  Very sweet
FOOD	[ O  ]	Been here a few times
FOOD	[ O  ]	Once for breakfast and few times for drinks/apps
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food has been very good and the service is decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	They don't have the best view of the lake but we'll still be back
FOOD	[ fish ]	Any place that's located on a lake for a fish fry is alright with me
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's packed on Friday which means you get to have a few cocktails while waiting for a table, the wait is worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't hesitate to try this place out you won't be disappointed
FOOD	[ fish, fish, fish ]	are favorite fish fry in madison area get there before 530 if you dont want to awhile friendly staff both the bar and the waitstaff good burgers and steaks recomend the sea fod platter nice view of the lake good stop for lunch when out boating easy access pier go most for fish fry good hashbrown solid kids menu very reasonable prices can feed family of 5 for around 40 to 50 dollars with cocktailsWent last Friday to try the famous fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Arrived at 5:50pm and was quoted a 25-30 minute wait, which I found acceptable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We were not called until 55 minutes later, and this only happened when I brought my two young sons and sat on the floor conspicuously in plain view of the host stand
FOOD	[ O  ]	 At that point we were offered the "quick alternative" of a table downstairs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Where was this option earlier?
FOOD	[ lent ]	Look, we knew going out on the first Friday of lent would result in a wait and we brought a myriad of distractions along to kill time for our 4 and 2 year olds
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Those wear thin, however, when the wait is double what you are initially told and have subsequently relayed to the kids
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Maybe this is all due to an inexperienced host
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our server was very attentive and the food was good
FOOD	[ beer, fish ]	 We tried the baked, beer-battered, and fried fish
FOOD	[ potatoes, french fries ]	 We also had baked potatoes and french fries as well as salads
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Overall, this was not the best Madison has to offer
FOOD	[ rush ]	 We may return, but would only due so as a just a couple or as a family if we could arrive before the rush
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Lantern doesn't profess to be anything more than it is
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good American, wisco supper club fare
FOOD	[ cook, steak ]	Prices are very good, and they know how to cook a steak to temperature
FOOD	[ Bloody Mary ]	Bloody Mary's are great as they allow you to add your own seasonings to taste
FOOD	[ wine, glass ]	 Decent wine selection by the glass
FOOD	[ sambuca ]	 They even have sambuca
FOOD	[ O  ]	Try the surf n turf
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very good at a great price
FOOD	[ fried chicken ]	Also fried chicken
FOOD	[ choice ]	Solid choice, and nicest place on lake waubesa
FOOD	[ O  ]	We went to the Green Lantern last Friday and it was our first visit there
FOOD	[ Fish ]	Several of our friends had always spoken highly of it so we thought we would give their Friday Fish fry a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had made reservations for us and when we got to the restaurant they informed us it would just be a few more minutes and that we could take a seat at the bar
FOOD	[ mushrooms, cocktail ]	The bartender was very nice and intuitive, he noticed I was eying up the pickled mushrooms and gave me some for my cocktail
FOOD	[ O  ]	A few minutes later we were promptly seated so the wait was not long at all
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were seated at a nice table by the window with a view of the lake
FOOD	[ O  ]	So far so good
FOOD	[ appetizer, beer, cod, fish, shrimp ]	We ordered a kalamari appetizer to share, three beer battered cod fish fry dinners and one breaded shrimp dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	The kalamari came first and it was ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our drinks were finished so we ordered more
FOOD	[ beer ]	Finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals
FOOD	[ O  ]	So we reminded her again
FOOD	[ fish, fish ]	My fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky
FOOD	[ fish ]	My moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing
FOOD	[ cole, slaw, hash browns ]	The cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns I had ordered were good as well
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	My partners shrimp though was awful
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was greasy and mushy and tasted awful
FOOD	[ French fries, potato ]	The French fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted
FOOD	[ fish, shrimp, fries ]	Our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finally we asked another waitress if she could find her
FOOD	[ shrimp, potatoes ]	When we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which I really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was
FOOD	[ O  ]	She did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment
FOOD	[ coleslaw, fish ]	Like I said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Next time we are going to Tobys nearby instead
FOOD	[ O  ]	They consistently serve quality food along with good service
FOOD	[ O  ]	What could I possibly say about the Beach House Restaurant and Lounge?  I guess I could think of a few things
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America
FOOD	[ Fish ]	 Fish fry anyone?
FOOD	[ O  ]	To begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose
FOOD	[ O  ]	Do not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking
FOOD	[ O  ]	 God bless America
FOOD	[ eggs ]	The AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast
FOOD	[ broccoli ]	 I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated)
FOOD	[ O  ]	So give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin
FOOD	[ ice, bloody Mary ]	 Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Just be
FOOD	[ scrambled eggs ]	 And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side
FOOD	[ tartar sauce ]	 And don't you dare forget the tartar sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was terrible! I will never return!!! We waited in the bar and were never greeted or spoken too
FOOD	[ O  ]	People walked in after us and were seated
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not sure what their structure is for seating, but they suck at it
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will not be back
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is pretty dumpy - "Corinthian leather" chairs, crappy tables
FOOD	[ eggs ]	What is worth going for is the walleye and eggs served on weekends
FOOD	[ eggs, potatoes ]	 It is a HUGE portion of walleye, lighty fried, served with eggs cooked to order, potatoes and toast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All this for something like $10
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Totally worth a side trip if you are in Madison
FOOD	[ FISH, fish ]	Amazing Friday night FISH FRY! I got out a lot for fish fry's in Madison and the surrounding area and this still remains my favorite
FOOD	[ Cod, soup, salad ]	I usually get the Cod dinner, which is always cooked perfect, not too soggy or too crispy, which comes with a side AND a soup or salad for only $9
FOOD	[ O  ]	95
FOOD	[ fish ]	I always recommend the Beach House when someone is looking for a GREAT fish fry! :)For being surrounded by two lakes, Madison doesn't do a great job of having places to drink on the water
FOOD	[ O  ]	Head down to McFarland and check out the beach house
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's like a dive bar slash restaurant right on the lake
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tons of windows
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not a bad place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Can't comment on the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Drink specials were solid
FOOD	[ fish ]	This place has good steaks,and fish fry
FOOD	[ bacon, filet, lobster ]	I also like the saturday special bacon wrapped filet, with lobster tail,all for 24
FOOD	[ soup, salad, potato, butter ]	99 I think? All the dinners come with soup or salad, potato choic,warm rolls w/ butter
FOOD	[ cod ]	Walleye,cod,bluegill are all delecious
FOOD	[ beer ]	Good place for a beer as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great view, and drink specials
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a real Sconnie place,Wisco to the core
FOOD	[ Fish ]	My fave Fish Fry spot for sure
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have not Yelped in quite a while and to all my fans (all none of you)
FOOD	[ O  ]	sorry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So I will start on a positive note
FOOD	[ O  ]	So I have been to the Beach House so many times I feel dumb reviewing it but I am so deal with it and go there
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are going for drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	do it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The clientele is awesome and you will always hear some great stories
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But this review is for the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 ALWAYS AMAZING!  We went for breakfast the other day for the first time in a long time and it was as good as I remember
FOOD	[ Eggs Benedict, Bloody Mary ]	 The Eggs Benedict are just delicious and something I could eat every day and they make one hell of a Bloody Mary (so I am told by my wife since I do not like them) if your interest in that
FOOD	[ O  ]	So if you want some good breakfast on the weekend and in the McFarland area
FOOD	[ O  ]	Breach House it is!Nasty & Dirty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food is okay
FOOD	[ steak ]	 They do a great steak
FOOD	[ beer ]	 The place is full of regulars drinking cheap beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had dinner at the Beach House on Friday on our way up to northern Wisconsin based on reviews on Yelp
FOOD	[ fish ]	 If you are looking for good fish fry the Beach House has it
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 I had the perch which was great, my bf had the walleye which i think had an even better flavor
FOOD	[ fish ]	 The fish deserves 5 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Everything else a 3 star
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I would give 3 1/2 stars if that were an option
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Would definitely go back
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really wanted to like this place but it wasn't what we were looking for
FOOD	[ fish ]	They have a great spot on the lake but it is a pretty dumpy little fish shanty
FOOD	[ O  ]	  If that is what you are looking for, you will love it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There were a bunch of locals there having a good time and if we were there with a group of our friends it might be ok for a few beers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But still way way too crowded
FOOD	[ sardines ]	 Like sardines in a can
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was no one to greet us so we just took a table by the window
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Then we waited and waited
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Then someone came over and said hi
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Then we waited and waited
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was about to get up and leave when someone came over and said, "oh, you haven't been waited on yet?"  So she then tried to help things along
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ sandwiches, Ahi, Tuna ]	The menu was average for sandwiches but overpriced, we felt, for entrees as we ordered the Ahi Tuna and the Bluegill
FOOD	[ Tuna ]	  The Tuna was very good and perhaps appropriately priced but the Bluegill was not proportionately enough
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 It was made well enough and had ok flavor but should have been a few dollars less
FOOD	[ Salad ]	Salad was ok
FOOD	[ greens ]	 At least had a variety of greens but still needed a little more
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I ever went back it would be for a few beers and the view, that's it
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's too bad because we really need some nice places on the lake and with all the lakes around here there aren't as many lakeside restaurants as you would expect
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is the quintessential mom and pop bar / restaurant on a lake
FOOD	[ beer ]	They specialize in cheap beer and great food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Staff is friendly and down home, but you'd better leave your big-city attitude at home
FOOD	[ fish ]	We went for a Friday night fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	I live in Seattle these days and was not about to miss the opportunity while in town
FOOD	[ Lite ]	Started with a couple of Spotted Cows (on tap!) while the rest drank Miller Lite
FOOD	[ O  ]	(Told ya
FOOD	[ O  ]	) There were five adults plus a 12-year old
FOOD	[ O  ]	Walleye was excellent, the waitress was too
FOOD	[ O  ]	We made reservations and the table was ready well ahead of time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our one tactical error was sitting in the bar for the view
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was LOUD! Think that the dining room is much quieter
FOOD	[ O  ]	Notice that I am not saying much about the food? Here's the deal:
FOOD	[ O  ]	- It was Friday
FOOD	[ O  ]	- It was Hot
FOOD	[ beer ]	- The beer was Cold
FOOD	[ fish ]	- The fish fry was exactly what you would expect in a place like this: great walleye!
FOOD	[ O  ]	'Nough said
FOOD	[ O  ]	We live just down from the Beach House
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We love going there
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are super friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	We usually do not have to wait to be seated
FOOD	[ breakfasts ]	The weekend breakfasts are the best
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bloody Marys are outstanding
FOOD	[ crab, eggs Benedict ]	Love the crab cakes eggs Benedict
FOOD	[ eggs ]	Yum! Huge portion of walleye with your eggs which is one of my friends favs when they come visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is a great local hangout too, beautiful view, easy parking for your boat from lake waubesa
FOOD	[ O  ]	We recommend it always!Now I must state one little thing about the way I rate restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	My ratings are relative to my expectations of the experience and in no way relative to other restaurants, (it just isn't fair to use the same scale for a place like the Beach House as you would for The French Laundry so again, it's all relative) 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've only been here for breakfast but the second time I drove a long damn way to have breakfast again so that in and of it self should say something
FOOD	[ O  ]	(another caveat: there are maybe six restaurants in McFarland that don't have drive-thrus)  
FOOD	[ eggs, bloody mary, beer ]	I ordered the Walleye and eggs both times along with a bloody mary (gotta love a beer back, yay for Wisconsin)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now I am well aware of the number of bones that a whole Walleye contains and cannot in any way hold the Beach House responsible for that
FOOD	[ fish ]	I can say that the breading was perfectly crispy and well seasoned and that the fish was not at all over cooked, nice and moist
FOOD	[ fish ]	plus I think it cost $10 which was awesome (you can't get fish for breakfast at these prices in Chicago) 
FOOD	[ potatoes, potatoes, meat, cheese ]	For me the biggest highlight of breakfast here is what they do to the potatoes (their name for them is eluding me at the moment) by request they will top your breakfast potatoes with a heap of meat, veggies and cheese, enough to make it a hangover-soaking-up meal unto itself
FOOD	[ O  ]	To sum it all up: if you find yourself looking for breakfast and a little "hair o' the dog" in McFarland Wisconsin because "What happens at the Beach House, stays at the Beach House" and we all love that about any restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	I use to boat in this area alot
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I always made this place to stop for  breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	very good

FOOD	[ O  ]	 Anything on the menu is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nice place on the water
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You can come by boat or car
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you come by boat a nice little ride over to Madison area makes it a fun day

FOOD	[ O  ]	 We come here often
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food is always good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Drinks are made by some really awesome people!  Specials are always worth a look

FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very very good!!Excellent dinner
FOOD	[ steak, Scallops ]	Had a New York Strip steak and Scallops for $22
FOOD	[ O  ]	00Food was very good and the atmosphere is the classic divey Wisconsin bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only way it could be better was if they added outdoor service/outdoor bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	We will be back!I've been to this place a couple of times and we've always had good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was a bit slow, but will definitely keep going back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love being so close to Lake Waubesa and watching the sunsets too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food and service have always been good
FOOD	[ seafood ]	 The seafood dinner was done perfectly
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Beach house is probably one of our favorite breakfast places
FOOD	[ eggs ]	The walleye and eggs are truly a specialty
FOOD	[ fish ]	Their fish fry is also very good and they have a nice view of lake Wabesa
FOOD	[ O  ]	If they expanded food and drinks outside, they'd have a 5 star
FOOD	[ O  ]	I got a Groupon for here for my fiancee and mine's anniversary, and we finally were able to get there a month later
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The restaurant was super easy to find and I loved how it was right on the lake
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I spent a lot of time the last few summers in northern WI on a lake, so it was nice to be back on a lake again- brought back good memories!  We did not make a reservation, so it was an hour wait for a table when we arrived
FOOD	[ hung ]	 We hung out in the slightly crowded bar and had a few drinks while we were waiting
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The drinks were good and the bartenders were attentive, so no complaints there!  We were seated at a table that had a great view of the lake
FOOD	[ fish, cheese, curds ]	 They had lots of specials going on that night (Friday night fish!), and we started with pepperjack cheese curds
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Delish!  They had a really nice bite at the end of them from the peppers
FOOD	[ blue gill, salmon ]	 I got the blue gill/lake perch combo and my fiancee got the Caribbean salmon
FOOD	[ blue gill, fish, fish, batter ]	 I know blue gill is a thinner fish, and while my dish was good, there was not a lot of actual fish under the batter
FOOD	[ salad, fish, tomato, basil, vinaigrette, coleslaw ]	 I got a salad with my fish with a tomato basil vinaigrette, which was surprisingly good and coleslaw which was pretty standard
FOOD	[ salmon, broccoli ]	 The salmon with the Caribbean dipping sauce was fantastic, but the veggies he got as a side was just some steamed broccoli and carrots- not very creative!  Our server was attentive all night, even though the restaurant was super busy all night
FOOD	[ O  ]	 By the time we left, I was very full and satisfied
FOOD	[ fish ]	Went here for fish fry with one of my friends and we ended up sitting outside and watching the sunset
FOOD	[ cod ]	Our server was very nice and the food was SOOOO good! I had the fried cod and she had the walleye
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were both impressed and full after the meal
FOOD	[ fries, asparagus ]	My favorite part - the price - very affordable and you get to pick your sides, which were also really good, american fries and asparagus
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd highly recommend and I'm going back!Stopped here while on a Sunday drive
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Tried sitting outside and the waitress did not make us feel welcomed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She was rude and careless
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We walked inside to the bar where the bartenders were a lot better
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Unfortunately the same lady came in and started venting about her customers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Seems like they have enough customers and do not need to be nice anymore
FOOD	[ beer ]	 Too bad because the beer was nice and cold
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great views too
FOOD	[ bomb, salmon, fish ]	It was ok - waitress was very good - even with 7:45 Friday night reservations no tables were available and had a very long wait - drunk patron at the bar swearing very loud with the F-bomb and other words and slamming items on the bar - first ordered the salmon special and of course it was already sold out - two of us then ordered the fish fry mine was lukewarm and the other one was cold
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't plan on going back
FOOD	[ Murphy, pizza ]	I took my mom and grandma to the Beach House last night for dinner thinking it would be better than getting a Papa Murphy's pizza
FOOD	[ O  ]	There weren't many patrons in the dining room
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our waitress was very short with us, demanding our drink orders before taking any questions or orders for our food
FOOD	[ scallops ]	I ordered scallops, and when they came to the table they were overcooked, but also cold
FOOD	[ O  ]	It took me at least 15 minutes to find the waitress to ask if I could get warmer food
FOOD	[ fork ]	She said that she would have the kitchen make up a new meal, and about 15 minutes later she returned with my same plate, with my original fork and original food
FOOD	[ scallops, flavor ]	They scallops were now warm, but lacked flavor, and were even tougher than before
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitress didn't seem to care about the quality of the food and seemed to be either having a terrible night or was on the influence of something
FOOD	[ O  ]	Needless to say, I will not be returning
FOOD	[ O  ]	On a positive note, the sunset on the lake is pretty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Later in the night, not very crowded yet they insisted we sit crowded next to another pair of people
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service was slow, just getting a drink was an effort
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food was poorly prepared and over cooked, or as in my partners case cold
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No way coming back other than drinks in the summer
FOOD	[ O  ]	we found this place on a groupon deal and were excited to try a new place
FOOD	[ fish ]	It was a train wreck! The dining area was not very busy even tho it was a Friday night fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	That should have been our first clue
FOOD	[ steak, lobster, steak, lobster ]	We ordered the steak and lobster, The steak was very good, but the lobster was still raw
FOOD	[ O  ]	We sent it back to be re warmed, and still returned undercooked
FOOD	[ O  ]	we decided to take it "to go" and finish cooking it at home
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband and I love our bloody marys & this is NOT the place to order one
FOOD	[ O  ]	blah
FOOD	[ O  ]	Needless to say, we will not be back, nor recommend this place to anyone else
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would not have known about this place had it not been for the Holiday Groupon
FOOD	[ O  ]	I redeemed mine with my bf over the weekend, and the food was delicious and cooked well (see Holiday Groupon pic)
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant was packed on Saturday night; I'm glad I called in a reservation
FOOD	[ O  ]	Local town folk
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not a huge place but still cozy
FOOD	[ O  ]	The servers were running around and busy but made sure that our table was attended well
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ask for Dee Dee; she's a trip! I'll be back again for more food once the snow has melted to try the other items on the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ate there last night with a group of friends
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night
FOOD	[ french onion soup, salt ]	 I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick
FOOD	[ croutons, soup, soup, liquid ]	 Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I ordered the bluegill for my main dish
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This bluegill, however, was not good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was cold and tasted very old
FOOD	[ fries ]	 The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was quite bummed about this
FOOD	[ O  ]	It you're basic bar food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nothing more
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great place on the water
FOOD	[ O  ]	Beautiful views
FOOD	[ fish ]	Good fish fry
FOOD	[ fish ]	Very reasonable prices with nice selection of fish and sides
FOOD	[ bowels ]	The staff are great!Do you like it when your bowels want to explode?  Then this is the place for you
FOOD	[ aroma, pizza ]	 The sad thing is, the aroma coming from the restaurant is hypnotizing as it drifts through the neighborhood, and the staff is really nice, but holy jeebus, does the pizza suck
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Every time we went there we spent the rest of the night in the bathroom
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Awful
FOOD	[ pizza ]	Great little bar, friendly bartenders (unlike the *other* Spartan- ahem!) and super pizza
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A little on the smoky side, except for a one-day-per week smoke free Saturday, so time your visits accordingly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Decor in the restaurant could use some updating, but it's a small-town family owned joint that is what it is
FOOD	[ Pizza ]	Spartan Pizza is going smoke-free on March 1, 2010, well ahead of the ban
FOOD	[ Pizza ]	 Way to go, Spartan!!!We went there for the first time yesterday, and I would definitely recommend Spartan Pizza
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Here's why:
FOOD	[ O  ]	- the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top
FOOD	[ savory ]	- the sauce is sweet and savory
FOOD	[ cheese ]	- the cheese is rich and delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	- the veggies were fresh and tasty
FOOD	[ Canadian bacon, onions, olives, mushroom ]	We ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think)
FOOD	[ Canadian bacon, meat ]	 The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I've had 
FOOD	[ O  ]	not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store
FOOD	[ bacon, olives ]	 The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that
FOOD	[ salad, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, pizza, salad ]	We also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2?  I'd bet the pizza salad is much better
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was casual and friendly
FOOD	[ appearance ]	In regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar
FOOD	[ pizza ]	I should also note that the plates for eating pizza are plastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is a "no frills" kind of place
FOOD	[ pizza, Pizza ]	Good pizza (not like Pizza Hut, more like home-made) with a great bar with nice, friendly service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good enough for carry-out in McFarland on a cold winter's evening
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Ready on time, never had a wrong order, and they're at least reasonably friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Would be better if they delivered, but not sure there's a huge demand for it in our tiny burg
FOOD	[ buffet ]	 They also have a lunch buffet on weekdays for around $6
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best Chinese food madison! I've tried them all and make the 15 minute drive every week :-)Awful, awful, awful
FOOD	[ cookie ]	 The worst of the worst of the cookie-cutter Chinese restaurants
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 Food without flavor, a menu without imagination and a staff of such profound indifference it's hard to tell they're even there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tried this because it's local
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Terrible, bland Chinese food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not much else to say
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Will never return
FOOD	[ chicken, fried chicken, bowl ]	 My wife wanted me to mention her sweet and sour chicken, which was battered fried chicken pieces with a side of sauce in a bowl
FOOD	[ vegetables, pineapple ]	 When she asked where the vegetables were (like the picture), she was told there is a piece of pineapple in the sauce and that is what comes with it
FOOD	[ pineapple ]	 As promised, we looked hard into the sauce and found one very small piece of pineapple
FOOD	[ Appetite ]	 Bon Appetite
FOOD	[ O  ]	Main Moon is hand's down my favorite place to grab Chinese in McFarland, but really anywhere
FOOD	[ O  ]	No matter what time of day, day of the week, or week of the year - it only takes 15 minutes to get your food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Freshly made each time too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't order from the pictures, order from you heart
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff is so friendly, I'm thinking about proposing in the near future, as I hope to be a part of their family like they've been a part of mine
FOOD	[ buffet ]	I just can't even talk about the lunch buffet, I'll start tearing up with how amazing the deal is
FOOD	[ O  ]	Andddd, I just shed a tear
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum yum yum in my tum tum tum
FOOD	[ buffet ]	Miss you, Main Moon xoxoxMain Moon has the best lunch in McFarland, buffet style
FOOD	[ menus, sauces ]	Friendly service, gloriously large takeout menus, and sauces like no one else
FOOD	[ pork, dumplings, crab ]	Try their fried pork dumplings, crab Rangoon, or General Tso's
FOOD	[ fried rice ]	Their fried rice is legit
FOOD	[ O  ]	All portions are generous
FOOD	[ O  ]	Until secondary Moons are established, make your lunar landing as soon as you can
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Leaps and bounds better than other chinese food in the Madison area
FOOD	[ buffet ]	Their lunch buffet is a great value
FOOD	[ O  ]	The general tsao's is to die for
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't miss out on this fantastic food
FOOD	[ Bay ]	Just fair, but you learn to appreciate decent chinese food for its rarity (I know, a strange concept for those of us living in the Bay Area)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Authentic good quality food in an old style Chinese restaurant setting
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very satisfied overall with my first visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Second visit included my six year old which was not so good, they don't even have crayons for a child
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a good Chinese place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Will it take you to a place you've never been? No
FOOD	[ O  ]	But you will leave satisfied
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food: It's overall pretty good and probably one of the more reliable options for semi-authentic Chinese food in the Madison area
FOOD	[ O  ]	 To this Asian, there is definitely some catering to Western palates
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Definitely a step down if you're used to eating at, say, Chicago's Chinatown (both old and new sections), and there's no extra menu in Chinese with the more eclectic stuff
FOOD	[ seafood ]	 Fresh seafood options very limited
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service: Average
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food comes in a reasonable time, though refiling the water sometimes is spotty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value: Reasonable overall
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Prices fit the portions
FOOD	[ O  ]	Most entrees $9-15 range
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall: Good for when you crave Chinese, but I'd still head to Chicago for the more authentic stuff
FOOD	[ O  ]	Three stars = A-OK
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It wasn't great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This place has been here for about 30 years
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Before that it was a car wash
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I always think of it as the place that used to be a carwash
FOOD	[ O  ]	Anyway
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Went with a group of 15
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Mom was buying and we got the "Classic" banquet (the cheapest one)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was more food than we could eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food was fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not awesome
FOOD	[ flavor, hoisin sauce ]	 The best flavor was hoisin sauce and, well, that comes out of a jar
FOOD	[ sesame, chicken, chicken, citrus ]	We got a sesame chicken that had nicely deepfried chicken chunks in a citrus-y sweet sauce
FOOD	[ trout ]	 Some trout that my sister insisted on and really enjoys (not my thing, but everyone else liked it)
FOOD	[ pork ]	 Mu-shu pork - it was good
FOOD	[ beef ]	 Delightful (?) beef, kinda bland, but nothing yucky in it
FOOD	[ duck ]	 Aaaannd, oh yeah, crispy duck
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very crispy, as in dry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not so great
FOOD	[ fortune cookies ]	The kids got those finger trap toys with their fortune cookies
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waitress was cheerful, accomodating and informative
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Extra help came out when needed
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think some of the best Chinese food in Madison
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 A little pricey but a few dishes always feeds me for at least two additional meals
FOOD	[ O  ]	Imperial Garden has been around a long time and seems to be a local favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	That struck me as a very bad sign when I came to Madison almost 20 years ago, and that continues to be the case
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is insipid, blandly spiced to appeal to unadventurous midwestern tastes and with a menu reminiscent of the Americanized Chinese palaces of the 1950s
FOOD	[ O  ]	I end up there with various groups on occasion, but try to keep it to no more frequent than once every five years (more frequently in my first years in Madison, less so now)
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's not that there are vastly superior authentic Chinese options (although I prefer P
FOOD	[ Chang, Indian ]	Chang's, recognizing its limitations), but one does better with other Asian options when in Madison--particularly Thai/Laotian, but also Indian (with many new options in recent years)
FOOD	[ China ]	It's perhaps the closest you can get to authetic Chinese food in a place like Madison, particularly after China Palace closed
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is alright, it's been embellished in a way to appeal to an American audience, but at least the some of the menu choices are pretty real
FOOD	[ fish dish, filet, fish ]	My real problem with this place is the service: The menu was misinforming and didn't specify that some steamed fish dish was a filet as opposed to a whole fish
FOOD	[ O  ]	I politely complained to the waitress about my order not being accurate and she informed her manager
FOOD	[ steak ]	The manager only ended up refunding me 50% off the item ordered and began telling me how you wouldn't refund someone a fancy steak in an expensive restaurant!
FOOD	[ O  ]	In the end, I paid for my meal and tipped the poor waitress, but I will never visit this place again
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not sure if that manager woman was giving me a hard time because I was a young college student or what, but her management skills leave much to be desired
FOOD	[ O  ]	This was, quite possibly, the WORST Chinese food (if you can call it that) that I've ever eaten in my life
FOOD	[ appetizer ]	We started with the appetizer platter for two
FOOD	[ calamari ]	 The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth
FOOD	[ egg rolls, salt ]	 The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt
FOOD	[ shrimp, barbecue, pork, dumplings ]	 The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned
FOOD	[ O  ]	Then came the entrees
FOOD	[ Chicken ]	 I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was wrong
FOOD	[ chicken, flavor ]	 The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor
FOOD	[ Tofu ]	My boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu
FOOD	[ spice, scallions ]	 He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions)
FOOD	[ tofu ]	 The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible
FOOD	[ O  ]	Apart from the horrendous food was the tepid service
FOOD	[ glass ]	 I had to ask several times for a glass of water
FOOD	[ glass, glass ]	 The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass
FOOD	[ glass ]	 By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I tried to ask for some, but she walked away
FOOD	[ Mozart ]	Plus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Skip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door
FOOD	[ Pork ]	 On Fridays, they receive shipments of Pork Bao in from a bakery in Chicago that are to die for!Probably the best Chinese in Madison these days
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Unfortunately, that is not saying much
FOOD	[ O  ]	Took four kids tonight and we were all underwhelmed
FOOD	[ chicken, egg, soup ]	The chicken egg drop soup was oddly sweet
FOOD	[ barbecue, pork, beef, gravy ]	We got a barbecue pork dish and some beef dish that both had a bland gravy
FOOD	[ O  ]	A huge platter of pot stickers that got everyone excited but ended up being 
FOOD	[ O  ]	bland
FOOD	[ soy sauce ]	Even the dipping sauce just tasted like soy sauce
FOOD	[ calamari ]	The calamari was not tough
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll give them that
FOOD	[ O  ]	If this is the best Chinese food around
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm sorry
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best chinese is Madison by far, but very expensive! You do always get great service though
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum!We visit family in Madison at least twice a year and always make sure to have dinner here
FOOD	[ shrimp, rice soup ]	 The shrimp sizzling rice soup is absolutely to die for, and every entree I've had has been fabulous
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Hands down the best Chinese food I have ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is wonderful
FOOD	[ gluten ]	 One, Almost anything on the menu can be made gluten free
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Two, They have about 7 different types of loose teas to choose from
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Three, The food is GREAT!
FOOD	[ dishes, Rice Soup, Tofu, Lettuce ]	My favorite dishes are the Three Delicacies Sizzling Rice Soup and  the Tofu Lettuce Wraps
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I am not lying when I say that I have NEVER had a dish I didn't like here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is never greasy, never oversauced and never overcooked
FOOD	[ seafood ]	 The seafood and veggies always have a really fresh taste
FOOD	[ O  ]	I seriously have no complaints at all
FOOD	[ O  ]	I miss you
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just an update to say they don't even have the #1 spot anymore as that goes pretty easily to Ichiban on park
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Still, better than most in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	We only ever go for their lunch special - so that's what this review is, I haven't yet gone here for dinner
FOOD	[ dishes ]	The dishes are a little hit/miss for authenticity
FOOD	[ Chicken, chicken, pork, spring rolls, egg rolls ]	The Imperial Chicken is really good (not breaded like someone else said, but it's great), the sweet and sour chicken is definitely a "miss," the mu shoo pork is great, although a tad greasy, the fried spring rolls are fantastic, the egg rolls are okay
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is FANTASTIC and the price is unbeatable for what you get
FOOD	[ O  ]	We never walk  away from lunch hungry
FOOD	[ O  ]	I suggest getting there a little early for lunch (they open at 11am) because it can get a little crowded
FOOD	[ mustard ]	Also, I love their spicy mustard - you have to try it!!!Fool me once, shame on you
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fool me twice, shame on me
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went there a second time because I couldn't remember if I liked the food or not (yes,it was THAT unremarkable)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Upon going there the second time, I knew there would not be a third
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ever
FOOD	[ O  ]	I know this is Madison, but c'mon, I've had more authentic Chinese food at Panda Express
FOOD	[ O  ]	What should have been an immediate tip-off was the fact that there weren't any chinese words on the menu
FOOD	[ Fugu ]	and that all the clientele was white (again, yes I know this is Madison, but this is compared to other Chinese restaurants like Fugu or Ichiban)
FOOD	[ dishes, fish, chicken, pork, beef ]	I don't actually remember the specific dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dry and flavorless
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was also slow
FOOD	[ glasses ]	They refilled our glasses only once, after we had asked for the check
FOOD	[ O  ]	I won't be going back
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is not delicious, but the service is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Often rumored to have the best Chinese food in the Madison area, this restaurant is a major disappointment
FOOD	[ tofu, vegetables, tofu ]	My spicy tofu and vegetables dish was not in the least spicy and the tofu was only fried and would have been better marinated
FOOD	[ O  ]	The entree my dining companion ordered was also sub-par
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was very quick and the food served very quickly, maybe too much so
FOOD	[ O  ]	Madison has great Southast Asian restaurants, but I definitely won't be eating more Chinese food  anywhere here
FOOD	[ potstickers, moo shu pork, cashew, chicken ]	Grilled potstickers, moo shu pork, cashew chicken
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum!!Yum!  Party of 7, everyone ordered their own dish and then shared with all
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	 Started with pot stickers and shrimp ragoon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Grilled pot stickers were really good, could have just eaten those and been happy
FOOD	[ Appetizers, dipping sauces ]	 Appetizers came with a variety of dipping sauces
FOOD	[ dishes, beef, almond, chicken, lamb ]	 Best dishes sampled were crispy orange beef, almond chicken and generals lamb
FOOD	[ Lamb, choice ]	 Lamb was way tender, excellent choice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service was prompt and friendly, great atmosphere
FOOD	[ mango, ice cream ]	 Ended meal with delicious mango ice cream
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Left happy and very full!I live on the east side of Madison and I always eat at the Imperial Gardens near E
FOOD	[ O  ]	Washington and this Imperial was a let down
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasn't as amazing as I hoped for
FOOD	[ starters ]	For starters, the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger
FOOD	[ chicken, rice soup, flavor ]	Our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down
FOOD	[ beef ]	My friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste
FOOD	[ pepper, steak, onions, meat ]	I had the pepper steak and I did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff was very kind but a little annoying
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every 10min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us
FOOD	[ conversation ]	We could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation
FOOD	[ O  ]	Imperial Garden Middleton will definitely be memorable but, for all the wrong reasons
FOOD	[ O  ]	Decent food, slightly more expensive than their competitors, and more legit varieties on their menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll give credit to Imperial Garden's decor as it is significantly more eye-pleasing than other Asian restaurants and the fact that they have a full bar
FOOD	[ peking duck ]	I give kudos to this place because they're the only Chinese restaurant in the area that offers peking duck, a true Chinese specialty
FOOD	[ seafood ]	Their seafood selection is also pretty upstanding and are cooked well
FOOD	[ dishes ]	I'm also a fan of their "banquet" specials, which is for when you go in groups and they offer you a selection of X many dishes to share for a set price per person (this is available for lunch and dinner I believe, though I've never been here for lunch)
FOOD	[ dishes ]	Aside from the aforementioned pros of Imperial Garden, the other dishes on their menu (if you order without doing the "banquet") is average-tasting at best and overpriced
FOOD	[ O  ]	Im rating this more on being American Chinese then true authentic Chinese
FOOD	[ O  ]	That being said it was very nice inside
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not too formal but definitely not a take-out joint
FOOD	[ soup ]	We got a cup of the Hot and Sour soup
FOOD	[ O  ]	Which is always my favorite
FOOD	[ Seafood, soup ]	To try something different we got the Seafood Hot and Sour soup also
FOOD	[ seafood, flavor, pork ]	Almost taste just like the regular Hot and Sour put of course more of a seafood flavor then pork
FOOD	[ O  ]	It only comes in a serving that serves 2-3
FOOD	[ cups ]	Which is a great value because the 3 of us easily got 2 cups each out of it
FOOD	[ Pork, chestnuts, onions, mushrooms, garlic, tomato sauce ]	The Fragrant Pork had chestnuts, green peppers, onions, mushrooms and carrots in a garlic tomato sauce, Said that it was spicy hot put I only got a tiny bit of kick
FOOD	[ O  ]	Put still good being sweet and garlicky
FOOD	[ Rice ]	The Three Delicacies Sizzling Rice dish caught me by surprise in a good way
FOOD	[ O  ]	Expecting it would come with that same bland and over salty white sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	But I couldn't stop tasting the sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was like no other white sauce I have tasted before
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitress poured the sauce for the dish right in front of you so it was "sizzling"
FOOD	[ rice, skillet ]	The rice was on the bottom of the skillet plate so it ended up getting crunchy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Adding a great texture to the dish
FOOD	[ shrimp, scallops, chicken ]	The shrimp, scallops and chicken in the dish were tender
FOOD	[ pea, chestnuts, mushrooms ]	Also in it were pea pods, water chestnuts, carrots and mushrooms
FOOD	[ cookie, cookie ]	Even the fortune cookie at the end was a better grade cookie then take-out places
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was helpful, attentive and friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	For Wisconsin, this is about the best you are going to get for Chinese Food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sorry, you live in Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	But the food is very good
FOOD	[ chicken, rice ]	 Huge servings, enormous shrimps, chicken that is tender, fresh rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't complain Cheeseheads, this is good as it gets for Chinese in Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum
FOOD	[ O  ]	Check out back of menu soups
FOOD	[ Lettuce ]	Very good!Lettuce wraps 3x better than PF Changs
FOOD	[ O  ]	If Yelp reviewers consider PF changs 3 stars, then this gets 5
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just to clear up for those who want authentic Chinese
FOOD	[ O  ]	Go to ICHIBAN NOW!!!How do you get voted best of for 31 years when what is served is awful? This is the worst Chinese food my entire family has had in years
FOOD	[ O  ]	We all ordered different things and none of us could eat our meals
FOOD	[ O  ]	That was $50 wasted
FOOD	[ flavor, flavor ]	There was no flavor, or the flavor there was did not match the dish
FOOD	[ beef, fried rice, flavor ]	How do you mess up beef fried rice? I can make it with more flavor
FOOD	[ beef, flavor ]	The Mongolian beef had a flavor but it was all wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you want to waste money and still be hungry, this is the place for you
FOOD	[ O  ]	How do places keep getting good reviews when they are so bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	I use to trust Yelp reviews but lately, I've been fooled by the reviews
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had fond memories of dining at the Imperial Garden
FOOD	[ O  ]	back in the 1990s, when I didn't really have access to more "exotic" and interesting foods
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been to this location twice within the past year or so - once for lunch with a coworker, and once for dinner with friends last night
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Huge establishment - impressively big
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Quick to be seated
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Server was friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Waters were refilled quickly
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Decent selection of bottled beers/drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Massive menu, but not really
FOOD	[ dishes ]	many identical dishes on the menu, with different protein options
FOOD	[ dishes, flavor ]	- Food/dishes very salty, but otherwise bland in flavor
FOOD	[ spice ]	No spice, no interesting flavors/tastes
FOOD	[ bass, bass ]	- Sea bass dish tasted extremely fishy; sea bass should be "clean" and non-fishy
FOOD	[ Duck, fatty, fatty ]	- Duck was very fatty - extremely fatty
FOOD	[ Red Pepper, Chicken, flavor, pasty, brown sauce ]	- Red Pepper Chicken ("very spicy") had zero flavor and was drowned in pasty brown sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Service became extremely slow/absent after we received our entrees
FOOD	[ O  ]	Took us 30+ minutes to get checks, pay, and leave - entrees arrived at 7:15pm, we left at 8:15pm
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm glad the four of us split entrees last night
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would've been really disappointed had I ordered something for myself
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's just
FOOD	[ O  ]	not very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Guessing this place caters to folks who want to eat adventurously without really doing so
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is sub-par; this place is resting on some large laurels
FOOD	[ Indian ]	I'd much prefer a flavorful Thai or Indian dish
FOOD	[ O  ]	Won't be back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best Chinese food in the area
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great service and calming atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	What a crushing experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	My son was in town and when he is here we like to visit and spoil ourselves to a splurge of a dinner outing
FOOD	[ O  ]	This particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur
FOOD	[ O  ]	SO on this stormy night we decided on Chinese and I had recommended we drive to Middleton for what I had heard to be the best around
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ok
FOOD	[ min ]	so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot
FOOD	[ O  ]	 ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area
FOOD	[ O  ]	After the immediate seating, WE were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	which turned out to be just right
FOOD	[ Appetizers ]	Appetizers were mediocre
FOOD	[ O  ]	nothing to remember
FOOD	[ O  ]	we had the app for two
FOOD	[ calamari ]	calamari was HORRIBLE  btw  I could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that
FOOD	[ O  ]	the following is my reason for writing
FOOD	[ Lobster ]	My forewarning is NOT TO TRUST in ordering the Lobster dish
FOOD	[ Lobster ]	I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation
FOOD	[ Ginger, garlic, butter, garlic ]	Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best
FOOD	[ lobster ]	More importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price
FOOD	[ O  ]	She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 pds or larger
FOOD	[ O  ]	So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering
FOOD	[ O  ]	I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2
FOOD	[ lobster ]	5 pd lobster entree
FOOD	[ lobster ]	What arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 pound creature to begin with
FOOD	[ lobster ]	It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape
FOOD	[ meat ]	The meat was still in shell
FOOD	[ O  ]	(and I mean IN SHELL)
FOOD	[ meat ]	 There was hardly any meat to be had
FOOD	[ meat ]	The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean
FOOD	[ lobster ]	There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	All in all an EXTREME disappointment
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	As the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will NEVER return
FOOD	[ O  ]	I cannot tolerate being misled by a server
FOOD	[ O  ]	We ended up tipping and not making a fuss
FOOD	[ O  ]	just another lesson learned
FOOD	[ O  ]	The storm raged on , I did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not a total loss I guess
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just stay away from places like this that lie for profit and have followings that end up being ill fated
FOOD	[ O  ]	Always consistently delicious! Classic preparations of Americanized Chinese
FOOD	[ cashew, chicken ]	The cashew chicken is great!I was in town visiting family and someone suggested IG
FOOD	[ O  ]	When I drove up to it, it brought back yummy memories
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's been years since I ate there
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am glad we went there for dinner
FOOD	[ chicken, beef, chicken, beef, beef, chow ]	We ate governors chicken, governors beef, sweet and sour chicken, peppered beef and beef chow fun
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everyone ate their plates! Service was slow that night but the food made up for it!There's a climactic scene in the movie Drive where the hero meets the badguy in a 'Chinese' restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a prop for the movie to sell the idea of foreign while these two real bad American dudes hash out their differences
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's rich and exotic and mysterious and
FOOD	[ O  ]	goddamn exciting
FOOD	[ O  ]	IG is a Chinese American restaurant in the burbs of burbs that serves burbanites, but man it had that feeling
FOOD	[ Peking Duck ]	The Russian friend and I went there on a Sunday night for their Peking Duck special
FOOD	[ appetizer, soup ]	We got that and some appetizer platter and some wonton soup and some cocktails
FOOD	[ Peking Duck ]	None of it was particularly memorable, and in fact the Peking Duck skin was *not* crispy, but the presentation was spot on
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's been so much streamlining of Asian restaurants that nice chairs and big booths with lots of room is uncommon
FOOD	[ O  ]	And on top of it I am a sucker for ethnic restaurants that have good servers that can connect with customers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Do you know how rare that is? Take advantage and talk it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Be polite and get good service
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't think Madison's foodies would give this place four stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	But I saw a bunch of other slant eyes here with me, and I imagined they were like me, wide eyed and happy to be here eating whatever this was
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd take my mom here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hands down the best Chinese food in Madison
FOOD	[ chicken, chow mein ]	The chicken chow mein has been a favorite since I was a child
FOOD	[ egg rolls, jasmine, chrysanthemum, tea ]	Try the egg rolls and the jasmine or chrysanthemum tea
FOOD	[ China ]	You really can never go wrong here! The decor is beautiful, and makes you almost feel like you could be in a restaurant in China
FOOD	[ O  ]	Imperial Garden has been getting progressively worse over the last few years
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious
FOOD	[ O  ]	The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low
FOOD	[ O  ]	But none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food
FOOD	[ O  ]	That is, if you get your food at all
FOOD	[ dishes ]	On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out
FOOD	[ O  ]	I now double-check all of my orders before leaving
FOOD	[ egg rolls ]	The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer
FOOD	[ flavor, syrup ]	They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup
FOOD	[ crab ]	The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon
FOOD	[ soup ]	I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not spicy enough, and far too sour
FOOD	[ ginger, beef ]	I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry
FOOD	[ ginger, flavor ]	There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet
FOOD	[ sugar ]	If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start
FOOD	[ black pepper, beef, punch, black pepper, balance, meat, vegetables ]	I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables
FOOD	[ beef, lo mein ]	On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein
FOOD	[ beef, vegetables ]	It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland
FOOD	[ rice ]	The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	I did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors
FOOD	[ O  ]	Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices
FOOD	[ Cafe ]	If you're looking for good Chinese in town, check out Hong Kong Cafe on Regent or Orient House on South Park instead
FOOD	[ O  ]	The short of the story is - we went here yesterday (Mother's Day) and were there 3 hours! Waited a full 2 hours for our food
FOOD	[ O  ]	So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste, then read on
FOOD	[ O  ]	For years I have drove by the Imperial Garden and referred to it as the "Chinese Restaurant Gas Station"
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't even know if they are connected or what, but you see them both as you turn the corner
FOOD	[ O  ]	We decided to go to this place for Mother's Day and check it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Talking to friends over the weekend, we were told it was pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	The building is nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was way nicer than I expected
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very large and nicely decorated
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not so cheesy like a lot of Chinese-American places in Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	The hostess greeted us very nicely and having reservations we were seated right away
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now - we were a larger than average group - table of 8 - but they clearly were set up for groups this big as they had large tables in the corner of the rooms with a spinning lazy susan in the middle that was perfect for us
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think we probably could have even gotten 9 or 10 people on this table
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitress was very nice too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Came right away and got us drinks and very friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is when things went down hill
FOOD	[ appetizers ]	We did order appetizers, which came out right away
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pot Stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Once our whole group arrived we all ordered regular items from their menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	Then we waited
FOOD	[ O  ]	Waited and waited and waited
FOOD	[ O  ]	Apparently so did everyone around us
FOOD	[ O  ]	For hours - over two to be exact
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitress did her best - kept coming by and telling us she was sorry, that the Kitchen was crazy and that we were next
FOOD	[ O  ]	Honestly we should have left - but it was hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Eventually the food came out
FOOD	[ O  ]	To their credit, I thought everything tasted pretty good
FOOD	[ shrimp, dishes ]	I got two different shrimp dishes
FOOD	[ flavor, peas, chestnuts ]	Decent flavor, cooked perfectly - the snap peas and water chestnuts were good
FOOD	[ Shrimp, chicken ]	Portion was decent on the Shrimp dinner and much larger on the chicken dinners that others in my group got
FOOD	[ O  ]	I agree with other reviews - its not the most adventurous food
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy at all
FOOD	[ Sesame, Chicken, Broccoli, broccoli ]	My sister-in-law was upset her Sesame Chicken with Broccoli came with one piece of broccoli
FOOD	[ broccoli ]	She complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, If the food wasn't pretty good - I would have given this place one star
FOOD	[ O  ]	I give our waitress credit for holding it together too
FOOD	[ O  ]	She offered free desert but we were about an hour late for getting to another place so had to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	Saddest thing is we heard that this has been an ongoing problem with the Kitchen
FOOD	[ dishes ]	Sounds like they don't fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things
FOOD	[ flavor, dishes ]	If they could correct this problem and add a bit more flavor into a few dishes, the place really could be ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	Try it on your own risk - but I would plan on spending several long hours while you wait for your food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Absolutely THE worst!  This place won "Best of Madison" for Chinese food for how many years??? The judge must have been completely stoned out of his mind! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Customer service:  Very poor
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The server never checked back until I went looking for her, wondering where our order was 50 minutes after ordering
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food finally arrived for our group of four--STONE COLD!  Plates themselves were hot but practically frostbite on the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Couldn't eat it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Manager came by, apologized and took 50% off the bill (!!!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Should have been 100% comped
FOOD	[ culinary ]	I'm one of those folks who normally overlooks a lot and actually hates to complain, but this culinary travesty really needed to be reported
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If this place previously had great food and service, then as of 2014 they've completely lost their "mojo"
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is our go-to Chinese restaurant in the Madison area
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Hands down, it's the best Chinese I've found so far
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'd give it 5 stars if the prices were more reasonable and the dine-in environment was better
FOOD	[ O  ]	Like I said, the food is superb
FOOD	[ Cashew, Chicken ]	 My usual dish is Cashew Chicken
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's hard to deviate from that when it's sooooo good
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 Other dishes are excellent as well
FOOD	[ meat ]	 What I like about Imperial is that the meat quality is good
FOOD	[ beef ]	 The beef is tasty and tender - not tough or "questionable"
FOOD	[ chicken, chicken ]	 The chicken is good as well - not some of the gray chicken-like material found at lesser establishments
FOOD	[ O  ]	We don't dine in often or at all
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's a little more formal than I prefer, and the experience can take a while
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Just not my preference
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I keep their number in my phone and call ahead for carry-out
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That's the way to go here, imho
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their location is very convenient for those of us that work in town and live in the western 'burbs
FOOD	[ cashew, chicken ]	 The portions they give out are very fair - my cashew chicken typically leaves me with a nice lunch for work the next day
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're looking for top-quality Chinese food, I highly recommend getting take-out here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you don't mind a more formal setting and have the time, go ahead and dine in
FOOD	[ Margaritas ]	Great Margaritas
FOOD	[ mexican ]	But it's hard to review a mexican restaurant that's as good as the next
FOOD	[ mexican ]	I still wish there was a TRULY good mexican restaurant in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Still waiting
FOOD	[ O  ]	And don't come tell me 
FOOD	[ O  ]	um
FOOD	[ O  ]	the one on Park
FOOD	[ O  ]	what's that name???
FOOD	[ O  ]	La Hacienda
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd rather poke my eye out or eat at La Bambas
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	Ok Mexican like everywhere else
FOOD	[ cover, tex-mex ]	I completely agree with the previous reviewer, "when is the authentic one coming to this town?" The menu cover page says it's authentic, but the men items themselves looked little more tex-mex ish
FOOD	[ fajita, chicken ]	I had a fajita plate while my friend had a chicken dish (I forgot what it was called)
FOOD	[ fajita, hot plate ]	My fajita arrived on a sizzling hot plate (that's takes care of the "fun part" regardless of the quality), and it was pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	The portion was huge, so I had to take ha;f of my plate to go, and the take out became the perfect left-over dinner next day
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	Mi Cocina is my favorite Mexican-style restaurant in the Madison area
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have never come away unimpressed with either the food or the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I can't really speak to authenticity since I wouldn't really know it if I saw it, but for what they do Mi Cocina does it well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All I do know is that I have gotten my favorites here over and over without ever having any problems
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The staff is always friendly and fast which sets the place apart from several other area restaurants of the genre
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If only for consistency I would rate Mi Cocina a three, and with never having a bad meal I definitely would go with a high 3
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 - 4 stars
FOOD	[ tacos, cream ]	Last time I had the fried tilapia tacos, and I especially enjoyed the spicy cream-based sauce that was served on the side
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was perfectly seasoned for my taste, though it was a bit hot for my mother
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The tilapia was lightly fried and was still tender
FOOD	[ refried beans, spice, tacos ]	 The accompanying refried beans were decent, and served to allow for the spice from the tacos to dissipate
FOOD	[ tacos ]	 I still put the blackened tilapia tacos at Tex Tubbs at the top of my favorites list, but these easily jumped to the #2 position
FOOD	[ enchiladas, spinach ]	 On previous trips I've gotten flautas, which were perfectly fried and not too crispy, and the enchiladas sonora, which comes with an excellent spinach and a creamy sauce
FOOD	[ cheese, mushroom, fajitas ]	 I also really enjoy the cheese and mushroom quesidilla and the fajitas
FOOD	[ chicken, breast ]	 My sister, who is lactose-intolerant, had found the menu a bit dairy-laden, but she did end up finding a chicken breast entree that is now her favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The prices are quite reasonable and given the amount of food always a good deal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Mi Cocina probably won't ever be held up as a paragon of the style, but it has always been reliable and enjoyable and for that I'll keep coming back
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is decent, the service is better than your average Madison restaurant and the bathrooms were clean
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is a bit out of our way but it is consistent enough to warrant more visits
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food - especially if you're in a hurry
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're in Brookfield try the Mi Cocina on Bluemound - I believe owned by the same people but the food is bette
FOOD	[ beer, Mexican ]	rAfter a wonderful day spent sitting down at the Memorial Union, drinking beer and reading through the Sunday newspaper, hunger got the better part of us, and Mexican food sounded yummy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So, our small group made our way back toward the Middleton and decided to take a short walk over to Mi Cocina
FOOD	[ O  ]	We arrived at around 6:00pm on a Sunday and were promptly seated
FOOD	[ chips, salsa ]	 The waiter brought us chips and salsa immediately, and then took our drink orders
FOOD	[ sodas, cheese, dip ]	 Within a few minutes, our sodas arrived, along with a cheese dip
FOOD	[ salsa, cheese, dip, salsa ]	We quickly scarfed down the salsa and cheese dip; the salsa was initially mild but then had a nice little kick to it at the end
FOOD	[ chips, chip ]	 The chips were a thicker cut chip; they weren't the slightest bit greasy
FOOD	[ cheese ]	 The queso was excellent - nice and hearty, white cheese, delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	We ordered our entrees and within minutes our food was available
FOOD	[ chicken, burritos, beef ]	 There was a slight mix-up with my order - I had requested chicken burritos but received beef
FOOD	[ beef, burritos, potato ]	 No big deal; the beef burritos were decent - some chunks of potato were an interesting touch
FOOD	[ chicken, burrito, chicken, enchilada, tamale ]	My dining partner ordered a sampler plate, which came with a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a tamale
FOOD	[ chicken, beef ]	 It was good as well; the chicken was far better than the ground beef
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was beyond excellent - very fast, very attentive, and as such, we left a nice tip
FOOD	[ margaritas ]	 Only complaints?  A tad pricey - our meal was $26 without any beers/margaritas, and there were a ton of kids in there, which was a bit distracting
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All in all a decent experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	It started out as an excellent place to go then they changed the menu, then they changed the menu again! The food changed names and the pricing increased but essentially it remained the same
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are now at the point where they are charging a little much for the food they are serving
FOOD	[ O  ]	I still go here because of convenience and lightning fast service
FOOD	[ O  ]	I noticed a new manager walking over the servers shoulders seemed to make the staff feeling like they were on pins and needles
FOOD	[ O  ]	Kids eat free on Sundays so keep that in mind!Kids eat free on Sunday!Ate here once with a buy one, get one coupon
FOOD	[ O  ]	I won't be heading back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Go to Los Gemelos off of State St instead
FOOD	[ taco ]	I love their taco loco
FOOD	[ fajita, taco salad ]	It's a mouthwatering fajita/taco salad concoction that I
FOOD	[ O  ]	can't get enough of and
FOOD	[ O  ]	can't finish
FOOD	[ dishes, taco ]	I have tried a few other dishes and nothing ranks near the crazy taco
FOOD	[ chips, salsa ]	 Warm, thick chips and a mild salsa are served bountifully
FOOD	[ chips ]	The chips aren't greasy and are not heavily salted which makes me happy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like to add my own anyway
FOOD	[ guacamole ]	They have three versions of guacamole
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yesterday we tried the most basic which was delicious and simple
FOOD	[ appetizer, cheese, chorizo ]	We also tried an appetizer with cheese and chorizo
FOOD	[ dip ]	It was good, but quickly coagulated which resulted in an undip-able dip
FOOD	[ O  ]	MARGARITA ALERT- their house margarita
FOOD	[ O  ]	not a traditional margarita
FOOD	[ O  ]	In my opinion, it tasted like watered down orange soda
FOOD	[ color, peach, color ]	And the color is a light peach color
FOOD	[ lime ]	If you want a classic, lime margarita I have yet to find one I love here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm not your typical margarita drinker
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The aftermath of too much sweet margarita mix and I do not get along
FOOD	[ margaritas ]	 I admit,  I'm kind of picky about margaritas, but these, these should have a warning when ordering
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	Good authentic Mexican, a lot of menu options, great service, nice quite atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really enjoyed my dinner here
FOOD	[ fajita, beef, chicken, shrimp, onions, scallions, tomato ]	I had a fantastic fajita platter, which included beef, chicken, shrimp, and the requisite peppers and onions, but also whole scallions and tomato wedges
FOOD	[ guacamole ]	Delicious! The guacamole was decent, though a little bland
FOOD	[ mole ]	And my husband's mole sauce was just OK
FOOD	[ salsa ]	But I really liked the spicy salsa they brought to the table when I requested it
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was pretty great; there was a whole team of servers that were constantly checking up on us to make sure we were doing OK
FOOD	[ salsa ]	Every time we had a special request (see: the spicy salsa), they were right on top of it
FOOD	[ margaritas, strawberry, margaritas ]	But what I REALLY liked was the margaritas; our table had a pitcher of blended strawberry margaritas, and they were absolutely perfect
FOOD	[ ice, strawberry, tequila, flavor ]	Blended just right with no big chunks of ice; perfectly balanced strawberry and tequila flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	I could have consumed that whole pitcher by myself without even putting in too much effort
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum!So, I've enjoyed Mi Cocina before
FOOD	[ O  ]	but I think my tastes have matured
FOOD	[ salsa, taco, chimichanga, ketchup, bbq, mixture ]	 The salsa was good, but the sauce inside of my taco and chimichanga was a strange ketchup/bbq tasting mixture
FOOD	[ Beans, rice ]	 Beans were ok, rice, not so much
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I probably won't be back
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Sorry Mi Cocina
FOOD	[ O  ]	I joined a few coworkers for lunch here today
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've not been a huge fan of Mi Cocina, so I hoped the new location and fresh look would've improved the experience
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	It's still just barely passable as Mexican food
FOOD	[ sauces, cheese ]	 Most entrees appear to be drowning in sauces, cheese, and other gooey/greasy stuff
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 The salsas are extremely watery and lacking in flavor
FOOD	[ guacamole, pasty ]	 The guacamole (not the tableside-made) is bland and pasty
FOOD	[ chicken, salad, bowl, lettuce, chicken, breast, cucumber, guacamole ]	I ordered a pollo ensalada (chicken salad), which arrived as a bowl of super watery iceburg lettuce, a slab of seared chicken breast, 4 small slices of cucumber, a spoonful of pico de gallo, and a huge glob of guacamole (which I scraped off and set aside)
FOOD	[ salad, soup, bowl ]	The salad was ok, but as I neared the end, I literally had what looked like a small soup bowl's worth of water resting in the bottom
FOOD	[ cheese, sauces, sauces, taco, cheese ]	My coworker's entrees were drenched in various cheese sauces/red sauces; the taco combo was blanketed in cheese
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They loved it, but my guts would've been complaining for days
FOOD	[ O  ]	So, enjoy the new location and ambiance - just don't expect better food
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	 Those who've had real Mexican food will not enjoy this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cocina Real/Mi Cocina = FAIL
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food = 2 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service = 3 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value = 2 stars
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	MISC = 3 starsThis is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison - and I think it is the best one in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	Here's what I like:
FOOD	[ Guacamole ]	The House Guacamole - Heaven! I always order this, and the last time, we had a table side preparation, a clear demonstration on how fresh the food is here - another thing that I love about this place - the abundance of fresh food
FOOD	[ O  ]	In all its simplicity, it's perfect
FOOD	[ salsa, Mexican, salsa ]	The salsa - I've disappointed all over Madison with other Mexican restaurant's salsa, and even for that matter, all over the Midwest and parts of California
FOOD	[ salsa ]	I've had the best salsa here - again very simple, but very delicious - and isn't that what matters? Food should be delicious, especially food at any restaurant
FOOD	[ chips ]	The chips - so good, so delicious
FOOD	[ chips ]	Yes, seems so silly to rate the free chips, but again another sign that this restaurant cares about how food tastes and only serves the best of ingredients and food
FOOD	[ vegetables, dishes ]	As mentioned above, the abundance of fresh ingredients, especially fresh vegetables, in all dishes
FOOD	[ O  ]	As for the other entrees, I've never been disappointed
FOOD	[ all good ]	Take your pick - they're all good
FOOD	[ O  ]	This restaurant has actually moved, and is no longer located on University Ave
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are now on Allen Bvld
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think they have settled in to their new place, and service is back on par
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bon Appetit!Sooo
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ok
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	I live Mexican food
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	I grew up in Southern California so my standards for Mexican food are high
FOOD	[ O  ]	That being said I assume most places are gonna be bad so that if they are good I'm quite happy
FOOD	[ O  ]	And if they aren't well
FOOD	[ O  ]	That's what I expected
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place made me happy and quite upset at the same time
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll start at the beginning
FOOD	[ chips ]	The chips
FOOD	[ O  ]	Kinda bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	They were super dry and weird
FOOD	[ salt ]	Super weird consistency and zero salt
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our second basket was better, but still lacking
FOOD	[ salsa ]	The salsa was ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not amazing but not bad
FOOD	[ Margaritas ]	Margaritas were good and seemed to be on the strong side which no one should complain about
FOOD	[ O  ]	ever
FOOD	[ burrito ]	My burrito was actually alright
FOOD	[ carnitas, burrito ]	I had the carnitas burrito and it was good
FOOD	[ O  ]	It needed a bit of spicing up so it asked for hot sauce and another margarita when the waiter checked back
FOOD	[ O  ]	He said no problem
FOOD	[ min ]	A few min pass and he brings my margarita and says he'll be right bam with the hot sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm eating very slowly because I want that hot sauce
FOOD	[ min ]	It's now been probably 10 min since my margarita came
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't like eating slow
FOOD	[ O  ]	And I finally say screw it and finish eating
FOOD	[ O  ]	He comes and takes my plate away
FOOD	[ O  ]	And then he brings me the hot sauce to the table
FOOD	[ O  ]	I mean really?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bottom line, Drinks: Yay! Food: Ehh
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service: Booooo!I hate myself for reviewing Dominos, but I have to give props to this location for their awesome service and incredible speed
FOOD	[ O  ]	A++++ service - friendly, helpful, and enjoyable
FOOD	[ pizza ]	 Definitely not what you'd expect from a carryout chain pizza place
FOOD	[ pizza, pizza ]	The "all new" pizza that the commercials boast about tastes exactly like the "old" pizza to me
FOOD	[ garlic, flavor, pie ]	 Perhaps there's a bit more garlic flavor to the crust, but otherwise seems to be the same 'ole Dominos pie
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pricey, too
FOOD	[ chocolate ]	A 14" Brooklyn with 3 toppings and a pair of chocolate lava cakes was $25
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ouch!!! Same deal from Papa Johns would've cost $15
FOOD	[ pizza ]	I usually eat Dominos pizza about once every 2 years
FOOD	[ pizza ]	Even with the "all new" pizza, I don't think I'll be sampling with any more frequency
FOOD	[ O  ]	Summary:
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service = 5 stars (awesome folks working here, seriously!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food = 2 stars (despite being "all new" it still tastes the same to me)
FOOD	[ pizza ]	Value = 1 stars (extremely pricey for take-out pizza)
FOOD	[ china, buffet, buffet ]	Misc = 5 stars (online ordering is the best system ever)The china wok buffet is the best Chinese buffet I've ever been too! I only give it a 4 instead of a 5 because if i find something better(very unlikely) i won't be able to rate it as such
FOOD	[ buffet ]	This buffet has everything you could want from Chinese food
FOOD	[ chicken, pork, seafood ]	It has a delicious array of chicken's, pork, and seafood
FOOD	[ chicken, crab, cheese, shrimp, salmon ]	My personal fav's are the Tso's, peppered chicken, crab cheese bake, deep fried shrimp, and the baked salmon
FOOD	[ crab, egg rolls, soup ]	Their crab Rangoon, egg rolls, and soup are fair
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finally their desert
FOOD	[ buffets, ice cream ]	Unlike most Chinese buffets I've been to this one buckets of ice cream
FOOD	[ Mint, Chocolate chip, strawberry, butter, pecan, birthday cake ]	You serve yourself but you get a decent assortment of Mint Chocolate chip, strawberry, butter pecan, and birthday cake
FOOD	[ O  ]	If your ever in the mood to over indulge on food at a really good price
FOOD	[ O  ]	I definitely recommend going here
FOOD	[ buffets ]	I typically hate and do not recommend Chinese buffets, but this is totally the exception
FOOD	[ buffet ]	I have been going to this buffet for a few years now, and it is great every time
FOOD	[ buffet ]	 They don't overstock the buffet, so they keep the items fresh all the time
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 From the soups, to apps to the main dishes, is very good food
FOOD	[ sushi, buffet ]	 Remember, its Chinese, so stay away from the sushi, its not up to par with the rest of the buffet
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	 Finally, there is ice cream kind of hidden in the back
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Put a scoop or two on top of a hot doughunt or two and you will finish in heaven
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went to this place at 7pm
FOOD	[ O  ]	And most of the food was cold or warm some hot fresh food
FOOD	[ O  ]	That was good but not for 10
FOOD	[ O  ]	75
FOOD	[ ice ]	 The only thing was great was the ice cram
FOOD	[ O  ]	Went there on Saturday night to get some food to go
FOOD	[ Buffets ]	On of the worst Chinese Buffets I've seen
FOOD	[ O  ]	Half of the trays were empty and other half were almost empty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very little selection
FOOD	[ O  ]	The worst pay is the take out prices: $10
FOOD	[ O  ]	50 to get a to go box(should be under 2lb) and 40 cents for every ounce after, WTF is that!!! So we just went somewhere else that night and didn't dine there at all
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bottom line: EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE
FOOD	[ choice ]	Not good, not BAD, this place is a fine choice if you're looking for totally mediocre but plentiful food
FOOD	[ O  ]	That being said, I would not recommend the place to friends
FOOD	[ O  ]	this place is great for what it is
FOOD	[ rush ]	 i've never been disappointed - even after the lunch rush is over the food is kept fresh and rotated
FOOD	[ buffets ]	 i can't speak for dinner, but lunch is as good as chinese buffets get in the madison/middleton locale
FOOD	[ O  ]	 jade garden is good if they are busy, but they let the food go to pot when they slow down a little
FOOD	[ O  ]	I live close by and stop in periodically and have not had any issues with food or service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have left full and happy every time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hot food
FOOD	[ sushi ]	all the sushi you can eat!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Keep up the good work!This place is average
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lots of food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Speedy staff
FOOD	[ buffet ]	It's a casual buffet
FOOD	[ buffet ]	Great for business lunchesSome of the food on the buffet is quite good
FOOD	[ pork, barbecue, pork ]	The Szechwan pork and barbecue pork stand out in my recollection
FOOD	[ fried rice, peas ]	The fried rice is memorable for its blandness and frozen peas and carrots
FOOD	[ Cabbage, egg rolls ]	Cabbage was apparently the only ingredient that they could find to stuff their egg rolls with
FOOD	[ O  ]	This gets lows ratings for staff and service
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were barely acknowledged upon entrance and completely ignored when attempting to pay
FOOD	[ O  ]	One drink refill arrived at all, and even then it was about 7 minutes later than desired
FOOD	[ O  ]	The manager chatted quite loudly on his phone while we and several others tried to settle our bills
FOOD	[ O  ]	He grunted in lieu of speaking and made his best effort to lob the receipts over the counter to avoid ever being within 6 inches of his customers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not sure why I keep deciding to come back here
FOOD	[ Rice, rock, flavor, buffet ]	Rice is rock hard and has no flavor, along with most of the other food on the half-empty buffet trays
FOOD	[ O  ]	$10
FOOD	[ O  ]	50 for a plate of stale food and a drink that they forget to refill? No thanks
FOOD	[ O  ]	A completely unexpected find
FOOD	[ cafe ]	While on a trip to Madison we wandered into this cafe after checking out the local grocery across the street (it's an odd obsession of ours to check out grocery stores when in a new town)
FOOD	[ sandwich, bread, glass ]	When you're starving and pop into the first place you see, you hope for a sandwich with no mold on the bread and a halfway clean glass for your soda
FOOD	[ O  ]	This was light years beyond that
FOOD	[ salad ]	I had the special salad of the day
FOOD	[ mixture, greens, celery, blue cheese ]	It was delicious, a mixture of greens with just a sprinkling of crunchy celery, and full of huge chunks of the tastiest creamy blue cheese I've had in a very long time
FOOD	[ soup ]	My lunch companion had soup which she declared to also be delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Decor was a tad dark, and since we were there for a late lunch we were the only ones not sitting alone playing with laptops
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, the tchotkes and lending library helped create a friendly neighborhood hangout feel
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you need a tasty breakfast for cheap, saunter in here(well, the sauntering might cause some dirty looks--it's pretty low key)
FOOD	[ glass, dishes ]	This place has tasty treats behind the glass case, and a variety of breakfast dishes on their menu
FOOD	[ bread, Coffee ]	I love the vast bread choices, and the fact that they serve Alterra Coffee(our fave)
FOOD	[ O  ]	A bit of interesting art to view, and a nice sunny place to sit outside, if you choose
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yay for Sundays
FOOD	[ Cafe, scones ]	I had stopped in to the Prairie Cafe & Bakery several times since it opened to buy scones for the office, and I hadn't really given it much thought beyond this purpose
FOOD	[ scones ]	 I really liked the scones, but I didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time I had stopped the place seemed empty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 AM and I was the first person through the door
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So this weekend, based on Chris & Kelly's recommendations, I stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I found out that all this time I was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere
FOOD	[ scones ]	 I walked up and ordered the breakfast special - I was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The price was OK, not under $6 but not more than I would have expected anywhere else
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and I was really impressed by the decor
FOOD	[ coffee, coffee ]	 I got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - I love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but I tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 The coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I savored it while I read a magazine and waited on my breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	After a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 The wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but I was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The special, which was basically a Denver scrambler, was completely satisfying, filling but not heavy
FOOD	[ bread ]	 The wheat toast was much better than the average bread you get with breakfast, quite possibly highlight of the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was pleasantly surprised by the whole breakfast experience here
FOOD	[ Cafe ]	 I wasn't planning on finding such a great place for breakfast in the Prairie Cafe
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Maybe one of these days I'll get a chance to try lunch here too
FOOD	[ Cafe ]	I have visited Prairie Cafe several times and love it
FOOD	[ egg, dishes, sandwiches ]	The breakfast/lunch menu is varies from great egg dishes to tasty sandwiches and salads
FOOD	[ O  ]	Vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike will find somthing satisfying
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Good selection of in-house, serve-yourself coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	I tried the "Health Shake," --sort of a cross between a shake and a smoothie
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very tasty and a perfect breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very comfortable atmosphere with free wireless
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seems to attract a "usual" crowd
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall a very positive experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been back here several times since my first review, and have been continually impressed with Prairie
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is always spot on and the atmosphere is so comfortable
FOOD	[ cafe, sandwiches, gourmet, tuna, egg ]	The cafe sandwiches take one step towards gourmet--the tuna and egg salads are made in-house with a little twist from the same old
FOOD	[ choice, bean, corn salad ]	All are served with a choice of side; I favor the black bean and corn salad
FOOD	[ scrambled eggs, spinach, pesto ]	Breakfast is no exception to Prairie's perfection--my scrambled eggs with spinach and pesto were fresh and filling
FOOD	[ fruit, smoothies, coffee ]	And it's hard to go wrong with any of the real fruit smoothies or coffee drinks
FOOD	[ cafe ]	Prairie is exactly the way a cafe should be
FOOD	[ cafe ]	I've only been here two or three times and I agree that this little cafe is a well kept secret
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is good and healthy, the fireplace cozy, and the original art on the walls is a nice touch
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great place to meet a friend for lunch
FOOD	[ chai, latte ]	Haven't tried breakfast or bakery but the chai latte was warm and tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	They also have some vegetarian choices
FOOD	[ lobster, bisque, soup ]	About a year ago we went and the lobster bisque was really salty, but I wouldn't hesitate to order soup from them again
FOOD	[ O  ]	I picked up the fabulous Arts Commission calendar there last year and this year
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just found out they have free Wi-Fi
FOOD	[ O  ]	Check their hours before you go and bring cash or check, no cc
FOOD	[ O  ]	I desperately needed some lunch and came on this gem
FOOD	[ Almond, Chicken, Salad, sandwich, corn, bean, salad ]	I had the Almond Chicken Salad sandwich on a fresh 7-grain bagette with corn & bean salad
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	The sandwich was amazing
FOOD	[ salad ]	I didn't really care for the salad, but that didn't taint my experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good prices
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 They serve Alterra coffee - awesome!  My only complaint is that they don't accept credit cards
FOOD	[ O  ]	A solid little place for breakfast and lunch - my experiences have been good, but not "outstanding" - it's pretty difficult to have a bad breakfast (although Perkins seems to have mastered the art of the worst breakfast), so I'm going with 3-stars: A-OK
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place gets a little busy on weekends; I've been there both during the week and on weekends
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's largely a "self-service" type place, which is fine by me
FOOD	[ coffee, condiments ]	 You place your order at the main counter, get your own coffee and condiments, find a table and wait for the food to arrive
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 When you're done eating, you clear your own table, take the dishes to the "dish basket" and head on your merry way
FOOD	[ O  ]	The pancakes aren't anything spectacular - just your regular "mix made" pancakes
FOOD	[ color ]	 They're cooked well, with nice color, and are "plate size" so one or two should be plenty for most folks
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They're not obscenely thick; in fact, they're a bit on the thin side, come to think of it
FOOD	[ sandwich, egg, choice, meat, cheese, muffin ]	Breakfast sandwich is decent - an egg, your choice of meat, some cheese, and served on a muffin
FOOD	[ eggs, tomatoes, onion, ham, cheese, choice ]	I've also had the Wright Breakfast and today, I had the special, which was two eggs, scrambled with tomatoes, peppers, onion, ham, cheese and a choice of toast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Again - it was good, but not "out of this world great
FOOD	[ coffee ]	They're currently serving Alterra-brand coffee; another review references Ancora, but it looks like they've switched to Alterra
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 It's good coffee, nonetheless
FOOD	[ O  ]	Staff keeps largely to themselves, which is nice - no one bothers you throughout the meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They don't take credit/debit cards - it's cash or check only
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There's a fair amount of seating indoors and a few metal tables and chairs outside for when the weather is nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There tends to be a lot of families that meet here on the weekends, so if kids aren't your thing, steer clear on Saturday and Sunday
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I had the joy of listening to two screaming kids during my entire meal this morning - the parents were oblivious
FOOD	[ O  ]	My biggest gripe?  Price
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 My breakfast this morning ("special" plus two pancakes plus coffee) cost $14
FOOD	[ O  ]	10
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That's a little steep for standard breakfast fare
FOOD	[ O  ]	Breakfast is served all-day long on Saturday and Sunday; during the week it's served until 11am, at which point it's lunch only until closing time (around 3pm, I believe)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I happened upon this charming restaurant and loved the simple and warm feel of the place
FOOD	[ egg, quiche ]	I had visions of an egg breakfast but it was too late in the day, so the wait person suggested the quiche which did not disappoint
FOOD	[ Cafe ]	 I was on the road so stopping at the Prairie Cafe was just the right thing to do
FOOD	[ coffee ]	The coffee was delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food was good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It wasn't the best breakfast I've ever had but it was solid
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Cash only
FOOD	[ O  ]	Marvelous little breakfast spot
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband and I spent the weekend in Middleton and came here twice because it was so good! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really enjoyed the ambience, ordering at the register and having our food come out to the table
FOOD	[ coffee, oatmeal, sandwich ]	The fair-trade coffee was outstanding, as were the oatmeal with berries and breakfast sandwich
FOOD	[ chocolate, croissant, buttery, chocolate, mocha ]	I was particularly blown away by the chocolate croissant, which I couldn't imagine could trump my favorite at Bennison's in Evanston IL but it was deliciously buttery, flakey and had the best chocolate filling I've ever had in pain chocolat! My husband swore that his mocha was the best he's had in his life
FOOD	[ scone ]	Kind of makes us want to move out here!Just got back from having breakfast with the girls! It rocked! Excellent breakfast! Two of us had the scramble special & one had a scone - to die for! Great atmosphere! Easy place to meet family & friends and/or work! I'll be going back very soon! :)I used to love this place - I came here once every week or two for breakfast and to sit and write for an hour or two (I'm a grad student working on my thesis)
FOOD	[ eggs, bacon, coffee, coffee ]	The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude
FOOD	[ O  ]	until today
FOOD	[ O  ]	Today is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am
FOOD	[ O  ]	I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table
FOOD	[ O  ]	I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before
FOOD	[ O  ]	He asked if I was aware of their "new policy" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded
FOOD	[ sugar ]	(No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said
FOOD	[ O  ]	) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Whatever
FOOD	[ O  ]	His point was obvious
FOOD	[ O  ]	I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate
FOOD	[ O  ]	He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out
FOOD	[ O  ]	I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, "That's exactly how we feel
FOOD	[ O  ]	" I was shocked, and still am
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business
FOOD	[ O  ]	And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors
FOOD	[ O  ]	If the food was exceptional I might try to swallow my pride, but it's really nothing special
FOOD	[ coffee ]	There are several other breakfast/coffee shops in the area (including a Starbucks across the road) and I will be patronizing them instead from now on
FOOD	[ tuna salad ]	My food was surprisingly good but the tuna salad had some odd ingredients
FOOD	[ Cafe, cafe ]	Read my full review!Prarie Cafe & Bakery exists in one of those cafe/restaurant purgatories in which nothing is offensive and nothing is remarkable
FOOD	[ brunch ]	The food is good but there are better brunch places in Madison
FOOD	[ cafe, coffee ]	 It has a cozy feel but I can't tell if they want to be a cafe/coffee shop or a restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Cash Only!  
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not running back but will probably return at some point
FOOD	[ O  ]	I must say I rather like this place, even though I wish they took credit cards
FOOD	[ tea ]	Great pastries and tea, as well as good veggie breakfast options
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not the fastest service but worth the wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm soo confused
FOOD	[ coffee, blend ]	Am I in a post office, sit down restaurant, or casual coffee shop? If you were going for the blend of all three, then heck, I guess you nailed it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seriously
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are postal boxes in this joint
FOOD	[ coffee ]	The best things I can say about this was that the coffee was hot
FOOD	[ burrito ]	The breakfast burrito I had was "meh"
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing great, nothing terrible
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was warm but took fooooooooorrrr-eeeeeeev-errrrrrrrrrr
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was just okay
FOOD	[ O  ]	They don't accept plastic
FOOD	[ coffee ]	I can understand your local dive bar or small coffee shop not wanting to accept plastic, but for what (I think) they are trying to do here, I would expect them to accept cards
FOOD	[ O  ]	But they don't
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you think about it, it almost seems like they are going back to the good ol' days of the general store
FOOD	[ O  ]	Middleton's one-stop shop
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 You can check your postal box, get your coffee, get your paper, and buy random goods
FOOD	[ O  ]	Besides a hitching post for your horse, what more could you need?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Take it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Leave it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Whatever
FOOD	[ breads ]	From scratch pastries, breads, breakfast, lunch, dinner options
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Cozy coffee shop atmosphere, fireplace, plenty of tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cash only
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pay at front and they will bring the food out to you
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Free refills on coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	Never dissapointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been here at least 8 or 9 times since the August 2010 review; time for an update
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pros:
FOOD	[ breakfast food ]	+ Solid breakfast food, especially the special scrambles
FOOD	[ O  ]	Can't miss
FOOD	[ breads ]	+ Great breads - I've tried nearly all of them and they're excellent
FOOD	[ coffee ]	+ Altera coffee 
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Friendly staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Bakery items (cookies/pastries) are superb
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cons:
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Cash only
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Slightly expensive
FOOD	[ O  ]	- When busy, seating is hard to come by; small space
FOOD	[ O  ]	No complaints with the food - it's always been high quality
FOOD	[ flavor ]	We were there today as part of a team outing, and several folks commented about the pancakes - they are truly great, with a good sear, excellent flavor, and perfect texture
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had the scramble, and it was as good as always
FOOD	[ O  ]	I ate here twice this week
FOOD	[ brunch ]	The first time with 5 others for a lunch meeting; the second time with my wife & daughter for a light brunch
FOOD	[ iced coffee ]	Both days were warm and muggy so I started with an iced coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	Well done
FOOD	[ O  ]	Can't go wrong with Alterra
FOOD	[ BLT, bacon, cheddar ]	For my work lunch I ordered the CBLT, a nicely toasted BLT with a thick cut of bacon and some cheddar melted in
FOOD	[ lettuce, tomato, fruit ]	The lettuce and tomato are fresh, as is the "fresh fruit" on the side
FOOD	[ egg, sandwich, ham ]	Today, my wife had an egg sandwich with ham
FOOD	[ omelette, bread, BLT ]	It was huge, like an omelette on the same toasted bread as my BLT a few days before
FOOD	[ yogurt, parfait, fruit, granola ]	The yogurt parfait my daughter ordered had fresh fruit and crunchy granola
FOOD	[ O  ]	The power was out while we were there today, but the staff worked hard to serve everything on the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	Kudos to them all and to this great little place in Middleton
FOOD	[ O  ]	As always excellent, locally sourced food
FOOD	[ eggs, bacon, pancake ]	Such a cute place!! I was there for breakfast, and had eggs, bacon, homefries, toast and a pancake
FOOD	[ Eggs ]	I like variety, what can I say?? Eggs were good
FOOD	[ Bacon ]	Bacon and toast ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	Homefries were kinda greasy, but tasted awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	Totally looked like they would be gross, but were delicious
FOOD	[ Pancake ]	Pancake is where it's at
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seriously
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, I believe they make their own pastries
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Several coffee options, too
FOOD	[ O  ]	The outside seating is so cute, too
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was there on a weekday morning, so there wasn't a whole lot going on, but it was still fun to sit outside on a perfect day, and watch the traffic and people go by
FOOD	[ Coffee, corned beef ]	Coffee was good, corned beef hash was OK but not great
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was very friendly and prompt
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice area outside to enjoy the sunshine while having breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great Place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just good quality breakfast and lunch foods
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Pleasant atmosphere, great coffee, hit or miss bakery
FOOD	[ coffee, Cafe ]	When I venture to Middleton to catch up with friends over a cup of coffee, I often end up at the Prairie Cafe & Bakery
FOOD	[ Coffee ]	 It's a short bike ride from the 53597 and the Alterra Coffee (or is it Colectivo now, I'm so confused) they serve beats the pants off of what you can get from the neighboring Starbucks
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wish the outdoors seating area took advantage of the nearby Pheasant Branch Conservancy
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 Sipping coffee and watching the locals pick-up their dry-cleaning just isn't the vibe I'm looking for I guess
FOOD	[ coffee ]	I can't vouch for the breakfast or lunch selections, since I'm just a coffee and baked goods sort of guy
FOOD	[ scones, muffins ]	 As for baked goods, I've had some excellent scones and muffins at Prairie
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Like scream it from the rooftop great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But not every time
FOOD	[ coffee, scone, scone ]	 Just when I'm ready to proclaim Prairie my go to coffee and a scone hangout, I get a scone that's as dry as Atacama Desert
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And since I'm dropping some decent coin here, I want better consistency
FOOD	[ O  ]	Things I like:
FOOD	[ O  ]	* Love the staff here
FOOD	[ sugar ]	Even when the place is getting slammed by waves of morning commuters looking for their sugar and caffeine fix, I always get a smile and courteous service
FOOD	[ O  ]	*  Always love me some free wi--fi
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Never had a problem connecting or with download speeds
FOOD	[ O  ]	* The noise level indoors always seems to be a soft murmur, with some relaxing music wafting in the background
FOOD	[ conversation ]	 Never had a problem carrying on a conversation with my table mates
FOOD	[ Coffee ]	* When the FDA approves Alterra Coffee for intravenous use, I'll be first in line
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There are always are four or five roasts to choose from and I've never had a skunky cup
FOOD	[ O  ]	Things I don't
FOOD	[ O  ]	*The "cash only" thing was so hip in the 18th century, but it's 2013 now
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Start taking plastic, people
FOOD	[ O  ]	* The baked goods are not inexpensive
FOOD	[ muffin ]	 It's usually worth it, but it's annoying as hell when I lose the muffin lottery
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a solid three star option with lots of upside if the bakery improves its consistency
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seemed like a nice place
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, after waiting in line for 20 minutes and taking quite a while to give our order (because it was VERY loud) we were told that it would take about 30 minutes to get our food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not exactly what I wanted to hear after waiting 20 minutes but fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	When I try to pay I am informed that they do not accept debit/credit cards
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cash or check only!! No where on the door or while in line does it say cash or check only! There apparently is a very small sign on the register that says that but there is so much other crap posted in that area 99% of the people there probably never saw the sign
FOOD	[ age ]	This is just ridiculous in this day and age to not accept cards
FOOD	[ O  ]	Even worse is the BS sign on the register
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will never eat here again just because of this!Nice atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	Like an upscale Starbucks
FOOD	[ coffee, chai, sandwich, quiche ]	We ordered coffee, chai, a breakfast sandwich and quiche of the day
FOOD	[ O  ]	Was told drinks would be out in a few minutes but food would take 40 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't know if its always like that or if they were just short staffed
FOOD	[ min, quiche, sandwich ]	But seriously 40 min for a slice of quiche and a breakfast sandwich? We told them just make the drinks, forget the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Even so the drinks took 11 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place has potential but a wait like that is crazy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Would not recommend until they work their production issues out
FOOD	[ O  ]	One star
FOOD	[ O  ]	Disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	Looks great
FOOD	[ O  ]	Smells great
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	When they told me it would be a 30-40 minute wait for a breakfast sandwich I cancelled my order
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seems like an unworkable business model
FOOD	[ cook ]	Hire another cook and install another stove
FOOD	[ O  ]	Came all the way here from Spring Green--sad face
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think this is a good place to come for breakfast or lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is definitely homemade and tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Straightforward and good quality
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've often had the salads featured on their board and have really enjoyed them
FOOD	[ smoothies ]	Additionally, I've had soups and smoothies - also tasty and homey (in a good way)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would certainly recommend this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	It can get busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cash/check only and open until 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice place for meetings
FOOD	[ O  ]	Many tables spread out through the space
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is very good
FOOD	[ soup, bread, fruit ]	Cup of soup included bread AND pieces of fruit which was a sweet surprise
FOOD	[ pecan pie, latte, pumpkin, latte ]	The salted pecan pie latte is also a nice fall diversion from pumpkin latte
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice to have another local establishment
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bummed they only take cash as I rarely carry cash and for me that's why a star was lost
FOOD	[ chicken, cheese ]	I had the Tuscan chicken & 3 cheese
FOOD	[ choice ]	 Very yummy and served with a side choice
FOOD	[ fruit ]	 I chose the sliced fruit
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I can say it was worth the $10
FOOD	[ O  ]	not for just the food but the ambiance
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	  I'd come back here to try another hot sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Just keep in mind, at this moment the café is still cash only
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 Walk across the street grab yourself some cash and get here for a nice sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great location, nice atmosphere, good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	But very slow service, and overpriced
FOOD	[ sandwich, meat ]	I ordered a breakfast sandwich with no meat --  it took 20 minutes and cost $6
FOOD	[ O  ]	75
FOOD	[ O  ]	Weak food for yuppies
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overpriced
FOOD	[ O  ]	Underwhelming
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And you're surrounded by West Siders who should really know better
FOOD	[ O  ]	but of course don't
FOOD	[ Cafe ]	After reading the last few reviews, I had pretty low expectations for my lunch at Prairie Cafe & Bakery
FOOD	[ O  ]	I assumed I would have to wait a long time for my food and it would be just okay
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was pleasantly surprised
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	Our food came relatively quickly, and my husband and I both enjoyed our sandwiches
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I had a CBLT which was excellent
FOOD	[ bread, mayo ]	The bread was perfect, and I loved fresh ingredients and the special mayo
FOOD	[ tuna, melt ]	My husband really liked the special of the day, which was  a tuna melt
FOOD	[ bean, corn, salad, flavor ]	 My bean and corn side salad was very fresh tasting, but could have used a tad more flavor
FOOD	[ key lime, coconut, cookie ]	We also had a key lime coconut cookie that was AMAZING
FOOD	[ O  ]	I might have to go back next week just to get another one!!  The servers weren't overly friendly, but they definitely weren't UN-friendly
FOOD	[ sandwiches, cookie, Cafe, sandwiches ]	My only true "complaint" is that it is a bit pricy for what you get - it was almost $30 for our lunch of two sandwiches, two drinks, a cookie and a kid's meal- at least the kid's meal included the drink!  I will definitely be back to the Prairie Cafe! Don't let the other negative reviews scare you away! The sandwiches are definitely worth it! :)ONLY TAKES CASH OR CHECK!!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	So, this is not always a deal breaker, and I have been here before and went out of my way to return
FOOD	[ O  ]	I didn't either remember this rule, or it changed since I last visited, since I usually don't carry either
FOOD	[ O  ]	They won't pay the fee for the credit card machine, but want me to dish out money for checks or ATM fees
FOOD	[ O  ]	makes me mad on principle
FOOD	[ O  ]	And there is a Starbucks literally across the street or other local joints that will gladly take my debit/credit cards down the a little ways away that I will now know to frequent instead
FOOD	[ French toast ]	Nice atmosphere and great food, especially the breakfast!  The stuffed French toast special is fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I may be a bit biased because I've gone there growing upMay be one of Middleton's best kept secrets
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had run past Paul's on numerous mornings and always figured the illumated "Open" sign was an oversight
FOOD	[ O  ]	Turns out they really are open at 7am each morning, and that they do indeed serve breakfast, including a prime rib breakfast on Sundays! While I haven't had breakfast from Paul's yet, I can confirm that it smells great!
FOOD	[ O  ]	We did enjoy a few rounds of drinks while at Paul's last night, and really had a good time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The establishment is smoke-free (a HUGE bonus in our book), and is laid out in such a manner that the place doesn't feel crowded, even when it's busy
FOOD	[ cook ]	The service was top notch; we never waited or wanted for anything, and we enjoyed watching the cook prepare a wide variety of bar fare with impeccible precision and ease
FOOD	[ chicken, bacon, onions ]	The chicken tenders looked amazing, as did the bacon cheeseburgers with grilled onions
FOOD	[ O  ]	Portions were astronomically huge, and the most expensive menu item was $6
FOOD	[ O  ]	75
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't wait to go there for dinner some night
FOOD	[ O  ]	We finished our drinks, paid our tab, thanked the staff and headed home
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were thrilled with Paul's and will definitely be back
FOOD	[ O  ]	We'll update with a report on the food quality as well, but I have a feeling that it won't disappoint
FOOD	[ fries, onion rings, chicken ]	Go here for: drinks, after work gatherings, breakfast, and to enjoy what appears to be excellent "bar food" (burgers, fries, onion rings, chicken tenders, etc)
FOOD	[ fish ]	This is a local bar and not a fine dining restaurant, but they have a very friendly staff and serve a great Friday night all you can eat fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you can get past the noise level and the plain and simple accommodations, you will enjoy the food and the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	If your looking for bar food, that is what you will get
FOOD	[ O  ]	Average price, average food
FOOD	[ fish ]	All you can eat fish fry for $11
FOOD	[ O  ]	75! Of course Friday night
FOOD	[ O  ]	NICE Um yeah
FOOD	[ Fish, beat ]	lots of seating, TV's and Fish fry? you CANNOT beat it
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is great! (Bit of a drive from downtown madison) but isnt that what Yelp is all about? Seriously, cheap food, cheap drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	And PLENTY of it
FOOD	[ O  ]	plus this place has been around for quite a while! (longer than people might think)It delivers on the name
FOOD	[ O  ]	I stopped in after work for a drink and never tried the food but this is not my kind of place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food, drinks are priced decently, super friendly staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We stop in at least once a week
FOOD	[ O  ]	Far better then Bennett's for breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very clean
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Barkeeps very friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The other customers, bunch of ole timers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Gotta love the stories they tell, and banter back in forth
FOOD	[ O  ]	  You walked a stranger, but you leave there as family
FOOD	[ O  ]	And the food is good too
FOOD	[ beef, buttery ]	Great neighborhood bar! There definitely isn't anything 'special' on tap here, but sometimes all you need is a PBR tallboy to quench your thirst! I don't come for the drinks anyway- the burgers are delicious! The local Knoche's beef and fluffy, buttery buns are SO GOOD
FOOD	[ fish, coleslaw, potato, choice, cod, cod ]	And this is the place to come for your no-frills all-you-can-eat Friday night fish fry! You're served a dinner roll, coleslaw and potato (I always order hashbrowns!) and a choice between fried cod or perch or baked cod
FOOD	[ cod ]	Do yourself a favor and order at least one round of the baked cod! It absolutely melts in your mouth!Average place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Average food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Fried stuff and fried burgers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Loud
FOOD	[ fish ]	 Rowdy crowd for fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Much better places around
FOOD	[ O  ]	Unless you like average
FOOD	[ Fish ]	Fish fry was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 One helping was more than enough
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Crowd a little old for us, but they were very friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	Eclectic (but down-to-earth), Upbeat, Friendly, Inexpensive, Near-healthy (see menu), Kid-friendly, Fast, Clean, Variety
FOOD	[ O  ]	What more could one ask for?Okay, sorry guys
FOOD	[ O  ]	but I was NOT impressed
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just happened to be in the neighborhood
FOOD	[ O  ]	so I decided to go to Chin's because I could sit outside
FOOD	[ lettuce, fried rice ]	I ordered the lettuce wraps and the fried rice
FOOD	[ meat ]	The meat in the wraps was sub-standard and reminded me of dog food
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sauce was pretty much the only good part
FOOD	[ fried rice, shrimp, crab ]	The fried rice was described to have veggies and shrimp and crab
FOOD	[ O  ]	when it came out, it was so obviously KRAB
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ugh
FOOD	[ O  ]	I won't be wasting my money again
FOOD	[ fast food ]	Chin's is my go-to "fast food" stop in my neighborhood
FOOD	[ O  ]	I fell in love with Chin's when I was living across the street from their downtown location
FOOD	[ Lotus ]	I usually go with a selection from the kid's menu, the Smiling Lotus Plate
FOOD	[ chicken, breast, choice, lemon, teriyaki, choice, rice, cream cheese, chocolate, cookie, milk ]	A battered chicken breast with your choice of sauce (lemon, sweet & sour, and teriyaki - though I'm sure you can pick any sauce, these are just the kid-friendly flavors), choice of rice (white or brown), two cream cheese puffs, a chocolate-coated fortune cookie, and soda or milk, all for $4
FOOD	[ O  ]	17 including tax
FOOD	[ O  ]	The SLP is by far the best deal around for my thrifty needs
FOOD	[ meat ]	The adult entrees cost twice as much, and though they offer more meat, they do not include any of the other goodies
FOOD	[ chicken, breast ]	One chicken breast is plenty for me
FOOD	[ chicken, string, chicken ]	Despite being inexpensive, the chicken is fairly good quality - I've never had any gross bits (like the weird slimy string you find in chicken tenders at a lot of places)
FOOD	[ rice ]	Occasionally the rice is on the dry side, but that's why man invented sauce
FOOD	[ Lotus, lemon sauce, rice, Sesame, Chicken ]	Though 9 times out of 10 I opt for the Smiling Lotus Plate (with lemon sauce & white rice, if you're wondering), occasionally I'll get the Sesame Chicken
FOOD	[ chicken, rice ]	Lots of chicken, plenty of rice, two meals easy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm confused why anyone would choose to go here
FOOD	[ Noodles ]	To be clear, my expectations were that it would be an all Asian version of Noodles & Co
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Cheap, decent, fresh food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cheap - yep
FOOD	[ O  ]	Decent - no
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fresh - maybe at one point
FOOD	[ curry, noodles ]	I ordered the Thai curry noodles
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not impressed
FOOD	[ curry, flavor ]	 I've never tasted something that claimed to be curry with so little flavor
FOOD	[ vegetables ]	 My vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Yuck
FOOD	[ teriyaki, noodles, flavor ]	 My boyfriend ordered the teriyaki udon, and the noodles were too skinny to be udon with the same flavor issues
FOOD	[ chili, garlic ]	 Not even the chili garlic sauce did much to it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Chin's - good concept, but a waste of money even at $6
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ashley V said it best "why would anyone choose to go here?" I am still traveling, and the indignities of the Midwest continue
FOOD	[ O  ]	I didn't think it was cheap
FOOD	[ O  ]	I knew I was not going to get real Chinese food, I knew I was coming in to get a pseudo version of Americanized Chinese food
FOOD	[ O  ]	My first indication that I was not in Peking, was the Hispanic girl struggling to understand my English ordering and the POS system which was also in English
FOOD	[ O  ]	Damn oppressive society
FOOD	[ O  ]	Anyway, I really should not disparage global initiative the restaurant is embracing
FOOD	[ Indian, India ]	We are all going to be working for Indian companies, as Obama went specifically to India to procure 15 million jobs to alleviate the unemployment crisis in this country
FOOD	[ O  ]	I welcome TATA motors and their cardboard framed cars
FOOD	[ O  ]	I digress
FOOD	[ O  ]	Rosa, or whatever her name was, with the help of her friend, Miguel (probably not his name, and he was clearly only working there because it was too cold for his primary profession, that being a jockey) managed to screw up my order twice, overcharged me twice and never apologized
FOOD	[ O  ]	Almost thought I was in Los Angeles again
FOOD	[ cream cheese ]	The cream cheese puffs were soggy, greasy and about as far from "puffy" as one could get
FOOD	[ chicken, fatty ]	The chicken was white, but it was also fatty and grisly
FOOD	[ spring rolls, flavor ]	The Thai spring rolls were not bad flavor but they too were greasy and not very crispy
FOOD	[ fried rice, rice, mushrooms, egg ]	The fried rice was disgusting, just a greasy mush of dirty looking rice, mushrooms and egg
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finally, the pot stickers, ah the pot stickers, they should have stuck to the pot
FOOD	[ mash ]	The filling was some processed mash of something, while the outside was supposed to have been lightly pan fried, let's emphasize the word "lightly
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is not very good Asian food
FOOD	[ choice ]	I would suggest that there must be a better choice in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am sure there are Asians in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have not seen them, but somewhere in this land must lay a pocket of Asians
FOOD	[ O  ]	There is a university, with a math and an engineering department 
FOOD	[ O  ]	There has to be Asians somewhere, I would suggest to find them, and ask them where to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am sure Chin's would not be on their list
FOOD	[ fast food, shrimp ]	For what it is, a fast food Americanized Oriental restaurant, it's not overly bad, as long as you don't order shrimp
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service: I've never had a problem here
FOOD	[ O  ]	While not always the most outgoing service, they are friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	My order is always ready in a decent amount of time
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never dined in, so I won't comment on atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line
FOOD	[ O  ]	For the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections
FOOD	[ Fast Food ]	I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's nothing really special
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit
FOOD	[ Shrimp ]	I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking
FOOD	[ Shrimp, digestive, shrimp, digestive ]	For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach
FOOD	[ devein, shrimp ]	I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking
FOOD	[ shrimp, appetite ]	I pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite
FOOD	[ shrimp, brown rice ]	I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well
FOOD	[ O  ]	So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	Lesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs
FOOD	[ O  ]	**** I thought eventually I'd go back, but I haven't been since then
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had some of their food catered in for work, it was overcooked, rubbery, and chewy
FOOD	[ O  ]	yeah, next time I'll get my own lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've definitely had better
FOOD	[ O  ]	The overall quality of all the food
FOOD	[ chicken ]	veggies and chicken, was definitely poor
FOOD	[ date ]	I ate it but will definitely not go there again!My husband and I went out here on our date night
FOOD	[ Noodles ]	Walking through the door we instantly thought Noodles and Co
FOOD	[ O  ]	due to the menu layout on the wall
FOOD	[ stage ]	It being our first time here we made it through the typical awkward stage of processing the scene to figure out how to order and the drink situation
FOOD	[ O  ]	(they have a soda fountain that is hard to see to the left)   My husband was very satisfied with the place but I'm still a little reserved
FOOD	[ O  ]	I got the stirfry which was okay
FOOD	[ vegetables ]	I think the crunchy vegetables were the best
FOOD	[ O  ]	The stir fry sauce was a little bland for my liking
FOOD	[ sesame, chicken ]	As usual my husband shared with me a piece of his sesame chicken and I instantly got jealous
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wanted his plate
FOOD	[ appetizers, spring rolls, cream cheese, fried rice ]	LOL For two people w drinks two appetizers (2 spring rolls, 3 cream cheese puffs) plus each upgrading to 10 ingredient fried rice $1
FOOD	[ O  ]	75 it to $27 and change
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had a living social coupon for $20 my husband still wants to come back but if I do I'm ordering off the classic menu as he did
FOOD	[ O  ]	Live and learn I guess
FOOD	[ O  ]	:) A plus, they have an outside patio
FOOD	[ O  ]	After going to the Chin's on State St
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was pretty sure I'd never go to Chin's again
FOOD	[ O  ]	But this location is close to my work and a coworker invited me
FOOD	[ O  ]	Perhaps I am also weak?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Anyway I was pleasantly surprised to find that, for whatever reason, the food here seemed much better
FOOD	[ noodles ]	It could maybe be argued that the noodles are a little heavy on the sauce, but everything else seemed fine
FOOD	[ tofu ]	The tofu and veggies are well prepared and chewable (not the case on State St!) and really that's all I need
FOOD	[ O  ]	In addition the staff is always pleasant and the food comes out quickly
FOOD	[ O  ]	We LOVE this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is excellent, service fast, huge portions, reasonable prices
FOOD	[ Egg, soup, spring rolls, bourbon, chicken, fried rice ]	Egg drop soup, spring rolls, bourbon chicken with veg fried rice--fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	You will not be sorry you visited
FOOD	[ O  ]	On nice evenings or lunches, eat outside 
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was alright, the service was alright, the portion size was generous, the prices was alright
FOOD	[ O  ]	3 stars for a decent place to grab food if you're in a hurry, but nothing special
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was in the area
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was about to go to Pho Nam but decided to try Chins
FOOD	[ Noodles ]	My first impression was that this was a lot like Noodles and company with a Chinese decor
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 It felt it fell short in ambiance and flavor for me
FOOD	[ Noodles ]	I ordered the Thai Noodles
FOOD	[ Noodles, noodles, bok choy, red onions, pea ]	Thai Noodles: wide Asian noodles with bok choy, red onions, pea pods, and water
FOOD	[ chestnuts, coconut, curry, lime ]	chestnuts in coconut curry with Thai seasonings, garnished with lime,
FOOD	[ red pepper ]	red pepper, and sprouts
FOOD	[ flavor ]	I didn't feel like this had a lot of flavor
FOOD	[ coconut, curry, flavor ]	 It was barely coconut curry and actually had a flavor that was different from anything I have ever had before
FOOD	[ O  ]	  The vegetable were fresh and the portion was good
FOOD	[ O  ]	My overall experience was so so but I still ended up having a good time because I was able to witness an exchange between some people that was something like a scene out of the movie Slacker by Linklater
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was awkward
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A true cringe moment
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Bizarre
FOOD	[ O  ]	Some people can be so cold and insensitive
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It went on for about 5 minutes and really made my stop there interesting
FOOD	[ O  ]	There were a lot of people here from what it looked like they were on lunch from nearby businesses
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The folks here really work their butts off
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But the food and the restaurant could be so much better
FOOD	[ O  ]	Much like it's former State Street counterpart, this place used to be awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is still good, but it's not so fast anymore and the ingredients seem to be a bit skimpy
FOOD	[ Fried Rice, shrimp ]	My 10 Ingredient Fried Rice had about 4 shrimp
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lame
FOOD	[ O  ]	Still - it's all delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	But I never used to have to wait 15 minutes and it all-around used to be shinier
FOOD	[ O  ]	We love Asia Fresh
FOOD	[ bourbon, chicken, fried rice ]	bourbon chicken with veg fried rice-perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	Take away done quickly
FOOD	[ O  ]	service great
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great price
FOOD	[ O  ]	We did takeout from here and both thought our dinners were awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We ordered:
FOOD	[ Chicken, Sesame, choice ]	- Chicken wings with Sesame Szechuan sauce (you can get them with any stir fry sauce choice)
FOOD	[ soup ]	- Hot and sour soup
FOOD	[ spring rolls ]	- Thai spring rolls
FOOD	[ Sesame, chicken ]	- Sesame chicken
FOOD	[ chicken ]	- Sweet and sour chicken
FOOD	[ rush ]	Then we got stuck in rush hour/post blizzard traffic and had a 40 minute commute home
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 We were both impressed how well the food held up after that amount of time! The flavor of the wings was good, but they were obviously no longer hot
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Next time we will try those when we dine in
FOOD	[ heat, flavor ]	  Everything else had lots of heat and flavor
FOOD	[ soup ]	 The hot and sour soup looked different than any other I have eaten, but it was still good and plenty hot
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I did not detect much sour in it, my only small complaint
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We both felt we had more than enough food for $23, and the quality was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We will definitely go back
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I am actually a little shocked at all the bad reviews on this place after our dining experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not sure if they have improved things or we just hit it on a good night
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service was fast, friendly and accurate
FOOD	[ O  ]	no complaints there
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food here is quite good actually
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not 5 star restaurant quality but for the price and service, it's decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff was friendly and I didn't wait long in line
FOOD	[ teriyaki, chicken, cream, chocolate, cookie ]	The teriyaki chicken and cream puffs are my favorites and even though the chocolate covered fortune cookie was meant for little kids, I still have the balls to ask for one lol
FOOD	[ choice ]	Overall, not a bad choice at all
FOOD	[ bat ]	Oh and I'll say it straight off the bat, this place is not authentic asian food
FOOD	[ fast food ]	But for what it is (which is pan asian fast food), it did not disappoint me
FOOD	[ Fast food ]	Fast food Chinese is generally not that exciting, but I must say this place really was quite impressive
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very fresh tasting ingredients with a lot of good flavors, all served hot and with a smile
FOOD	[ cream cheese ]	What more could you ask for?A fast-casual spin-off of a Minnesota-based, fast-food Chinese-American chain that likewise serves nothing special, Chin's gets one star for being the only Asian-American place I know of in Dane County that serves fried cream cheese wontons without crabmeat
FOOD	[ epinephrine, crab ]	I require a side dish of epinephrine if I eat crab, so I appreciate this omission
FOOD	[ cream cheese ]	Now that I have established that I go here just for the cream cheese puffs, it should be clear that I'm far from an expert on Asian food
FOOD	[ salt ]	So take the rest of my review with a grain of salt; there should be plenty to spare in your entree
FOOD	[ chili, garlic, potstickers, lettuce, fatty, meat ]	I used to think this place was ok -- it still has plenty of variety, a very friendly staff, good chili-garlic sauce, decent potstickers, above-average lettuce wraps, no grisly or fatty pieces of meat -- but lately the preparation has been sloppy and the presentation just as bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	I suspect the quality of the ingredients has come down a notch
FOOD	[ cream cheese ]	After cream cheese wontons, Pad Thai is one of my favorite Asian entrees
FOOD	[ porridge ]	My last order looked like Goldilocks's porridge in the "Three Little Bears" Golden Book I had as a kid
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dull gray, soupy, greasy, salty and watery, yet somehow sticky
FOOD	[ chicken ]	The chopped peanuts added no crunch at all, which is too bad because other than the chicken pieces I picked through the mess to find, I was hoping to find something else edible
FOOD	[ O  ]	Epic fail on this entree
FOOD	[ noodles, chicken ]	On my next visit, I ordered the Firecracker noodles with chicken, as a side to my beloved wontons
FOOD	[ grease ]	Slight improvement from last time but still salty as the Dead Sea and enough grease to de-squeak every door hinge on the west side
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bag was so heavy I skipped my biceps workout for a week
FOOD	[ O  ]	The red peppers had no life left
FOOD	[ chicken, white meat ]	Again, I hunted and pecked for the chicken, which is consistently decent-quality, well-prepared white meat
FOOD	[ fried rice, salt, vegetables ]	My wife's veggie fried rice would have been ok -- they ease up on the salt and Valvoline for this entree -- but the vegetables were overcooked and charred in places
FOOD	[ scallions, broccoli, pea ]	Fresh veggies should present as a bright spectrum of colors -- orange from the carrots, bright green from the scallions, broccoli and pea pods, yellow from the corncobettes
FOOD	[ color, fried rice ]	Instead, however, they were the same brown color as the fried rice
FOOD	[ cookie ]	My last fortune cookie said I'll probably return to Chin's
FOOD	[ cream cheese ]	It's on the way home from work, the food comes out fast and I can't resist those damn cream cheese wontons
FOOD	[ potstickers ]	Maybe I'll throw in some potstickers or wraps and call it dinner
FOOD	[ base ]	I like that I can add items to a base entree to make it my own
FOOD	[ peanut, lo mein ]	 I love the Thai peanut lo mein
FOOD	[ noodles ]	 the noodles were easy to eat (they were cut shorter)
FOOD	[ O  ]	We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away
FOOD	[ O  ]	On their menu it says $15 minimum
FOOD	[ O  ]	We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum
FOOD	[ O  ]	We found that insane so never ordered
FOOD	[ lemon, chicken, batter ]	I always get the lemon chicken and it's delicious! Nice light batter and very crispy with a good amount of sauce
FOOD	[ potstickers ]	The potstickers are also very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Only thing less disappointing then the food is the staff
FOOD	[ soup, Sesame, Chicken ]	  Ordered Chin Wings, Hot & Sour soup and Sesame Chicken to go
FOOD	[ lemon, chicken ]	What I get in return is Chin Wings with the wrong stir fry sauce, a cup of hot & sour and lemon chicken
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They charged me for what I ordered, yet they still refused a refund me or to replace my food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Avoid this place like the plague
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But yet again, the staff managed to screw my order up and ended up charging me more then what I should of payed for
FOOD	[ O  ]	We come here a lot and the food is never consistent
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sometimes it's really salty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Other times it's too spicy or not spicy enough
FOOD	[ O  ]	There must be several different cooks because the sauce is never the same either
FOOD	[ O  ]	We still like the adventure of what we may get today
FOOD	[ O  ]	Stop for quick bite on the way home
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you tried it and didn't like it you may want to try again, you may be surprised at how much better or different the next time may be
FOOD	[ O  ]	The servers here are friendly enough but some times they difficult to read
FOOD	[ O  ]	Place is not always clean but it's clean enough
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't like the fact that some of the tables are falling apart but there is always customers here so they must be doing something right
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food and prices are reasonable!I will never order from there again
FOOD	[ chicken ]	I called to find out what was on the hot and spicy chicken
FOOD	[ broccoli, peas, onions ]	The person who answered informed me that it was both hot and spicy but it was serves with broccoli, snow peas and onions
FOOD	[ O  ]	Once I got my entree it was neither hot nor spicy
FOOD	[ broccoli ]	On top of that, there was no broccoli
FOOD	[ onions, peas, chicken ]	Too many onions, barely any snow peas AND a very small amount of chicken
FOOD	[ chicken, chicken, chicken, flavor ]	Did I mention that I don't think the chicken was actually chicken? It was cut so thin and had no chicken flavor
FOOD	[ rice ]	The white rice that accompanied my dish was mushy and clumped together
FOOD	[ rice ]	I've made better rice boiling it
FOOD	[ chicken ]	My mom had the Kung pao chicken and she was also dissatisfied with her meal
FOOD	[ crab ]	The crab Rangoon was ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fairly basic
FOOD	[ O  ]	I won't return there
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would prefer to give it a ZEROHubby has been eating here for years but since I only occasionally visit WI, he never convinced me to give this little dive a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now I'm sad about what i've been missing! Cannot understand how they do it for SO cheap - amazingly fresh, tasty, generous Chinese
FOOD	[ O  ]	Clean, open kitchen, very fast and large variety
FOOD	[ O  ]	Liked it so much that I got a lunch special to go for the bus ride over to O'Hare
FOOD	[ condiments ]	They packed it up tight but remember to take napkins, condiments and utensils
FOOD	[ shrimp, broccoli, shrimp ]	I loved the shrimp with broccoli (also had carrots) and the shrimp were large and plentiful
FOOD	[ soup, dumplings ]	Wonton soup (4 big dumplings) on a cold day was delish and included in the lunch special
FOOD	[ chicken, egg foo yung, egg roll, brown sauce ]	Also got chicken egg foo yung which included large, well filled egg roll - also tasty, mustardy sauce OK (not as good as the brown sauce I'm used to)
FOOD	[ pork, fried rice ]	All lunch specials include roast pork fried rice which was good enough to buy on its own
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seems like a mom/pop place so support your local Chinese joint - down with PF/PW/PE
FOOD	[ O  ]	We go here pretty regularly
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is good, but by no means great
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is pretty divey looking (photos of food, etc) and they mess up our order abt 20% of the time, but still a good value for the price
FOOD	[ General Tso's chicken ]	General Tso's chicken is great
FOOD	[ brown rice, fried rice ]	I asked for brown rice once and they gave us fried rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	to their credit, it was brown :)I have ordered food from here on numerous occasions
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's always been good and reasonably priced
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wish they delivered
FOOD	[ O  ]	That is the only drawback
FOOD	[ O  ]	Went to Denny's this morning for breakfast with my twins and fiance
FOOD	[ O  ]	We walked in the door and their was no hostess which is understandable if they are busy but they really weren't
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had at least five servers look dead at us as well as cooks and stood there for a good five minutes and still no one said anything to us so we walked out and went to the McDonald's across the street
FOOD	[ O  ]	always great food with great service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nothing too fancy but fills you up and gets you on the way
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hard to rate a McDonald's well
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 I go through the drive thru most mornings for coffee and will eat lunch there from time to time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Drive thru service is always great and restaurant is always clean
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They hire and retain good help
FOOD	[ O  ]	This might be the best run McDonalds in the Madison area
FOOD	[ milkshake ]	The drive-through runs incredibly fast! Plus, it's a throw back McDonalds with a displayed old milkshake machine that triggered Ray Kroc's involvement in the company, and resulted in him bringing in a franchise model that facilitated the restaurant's world-wide domination
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, who checks for a McDonalds rating?I ate here on Dec 1st (big mac combo) and it did not feel well after words
FOOD	[ beef ]	I learned that they and all Mc D's use ammoniated beef, it is frank'in food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Madison is full of privately owned restaurants that serve real food, not chemical and byproducts dressed up as food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Save your kids, save your self
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just say no to the evil fake foodThe Hody is a pretty solid local bar in Middleton that often has great live music and decent drink specials
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Thursday nights feature Westside Andy & Mel Ford, and that is always a good time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There are decent taps, though last time I was there I believe they had removed Esser's Best which was my go-to every time there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Most of the specials tend toward the $1 shot variety, but I especially like that Capital pints are $2 on Wednesdays and you can get pitchers of Spotted on Fridays for a crazy $5
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I also learned that your second drink before noon on Sundays is free, and domestic taps are 50 cents
FOOD	[ O  ]	 More on that later
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The bartenders are for the most part good, but if you're there on the wrong day they seem to forget about you in favor of talking with the regulars
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is pretty standard: not too fancy but good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Sometimes the food doesn't come as advertised in the menu
FOOD	[ Swiss cheese, sandwich ]	 Once I ordered a Reuben that strangely was lacking Swiss cheese, though I didn't notice until halfway through as it was still a tasty sandwich
FOOD	[ bison, tomatoes ]	 I like the bison burger here, but the last time I ordered this it came sans tomatoes, likely due to the salmonella issue at the time
FOOD	[ Chicken, buffalo ]	 Also that day my sister found the Hody Chicken's buffalo sauce to be beyond her tolerance for spiciness
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My sister's boyfriend was suitably impressed with the Hody burger, but he thought that they had left of the special Hody sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It might have just been a bad day, because most of the other times I've been here there were no problems
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I do believe that the overall quality depends on the day you stop in
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Some of the bartenders kind of throw things together, while others take their time and do a decent job
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I haven't been there regularly enough to establish a schedule, so it's been hit or miss for me lately
FOOD	[ appetizers, onion ]	 I've also tried a few of the appetizers and the onion straws and quesidilla wrappers are very good every time I've had them
FOOD	[ O  ]	The main drawback with the Hody is the regular crowd
FOOD	[ O  ]	 On Thursdays when Westside Andy & Mel Ford are playing the crowd is great - a variety of people, young and old, some dancing to the music, some sitting at the bar or nearby tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Other nights the crowd can get a bit too townie for my liking
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It can be uncomfortable, especially when half the bar turns to look at you when you walk in
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Sundays can be the worst
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I think that some of those people nearly live there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The place is pretty open and there is a lot of space, but it still can get quite smoky
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There is a few outdoor tables along Elmwood, and these are perfect for a weekend afternoon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I would probably return to the Hody more if it weren't for the small inconsistencies in the food and the slight hostile feeling that I sometimes pick up from the regulars, but overall the Hody is a reliably good time
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have decent drink specials
FOOD	[ O  ]	However the bar is sometimes filled with older trashier drunks
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its defintely an older crowd where Cougars are lurking
FOOD	[ O  ]	On the weekend they have free live music
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its usually too loud to converse with your group but the bands usually arn't terrible
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ive never had their food but Ive heard its pretty decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall it an ok place to go to get a few drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sadly its one of the better bars in Middleton
FOOD	[ Boar, grill ]	Not as much of a dive as the Club Tavern or Bristled Boar and not as Towny as Pauls grill 
FOOD	[ O  ]	And if your into older trashy women this place is for you
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just had to review to mention my addiction
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Hody Club
FOOD	[ club sandwich, egg ]	Its a club sandwich with a fried egg on it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Most will think it sounds gross
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	They do something to make this sandwich just magical
FOOD	[ O  ]	SO good - I want one every time I hear Hody
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum
FOOD	[ O  ]	They also have awesome Quesadilla's too
FOOD	[ O  ]	We usually get ours with spicy, but I think you can customize
FOOD	[ O  ]	Otherwise a decent bar with average prices and service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good TVs and a very local crowd
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think they have small bands on the weekends
FOOD	[ club sandwich ]	Absolutely the best club sandwich I have had in a looong time
FOOD	[ O  ]	I order it everytime I go and it has never been less than awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	And it's priced really well
FOOD	[ O  ]	Anytime I've gone at night the crowd is a little rough looking and the music is too loud
FOOD	[ O  ]	But going in the early evening or for lunch usually works pretty well
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	Went here for lunch because we had coupons for bogo sandwiches
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was pretty good for a little WI bar! The biggest downfall was that their freezer had just broken so we could not get any fried apps
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitress did let us use both of our coupons even though she said they were one per table (that was not printed on them) but still nice of her! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	SO CHEAP! Out bill was around $20 for 4 people!?I'm from a small town in Kentucky
FOOD	[ O  ]	I likely won't attend my 30-year high school reunion, but I imagine it will look exactly like Hody's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lotta flannel shirts and fiddle playing in here tonight
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cowboy hats, beards, and MILFs a'prowling
FOOD	[ O  ]	God bless America
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only drawback is that there seems to be a raspy, sideshow bob type of lady chain-smoking outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	I guess that comes with the territory
FOOD	[ cheese sticks ]	The skating rink cheese sticks more than make up for that spectacle
FOOD	[ game, game, Cocktail ]	Happened to be here for a recent Packer game, partly cuz they advertise half price apps during the game and partly cuz of their presence in 'Madison Cocktail' book
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was sketchy at best
FOOD	[ beer ]	Waited 10-15 minutes for a beer and then was advised only 'select' apps were half price [2-3 of 16 on menu]?! Hmmm
FOOD	[ cocktail ]	Also use of the cocktail book was viewed as a nuisance
FOOD	[ O  ]	I say if you sell them readily accept them 
FOOD	[ club sandwich ]	In summary,felt like the customer catered to the server rather than vice versa To their credit Hody club sandwich was very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	A wide variety of people mingle at this bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	classy, trashy, young, old, professional, you name it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The band was o
FOOD	[ beer ]	, the beer was not very cold but the prices were ok for the area
FOOD	[ appearance ]	 This place needs to place more emphasis on bartenders that are courteous and clean in appearance
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Probably the longest wait for a drink in an unpopulated establishment!!  Tip accordinglyMy boyfriend and I headed out to Louisianne's on the recommendation of a couple of his friends
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were encouraged to make reservations as the couple noted how this place is frequently filled to capacity every night
FOOD	[ O  ]	Well, Sunday night it's not so
FOOD	[ O  ]	And that's when we went
FOOD	[ O  ]	Louisianne's is located underground, and the atmosphere below is warm and inviting
FOOD	[ stage ]	To the left is the bar with the piano and stage for the jazz bands that play nearly every night
FOOD	[ O  ]	In front of and to the right are small, white-clothed tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our service was excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	Because there happened to be so few people there that night, the host and the waitress were both quite talkative and welcoming
FOOD	[ appetizers ]	The meal was delicious (you don't need appetizers here - the entree portions are QUITE large)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back for the nights of live jazz
FOOD	[ O  ]	BEST
FOOD	[ O  ]	CREME
FOOD	[ O  ]	BRULEE
FOOD	[ O  ]	EVER!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	And the food, the piano bar, the service is ABSOLUTELY to die for
FOOD	[ O  ]	Louisiannes is the kind of place that you can GENUINELY never go wrong
FOOD	[ wine ]	 It's in an underground cave, very "Adams Family Values" (Ok, isn't it bad that I compare it to a movie), their wine list is VERY extensive, and if you go at ~6ish, there's always the piano man, ready to delect you with a rendition of a bluesy jazzy tune
FOOD	[ O  ]	While I think reservation is HIGHLY recommended (there's like 10 tables at MOST), it just so happens that everytime my husband and I go, we can get in
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lucky us!!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seriously, by far one of the BEST restaurants in Madison (whoops Middleton)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum - I love Louisianne's
FOOD	[ O  ]	A bit fancy for every day, but the food is fantastic, the atmosphere in the restaurant is great and the service has always been good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very delicious! I can't wait to go back!Grade: C
FOOD	[ Cajun ]	Skip the overpriced, nasty Cajun food and go for the desserts! Very pricey
FOOD	[ O  ]	I plan to give this place another try soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of my favorite dining experiences in the Madison area
FOOD	[ O  ]	The underground atmosphere at Louisianne's is quaint yet not unsophisticated; we went on the eve of a snowstorm, so the pianist didn't make it in to play--though I'm sure he would have made a nice dinnertime addition
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was friendly and efficient
FOOD	[ lemon, artichoke, appetizer, bruschetta, tomatoes, lemon, parmesan ]	Our lemon artichoke appetizer was excellent--akin to bruschetta, but minus the tomatoes and plus pine nuts and a decadent lemon-y parmesan topping
FOOD	[ catfish, spinach, mashed potatoes ]	For an entree, I ordered the blackened catfish with spinach mashed potatoes, and wasn't disappointed
FOOD	[ fish ]	though I will say my fish was seasoned on the heavy side
FOOD	[ O  ]	I didn't mind the additional kick, but you may want to let the staff know if you don't like the sensation of blackened fire-breathing between bites
FOOD	[ wine ]	I was also pleased with the wine selection
FOOD	[ chocolate, dessert, cajun, spice ]	And really, how can you go wrong with the chocolate creme brulee for dessert? Thanks, Louisianne's, for a warm, inviting dinner--and for heating me up with enough cajun spice to temporarily make me forget how blustery it is outdoors!Tops: Ambiance, particularly on a cold winter night
FOOD	[ Wine ]	 Wine list - well balanced and fairly priced
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Sitting at the bar listening to music - you could do it all night
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food: Good, but can be a bit over-rich at times and it is not cheap
FOOD	[ O  ]	Desserts are uber
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service: For me, it has always been good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not knock your socks off but good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Atmosphere in the downstairs dining room is nice quiet
FOOD	[ conversation ]	A good place to go with friends and have a conversation
FOOD	[ escargot, garlic ]	 I had the escargot which was good -- could have had a little more garlic
FOOD	[ Red beans, rice ]	Red beans & rice was especially good
FOOD	[ Salad ]	Salad was average
FOOD	[ O  ]	For out of towners staying at the "big box" motels at the edge of town this place is way better than the chain restaurants around the motels and well worth the short walk into town (maybe not in winter)
FOOD	[ cajun ]	I was really excited to come here and usually really like cajun food
FOOD	[ rice, beans ]	What I got was a plate full of super-salty rice and beans
FOOD	[ O  ]	I couldn't finish it and left hungry
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm hoping it was just a mistake
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll give it another try one of these days
FOOD	[ O  ]	I decided, after much positive feedback from clients of mine(and a peek at my fellow yelpers reviews), to surprise my BF with dinner at Louisianne's for our third anniversary tonight
FOOD	[ O  ]	From the moment we walked in, I was really charmed
FOOD	[ O  ]	It has this cavernous feel(in a good, cozy romantic way--not a dank, moldy creepy way) with nice lighting and just all around nice ambiance
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our waitress was good, if a bit overzealous
FOOD	[ carafe, iced tea, glass ]	and I loved the fact that she automatically brought me a small carafe of iced tea when she brought my filled glass
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice
FOOD	[ tea, shrimp, corn, chowder, shrimp, shrimp ]	I'm a heavy(tea) drinker, so this was great! I enjoyed my shrimp and corn chowder, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more shrimp(but when is TOO MUCH shrimp ever possible)
FOOD	[ shrimp, flavor, rosemary ]	I also had roasted shrimp for my entree, which were delicious! Nice spicy flavor, with a ton of rosemary
FOOD	[ spinach, tomatoes ]	I wasn't too impressed with the side of spinach and tomatoes, however
FOOD	[ Cabernet ]	The Cabernet reduction that they came DOUSED in was a bit too rich
FOOD	[ glaze ]	I wish it had been more of a glaze than a heavy sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	No matter, I was too full to eat much of it anyhow
FOOD	[ coffee, chicken, ricotta ]	My boyfriend seemed surprised and delighted by the coffee roasted chicken with the orange-ricotta sauce( the bite I had was quite tasty)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, I love the fact that they have live jazz on the piano tues-sat nights starting at 6pm(although tonight he started more like 6:30)
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was really nice
FOOD	[ appetizers ]	We said that we would definitely go another night for drinks and appetizers(which looked tempting) in the bar/lounge area with friends
FOOD	[ O  ]	Louisianne's has seared it's place inside of my restaurant experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is so good, that every time my girlfriend and I consider going to any other restuarant, we would have to consider the huge opportunity cost of not going to Louisianne's
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place is dungeon-esque, but not in a bad way
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's dimly lit, underground, but often times has a pianist setting the New Orleans mood
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is incredible
FOOD	[ O  ]	Every time we go there we try to get something different, and we're floored by how good the meals are, and how much of it you get
FOOD	[ appetizers, pulled pork, crepes, soup, flavor ]	The appetizers were delicious (we've had the platter for two, and the pulled pork crepes), the soup we've had with our entrees were amazing each time, with an intense flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their specials change every time we've been there, and if they don't interest you, their regular menu is always exceptional
FOOD	[ shrimp, shrimp, duck, steak, seafood, au gratin ]	We've had the roasted shrimp, the tasso and shrimp fettucine, the maple-cured duck, the steak, the seafood au gratin, and each time not only did we get one delicious meal, but enough to have an amazing lunch the next day
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only con I can give Louisianne's is that they give you so much good food that you can never get to the desserts
FOOD	[ O  ]	This restaurant is the one that my girlfriend and I benchmark all other restaurants by, and before we go out to eat anywhere else, we have to strongly consider the consequences of NOT going to Louisianne's
FOOD	[ O  ]	My boyfriend and I went here on a whim one night
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was totally underwhelmed
FOOD	[ O  ]	First of all, the service was REEEEEALLY slow
FOOD	[ appetizer ]	 from the appetizer on down, everything took forever to arrive
FOOD	[ lemon, parmesan, artichoke ]	The lemon parmesan artichoke hearts were delicious!  the flavors were all perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That was my favorite part of the meal
FOOD	[ salad ]	 My salad was good
FOOD	[ soup ]	 My boyfriend didn't like his soup, so we traded
FOOD	[ soup ]	 The soup was just okay
FOOD	[ duck, fatty, duck ]	I ordered the maple cured duck, and I was surprised at how fatty and tough my duck was
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I really had a hard time eating it because the texture in my mouth made me kind of gag
FOOD	[ flavor, duck ]	 the veggies it came with were good, and the flavor of the duck was good
FOOD	[ duck, coffee, chicken ]	 I'm not normally one to order duck, and I really wished I didn't (I was torn about the coffee chicken
FOOD	[ chicken ]	 I normally get chicken, but it seemed like an odd combo of flavors)
FOOD	[ seafood, au gratin ]	My boyfriend got the seafood au gratin which was much better
FOOD	[ bread, ass ]	The best part was that I was so full on bread by the time my entree arrived that I didn't feel like so much of an ass asking for most of my meal to be put in a doggie bag
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'd be willing to give this place another chance though
FOOD	[ O  ]	Met some friends here for drinks at the bar, which is shockingly small and not suited for groups larger than 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	The house wines are excellent
FOOD	[ lemon, artichoke ]	I got the lemon artichoke hearts - which were awful, and overpriced
FOOD	[ bread, crumbs, butter, lemon ]	The bread crumbs were drenched in butter and had a greasy feel to them, and the lemon was overpowering
FOOD	[ O  ]	The piano player didn't know any of the songs my friends or I requested - and we weren't making ridiculous requests - what piano player doesn't know Irving Berlin? 
FOOD	[ wine ]	It's a great place to sit and talk and drink wine, AFTER you've eaten somewhere else
FOOD	[ O  ]	I saw Lousianne's on the news one night
FOOD	[ date ]	 So I took my boyfriend there for our date night
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were extremely underdressed for the occasion
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A co-worker had told me it was a little fancier than casual but we went totally casual anyway
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good news is, it had dim lightening
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We had a drink at the bar and were quickly seated
FOOD	[ pasta, steak ]	 I'm a vegetarian, so I tried a pasta dish while my boyfriend had steak
FOOD	[ goat cheese, appetizer ]	 We had the goat cheese appetizer, it was better than I expected
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It had a sauce to it that had a really unique taste to it
FOOD	[ pasta, jambalaya ]	 The entrees were good, I wouldn't say the pasta was worth the price and I wish I would have tried the vegetarian jambalaya
FOOD	[ White chocolate, mousse, dessert ]	 We topped off the meal with the White chocolate mousse  for dessert
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was the best part of the whole meal, knocked my socks off
FOOD	[ meat ]	I would recommend this place, especially to meat eaters
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was great, our waitress was timely
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She checked in often and never hurried us to finish and leave
FOOD	[ O  ]	All our friends had raved about the food & ambiance, so my wife & I finally decided to try Louisianne's
FOOD	[ cellar ]	 The decor is indeed cozy- like a nicely made-up cellar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There was plenty of room at the bar so we sat there before our reservation time arrived
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Only two beers on tap, but both good local brews from Capital
FOOD	[ O  ]	Eventually sat at our table & perused the menu
FOOD	[ appetizers ]	 Found many appetizers that sounded really good (including one of the specials that night) so we decided on sharing 2 apps and one entree
FOOD	[ O  ]	seemed like a good way to try a few items without getting too much food
FOOD	[ gnocchi, savory, cream sauce, crawfish ]	App #1 (the special): gnocchi in a savory cream sauce with crawfish was very tasty
FOOD	[ gnocchi ]	 Seemed a bit light in the gnocchi (I think there were 5 or 6) but made up for it in sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Two thumbs way up
FOOD	[ mussels, cream sauce ]	App #2: mussels in cream sauce
FOOD	[ mussels ]	I had asked about the size of the mussels ahead of time and was told they were medium to large
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They were in fact medium to small, which was a bit of a bummer because we probably would have gone with a different app had we known
FOOD	[ bread ]	 But the flavors were good & we enjoyed sopping up the sauce with the bread
FOOD	[ bread ]	 And the bread they serve is quite good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Two thumbs up
FOOD	[ Crawfish, Etouffe ]	Entree: Crawfish Etouffe
FOOD	[ etouffe ]	I was excited to try this as I hadn't had etouffe in years
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either
FOOD	[ Cajun ]	 If you went to a friend's house for dinner and they served this you'd be psyched, but at an upscale Cajun restaurant for $20 you may be left underwhelmed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Two thumbs halfway up
FOOD	[ salad, mesclun, greens, bleu cheese ]	 The salad that came with was fresh mesclun greens, with a bleu cheese dressing that was chunky but bland
FOOD	[ O  ]	Midway thru our meal the jazz combo started up and sounded really good- definitely added to the atmosphere
FOOD	[ dessert, key lime pie ]	 For dessert we shared a slice of key lime pie
FOOD	[ O  ]	nice-tasting but no great shakes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It seemed to be thickened with gelatin and I suppose I prefer mine to be creamier, plus it was lacking in zing, but only mildly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Again, if your friend served it you'd rightfully congratulate them but for $6
FOOD	[ O  ]	50 it should be REALLY good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our server was very nice & professional
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Absolutely no complaints there
FOOD	[ O  ]	The nicest surprise came with the bill- only $70
FOOD	[ O  ]	and that included 5 drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	We have concluded that the next time we go we'll sit in the bar area and have drinks & apps
FOOD	[ wine ]	Crazy good food, excellent wine list, text book waitstaff
FOOD	[ date ]	Best atmosphere for date night!  Not good for kids
FOOD	[ O  ]	Make a reservation!!I don't care about "ambiance" or "decor" anymore
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I hit 40 and it doesn't matter to me anymore
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am more concerned about food
FOOD	[ O  ]	This food is awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	Go, it is incredible
FOOD	[ creole ]	Good food, I would call it New Orleans inspired rather then real creole cooking
FOOD	[ O  ]	That said I have never had bad service or bad food here
FOOD	[ date ]	It is really nice setting for a date or dinner out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not too spicy to scare the native Wisconsin's, including my wife
FOOD	[ raspberry, vinaigrette, salad dressing ]	The raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing had actual raspberries in it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just had to get that off my chest
FOOD	[ O  ]	The dressing surprised me and I'll go back for more than just that
FOOD	[ O  ]	We arrived on a Saturday night without a reservation
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I believe we took one of the last tables available until 9 or so
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would have opted for the bar if a table hadn't been available
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are a few high top tables that are seated in an area with live music
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The place is small and intimate
FOOD	[ date ]	It's the perfect place for a first date
FOOD	[ Lemon, Parmesan, Artichoke ]	We started with the Lemon Parmesan Artichoke Hearts which were nothing like I expected but were rich and flavorful
FOOD	[ appetizer, entrée ]	We weren't terribly hungry so I ordered and appetizer for my entrée and my boyfriend ordered the special
FOOD	[ Crawfish, Cheesecake, cheese, cheesecake ]	I tried the Crawfish Cheesecake, which, is basically a cheese ball in the shape of a piece of cheesecake
FOOD	[ appetizer, entrée ]	It was tasty and would make the perfect appetizer for a table of four but I wouldn't recommended as a main entrée
FOOD	[ O  ]	The special was the highlight of the meal
FOOD	[ scallops, shrimp, sweet potato, ravioli, pecans, lime, zucchini ]	I couldn't repeat it if my life depended on it, but I heard the words: scallops, shrimp and sweet potato  ravioli, pecans, lime something and zucchini
FOOD	[ O  ]	I forgot about the rest of the menu entirely
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm not doing the plate any justice with this, but please trust me, it was delicious
FOOD	[ vegetables, lime, sweet potato, ravioli ]	The vegetables were perfectly cooked with a lime (something, slightly spicy but still let the veggies shine) sauce that complimented the sweet potato ravioli
FOOD	[ scallops ]	Then there were scallops
FOOD	[ dishes ]	It was one of those dishes that I couldn't comprehend
FOOD	[ chef ]	All I know is I am anxious to try more of what this chef has to offer
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had a reservation at 7:15pm but when we arrived we were told we needed to wait 15 mins
FOOD	[ O  ]	That was annoying because that defeats the purpose of making a reservation
FOOD	[ O  ]	After that they found us a tiny table next to two large tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere was loud and cramped
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food however was great
FOOD	[ Bouillabaisse, base ]	I had the Bouillabaisse which felt like something from Louisiana because it had a thick earthy and spicy base
FOOD	[ seafood, fettuccine ]	The seafood was fresh and it came with homemade fettuccine
FOOD	[ O  ]	If the atmosphere had been better I would make myself a regular
FOOD	[ O  ]	In case you don't know, Louisianne's has started serving lunch, The good news is that it is inexpensive and delicious
FOOD	[ shrimp, bisque, chicken, romaine lettuce ]	I had a cup of shrimp bisque that was outstanding, and the grilled chicken po'boy tasted very fresh (the shredded romaine lettuce was much appreciated)
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only bad news is the general ambience of the upstairs lunch area 
FOOD	[ O  ]	rather dark and uninviting
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been to many restaurants in Middleton, but this is by far my favorite, and for a number of reasons
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	The food was excellent: I had a scallop and shrimp special
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was excellent: Seated promptly, waitress prompt, professional and spoke very clearly when it came to the specials
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere is unique: In the basement of a building, but you wouldn't think so when you're there
FOOD	[ Martini, raspberry, vinaigrette ]	Piano player, Great Martini! So when you're in Middleton, I suggest you stop here! (And Marnie is correct on the raspberry vinaigrette dressing with actual raspberries in it!!)Think upscale semi-authentic Luisiana with a romantic jazz overtone
FOOD	[ catfish ]	The food is really quite great, and I would never pass up the catfish
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was blackened and served with a sauce that was indescribable
FOOD	[ mushrooms, craw fish ]	For a starter I got the stuffed mushrooms with tasty craw fish filling
FOOD	[ O  ]	For desert
FOOD	[ O  ]	yeah that wasn't going to happen I was stuffed! The total bill for me was $37, which was reasonable considering the quality, ambience and how friendly the service was
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only missing star was that we had trouble finding our server as we were trying to pay our bill (it had already been dropped off but then he was gone!)Yelpers, you let me down! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was on my business trip to WI, and i was very excited about trying this restaurant!  boy, it was a huge disappointment
FOOD	[ crab, pastry, appetizer ]	have crab puff pastry as appetizer
FOOD	[ O  ]	 this was pretty decent dish
FOOD	[ pasty ]	 the puff pasty came out flaky, just how it should be
FOOD	[ crab, flavor, almond, crisps ]	 i could taste the crab flavor and almond crisps
FOOD	[ O  ]	it was very delicious
FOOD	[ lobster, bisque ]	I also ordered the lobster bisque
FOOD	[ bisque, bread ]	 bisque was on the salty side, but it was ok with the bread
FOOD	[ O  ]	 i wish i could have stopped my meal here
FOOD	[ raspberry, salad ]	Everyone on yelp was raving about their raspberry sauce on the house salad
FOOD	[ raspberry ]	 so i ordered that just to try the raspberry dressing, and huge disappointment
FOOD	[ O  ]	 it came with this layer of oil, and not enough "sauce"
FOOD	[ salad ]	 when i poured onto my salad it was just drenched in oil
FOOD	[ salad ]	 i didn't even eat the salad
FOOD	[ steak, meat, meat, rice ]	I had the steak special of the night and it was not good at all!  the meat was over cooked charred (i like my meat medium rare), the rice was undercooked, it was crunch, and the sauce was not good at all, it did not compliment the dish
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	  i only ate the shrimp
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	 it was $35 dish i only picked shrimp from it
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was soooooo slow that night
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 usually i enjoy my meals like these but that night i wanted just GET OUT OF THERE! the server took forever to bring out my dishes and i was getting really impatient
FOOD	[ O  ]	 for the amount of time at was at the table, she didn't come by to check up on me when i needed anything
FOOD	[ O  ]	 ugh
FOOD	[ O  ]	 never again
FOOD	[ O  ]	Was visiting Madison for Epic Training last year and came here with some coworkers
FOOD	[ O  ]	AWESOME!! Everything I had was delicious
FOOD	[ escargot ]	Tried escargot for the first time and it was wonderful
FOOD	[ savory, buttery, pastry ]	It was drenched in some savory buttery sauce and topped with a puff pastry
FOOD	[ O  ]	OMG
FOOD	[ crab ]	We also tried the crab puffs, they were also delicious
FOOD	[ bacon ]	Can't remember exactly what my entree was but it had bacon in it and was great too
FOOD	[ chocolate ]	The chocolate creme brulee was lovely
FOOD	[ O  ]	Back in Madison this week and will be going here tomorrow
FOOD	[ O  ]	We met another couple here for dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Love the ambiance, the smell, the courtesy of the staff
FOOD	[ all good ]	 It's all good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But the food was especially excellent
FOOD	[ Pecan, Catfish ]	 I ordered the Pecan Catfish
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Wow!!!  It was baked to perfection with darkened spices making it the perfect spiciness!!!  I loved it!  Veggies were fresh and crisp
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We had an excellent Pinot Grigio off the list
FOOD	[ tenderloin, cordon, bleu ]	 The others ordered tenderloin cordon bleu, which was raved about
FOOD	[ shrimp, pork ]	 There was a shrimp and pork loins special
FOOD	[ shrimp, spinach, rice, pasta ]	 That got thumbs up and then another shrimp dish that came on a bed of fresh spinach, which I think she wished she had rice or pasta instead, but she did like it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Love coming here and always recommend it to friends!Went again and it was AMAZING as usual
FOOD	[ escargot, crab, mushrooms ]	Went with a group of coworkers and we started out with escargot, crab puffs and stuffed mushrooms
FOOD	[ O  ]	YUM
FOOD	[ pork ]	For the entree's I had some pork masterpiece that was a featured dish and it was divine
FOOD	[ dessert, dark chocolate ]	For dessert I believe I had the dark chocolate creme brulee again
FOOD	[ Cajun, Martini ]	It was another great experience!If you like spicy drinks, try the Cajun Martini
FOOD	[ Cajun, Creole, cuisine, seafood ]	Lots of nice offerings in this cozy place, but Cajun/Creole cuisine is their forte, especially the seafood
FOOD	[ O  ]	Romantic, subterranean dining room unlike anything else you'll find in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hard to believe you're in beautiful downtown Middleton
FOOD	[ O  ]	if you're looking for a nice night out, keep looking
FOOD	[ O  ]	Be careful as you enter this place, the steps are steep as you are going in the basement
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, the carpet on the steps is very dirty, makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like
FOOD	[ O  ]	Four of us had dinner and overall the food is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service a little slow but very friendly
FOOD	[ conversation ]	The place is cramped and the music was loud, so it was difficult to have a conversation at the table
FOOD	[ O  ]	For the price of the meal you can do much better than this restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Awesome food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Definitely a good place to eat if it is your first time in Madison, WI
FOOD	[ O  ]	After hearing great reviews of Louisianne's, my husband and I decided to give it a try
FOOD	[ appetizers ]	 We went for appetizers and drinks rather than a full meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We sat at the bar and had excellent service by the bartender
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When we first arrived it wasn't very crowded, but after 10 minutes the bar was packed with people
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere was cozy and very welcoming with the live piano music
FOOD	[ crab, barbecue, shrimp, mushrooms, mussels ]	We had the "combination for 2" (crab puffs, barbecue shrimp, and stuffed mushrooms) and an order of the mussels for a total of $20
FOOD	[ mussels, cream sauce, bread ]	 The mussels were filling since they are in a cream sauce and served with yummy bread
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The combination plate was also excellent
FOOD	[ bottle, wine ]	 We were pleasantly full and enjoyed a nice bottle of wine for around $55
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is nice to see a high quality restaurant in Middleton!  We will definitely be back again!My Experience at Louisianne's was JUST OK
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have heard a lot of people talk about this place so I gave it a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went on a Friday night by myself and Sat at the Bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not really the type of place you can sit at the bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's very small, there is no television, and hardly any stools
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have live music on the weekends so the place was very loud
FOOD	[ O  ]	My Bartender was the only one behind the bar and the restaurant was pretty busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	So, as you can imagine my service was slow
FOOD	[ crab, pastry, BBQ, Shrimp, appetizer ]	I had the crab puff pastry and BBQ Shrimp as an appetizer
FOOD	[ Crab, Pastry ]	The Crab Pastry was very good
FOOD	[ BBQ, Shrimp ]	The BBQ Shrimp however were not
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	I was surprised they left the shell on the shrimp when they serve it
FOOD	[ Coffee, Chicken, jambalaya ]	For my main entree I had the Coffee Crusted Chicken and a half order of jambalaya
FOOD	[ jambalaya ]	They wouldn't let me have jambalaya as a side so I had to order half a plate of it If i wanted to try it
FOOD	[ Chicken ]	The Chicken was very moist and flavorful
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A lot sweeter than I had anticipated but good
FOOD	[ jambalaya ]	The jambalaya was very disappointing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, I would say it was just ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	We decided to sit at the bar and have our dinner there so we could listen to the piano player
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We waited a very long time to place a drink order, while watching the bartender stand and converse with other patrons
FOOD	[ O  ]	Then, it was an even longer wait to order dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	 (empty tables all over, so it wasn't due to being busy)  We weren't sure who was supposed to be taking care of us, the bartender or a waitress
FOOD	[ O  ]	  The bartender took our drink order after a long wait, and then after that, finally a waitress came by as asked,  "I guess you want to hear our specials?"  She took our order and we never saw her again
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Water came half way through our meal from the bartender
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our empty plates sat on our table for 25 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We felt very unattended to and almost a bother to the staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is excellent, however, and that just makes it tolerable to go there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is not an inexpensive place to eat, and it feels like a place where you should have excellent service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I got tired of trying to flag someone down all evening
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best place in the world, I cant endorse this shit enough
FOOD	[ all good ]	Best meal is as follows (although ive had other things here, all good, nothing touches this one)
FOOD	[ Crawfish, cheesecake ]	App: Crawfish cheesecake, sounds weird but is best of Wisconsin and Louisiana at once
FOOD	[ Cheese, crawfish ]	Cheese and crawfish
FOOD	[ O  ]	Done
FOOD	[ filet, filet ]	Entree: Their special filet, basically take everything that is great and put it on a filet
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing more to say
FOOD	[ Goat cheese, tomatoes ]	Goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes makes this
FOOD	[ Chocolate ]	Desert: Chocolate creme brulee, exactly as it sounds, would choke a homeless person for this (wont be missed)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Live music also sometimes
FOOD	[ O  ]	The moment you walk in you are transported into another time and place
FOOD	[ conversation ]	They had live music that fit the scene, made the atmosphere, and stayed background enough to have a conversation - check it out Tuesdays through Saturdays
FOOD	[ pecan, catfish, crawfish, BBQ ]	Order the pecan catfish with the crawfish BBQ on top, aka "Maria's special"
FOOD	[ pecans, catfish ]	It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish
FOOD	[ shrimp, fettuccine, shrimp, ham, mustard, cream sauce, soul food ]	The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse
FOOD	[ soup, soup, salad ]	If you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option
FOOD	[ soul food ]	Presentation was lacking but I don't think that's the point of soul food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service is sassy but whole-hearted
FOOD	[ O  ]	We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told "yeah, if you can find seats"
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	It isn't bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that's better
FOOD	[ rush ]	Maria, our bartender who's worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a great place to bring guests if you want to head off to a chill and unexpected place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Even better if you're prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed comfort food
FOOD	[ fruity, beverage ]	Try the Sazerac if you want a stiff, sweet drink and the Hurricane if you want a fruity, refreshing beverage that punches like a Long Island
FOOD	[ O  ]	The crowd here is mature and casually well-dressed
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had a wonderful experience at Louisianne's
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had reservations for dinner, but happened to be seated next to a rather loud group of men
FOOD	[ O  ]	Since the restaurant was completely full, we asked if we might be able to be seated in the bar area instead (which was much quieter)
FOOD	[ conversation ]	They quickly accomodated our request and we had an enjoyable conversation throughout dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was excellent and a musician softly played piano in the background
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was prompt, helpful, and friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	Terrific night out!Quiet, quaint and awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place is tucked away and underground
FOOD	[ O  ]	Piano man in the bar area playing jazz and lounge tunes
FOOD	[ escargot, wine, barracuda ]	Had escargot, wine and barracuda
FOOD	[ O  ]	At how many other places can you say you have all of those at once, AND underground
FOOD	[ O  ]	Zero! This place is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Priced well for what you get too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Couldn't finish it all
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food but not authentic and quite overpriced
FOOD	[ dessert ]	$38 for 1 entree and 1 dessert served by a snotty teenager? Really?Wow!  What a find!  Outside of the worn carpet on the stairs on the way down, this place is pretty awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very quaint, very, very quaint as you are literally underground
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I loved the feel of the place and the atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food did not disappointment either
FOOD	[ escargot ]	 The escargot were absolutely perfect, perfect, one of the best I have yet to have and I have had them in many different place
FOOD	[ Crayfish ]	 For my entree I went with the Crayfish etoufee and I am glad I did
FOOD	[ roux, crayfish, rice ]	 Excellent roux, plenty of crayfish, perfectly cooked rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Excellent overall
FOOD	[ dessert ]	 I would give it 5 starts but the dessert menu is very, very pedestrian and not inspired
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Would go back again though and again
FOOD	[ O  ]	Emeril Lagasse would have been disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was no Bam! during our visit to Louisianne's on 9/10/13
FOOD	[ wine, salad, crawfish, corn, chowder ]	The good: my wife's company, the wine list, the evening's piano player, the salad, and the crawfish corn chowder
FOOD	[ cream sauce, mussels ]	The bad: the thick, yellow, and salty cream sauce our mussels swam in and the worn out carpet on the stairs leading down to the restaurant
FOOD	[ entrée, shrimp, etouffee ]	The ugly:  The not so special blackened swordfish entrée with salty sides and the shrimp etouffee
FOOD	[ Cajun, rice, ketchup ]	 The classic Cajun dish was a generous amount of white rice with salty ketchup sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	 :-(Steps are a bit hard for us oldies but the food made up for it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Three of us, our son has been there before, thought mom and dad  should too
FOOD	[ mussels, crab, baskets, bread ]	Started with mussels, and crab puffs, both were so good, we went through  three baskets of bread with them
FOOD	[ raspberry, salad, soup ]	The raspberry dressing on salad was a bit tart, my only complaint, and one had soup
FOOD	[ duck, seafood, au gratin, etouffee ]	I had the duck , which was super good, one had the seafood au gratin, and one etouffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	we were all pleased and all took home left overs
FOOD	[ peanut butter, pie ]	We split a piece of the peanut butter pie
FOOD	[ coffee ]	and one had coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	we had a fun time drove 70 miles to get there
FOOD	[ O  ]	We enjoyed our visit to this restaurant however the waitress makes or breaks the evening
FOOD	[ O  ]	 More on that later
FOOD	[ O  ]	We started at the bar and the bar tender was super cool
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He made a fantastic Sazerac, one of the oldest cocktails in the USA
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The four of us admired the decor of the establishment in addition to the fun columns throughout that separated the patrons making it a more private experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This place is in a basement  and the columns separate everyone, different than all the open air structures these days
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had reservations and were seated about 10 minutes late however we were flexible
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waitress was not very friendly and did not smile
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She was making the motions
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Likely tired because it was Badger Homecoming Saturday and they were busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We were celebrating a birthday and asked if they did anything special
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She said I don't know and can check
FOOD	[ candle ]	 When she came back she said if you buy a desert, we can put a candle in it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What??  What restaurant does not do something for a birthday
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Oh well, move on
FOOD	[ O  ]	Each of us DID enjoy our meal
FOOD	[ Crawfish, Cheesecake, appetizer ]	 We had the Crawfish Cheesecake for appetizer
FOOD	[ cheesecake ]	 It was like a cheesecake?  Different and good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Two of us ordered separate specials and the other two ordered items off the menu
FOOD	[ leftovers ]	 None of us could finish and we enjoyed leftovers the next day
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food was rich and heavy, comfort food like
FOOD	[ diet ]	 If you are on a diet you'd need to be selective because no calories are spared here
FOOD	[ O  ]	In summary a happy waitress and a little birthday treat and this place would be through the roof!Stopped in for a drink on Monday night
FOOD	[ O  ]	A few observations:
FOOD	[ martini ]	  Drinks: My martini and cosmopolitans were delicious
FOOD	[ whisky ]	really enjoyed his whisky sour
FOOD	[ O  ]	Drinks were very good
FOOD	[ appetizer, crab ]	  Food: For an appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes
FOOD	[ Pecan, Catfish, seafood, bisque ]	I had the Pecan-Encrusted Catfish and the seafood bisque, and S
FOOD	[ pork, pork, sweet potato, soup ]	had the pork entree and the pork and sweet potato soup
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were both very impressed
FOOD	[ meat ]	I don't even eat meat, but I tried S
FOOD	[ pork ]	's pork entree and it was A M A Z I N G
FOOD	[ catfish ]	And I can't say enough good things about the catfish
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was so glad to have some left over, which I ate cold the next morning!  
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Service: Our server was so, so wonderful
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wish I could remember his name
FOOD	[ O  ]	Young guy, dark hair, thin
FOOD	[ O  ]	He recommended essentially all of our food to us, and we were happy with all of it
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bartender also came by and checked to make sure I liked my cosmo (I wasn't sure I'd like it)
FOOD	[ O  ]	She was quite friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	Will definitely go back the next time we are in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fun, warm, lively catacomb place, often with piano music
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is always really good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I want to hang out here more
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've brought business contacts and executives from my firm to Louisiannes'
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Always they have been impressed with the quality of the food, the ambiance of the facility and the attentiveness of the staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It compares well with top quality restaurants all over the world
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dined here recently with friends, and had an enjoyable experience, but not so great food
FOOD	[ O  ]	The pros:  
FOOD	[ O  ]	Inviting and cozy atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really friendly and attentive service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Excellent live music
FOOD	[ wine ]	Great cocktails, ok wine list
FOOD	[ O  ]	The cons:
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was boring and inconsistent
FOOD	[ artichoke, crab, appetizers ]	 We had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers
FOOD	[ seafood ]	 I didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Rather it was definitely of the frozen variety
FOOD	[ pastry ]	 And everything was made with frozen puff pastry
FOOD	[ escargot, pastry ]	 Even the escargot were covered with puff pastry
FOOD	[ cover, seafood, appetizers, recipes ]	I think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  Anyway, the appetizers reminded me of Pinterest recipes
FOOD	[ O  ]	A big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish
FOOD	[ chef ]	 That usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I think we experienced a little of both
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband and I both got the special
FOOD	[ pork, tenderloin, shrimp, mushrooms, sherry, potatoes ]	It was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Each component sounded good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck
FOOD	[ tenderloin, skewers ]	The tenderloin came on skewers
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	 What?  The shrimp were over cooked
FOOD	[ meat, shrimp, potatoes, mushrooms ]	 The meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms
FOOD	[ Cajun ]	 Everything was covered in some sort of Cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of Durkee or McCormick
FOOD	[ cornstarch, sherry ]	 Then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The whole thing tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck  and reheated
FOOD	[ filet ]	One of our companions ordered the filet
FOOD	[ steak ]	 She let us have a taste, and the steak was good
FOOD	[ blanc ]	 But it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce
FOOD	[ chef, blanc, steak, blanc, corn ]	 I'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter
FOOD	[ Dessert, dark chocolate ]	Dessert was a dark chocolate creme brûlée
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was dry and pedestrian
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really I think this place deserves 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I'll be generous
FOOD	[ base ]	 Lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place
FOOD	[ appetizers, pastry ]	 I would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and I could still enjoy them now that I know what to expect
FOOD	[ O  ]	But I would not return for dinner
FOOD	[ sauces, chef, cook ]	 If I'm going to spend $30 for an entree, I expect fresh ingredients, sauces made to order, and a chef that knows how to cook
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Madison has too many restaurants that offer far superior food to Lousiannes, and that's what will drive my future dining decisions
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just ok because my bar for New Orleans food is quite insurmountable!  But I give honest reviews
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Whoever is in the kitchen can season food like nobody's business!  It is great food
FOOD	[ Seafood, Bread Pudding, chef ]	 Seafood was not fresh though and they really do not have Bread Pudding on the menu!  That tells me that the chef is not from Louisiana at all
FOOD	[ Jambalaya ]	 Prices are too high, way to high!  Jambalaya for $20!  Ridiculous really
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A pot of that for 10 people cost $20
FOOD	[ O  ]	  But if you want great atmosphere and good food that is just seasoned well, go
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Drinks are reasonable and service is fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	We went here for my sister in law's birthday
FOOD	[ appetizers ]	I was anxious because my last time here was so unappealing, but this time was a whole different story! We ordered four appetizers to split and all of them were delicious
FOOD	[ steak ]	I had a steak which was cooked to perfection
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was excellent
FOOD	[ wine ]	The wine they recommended was delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	We split several desserts and they were delicious as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm still on the fence about the place but our last time there was good enough that I will give it another chance to make my final decision
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband and I went to Louisianne's recently after we sold our condo and got a Middleton Chamber of Commerce gift certificate from our real estate agent (Leslie Blum, she's great!)
FOOD	[ date ]	We wanted to use the opportunity to have a special date night and go somewhere a bit more upscale than we usually do
FOOD	[ O  ]	Having never been to Louisianne's in the 5 years that I've lived in Middleton, I suggested we try it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	I give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but
FOOD	[ O  ]	You walk into Louisianne's and immediately head downstairs
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's all stone and looks like you're walking into a cool cave or something
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's dark, but there's a lot of ambiance
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been to New Orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's romantic, fun, and not what you'd expect from the outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	I felt like we were on vacation while we were there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was awesome!
FOOD	[ O  ]	We went at about 8pm on a Friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	While we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band
FOOD	[ wine ]	I had red wine, and my husband had Jameson on the rocks
FOOD	[ Pecan, Crab, appetizer ]	We were seated and ordered the Pecan Crab Cakes as an appetizer
FOOD	[ crab ]	They were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other Midwestern crab cakes that I've had before
FOOD	[ bread, crab ]	They were heavy on bread and light on crab
FOOD	[ Bay ]	with a lot of Old Bay seasoning
FOOD	[ O  ]	Again, they weren't bad at all, but not spectacular
FOOD	[ wine ]	Next, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute)
FOOD	[ choice, soup, salad, soup ]	 We were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup
FOOD	[ shrimp, corn, chowder, tomato, pulled pork, chilli ]	They had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which I got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had)
FOOD	[ soup ]	Both soups were fantastic! Definitely 5 stars for the soup
FOOD	[ soup, salad, bread ]	I'll take a minute here to comment that I enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart
FOOD	[ O  ]	(It reminds me of dining in Wisconsin supper clubs as a child)
FOOD	[ bread, bread, butter ]	By the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Onto the entrees! My husband absolutely LOVED his dish
FOOD	[ O  ]	He claims that it was possibly "the best thing I've ever had in a restaurant"
FOOD	[ Coffee, Chicken, fettuccine, coffee, bone, chicken, breast, hazelnut, ricotta ]	He chose the Coffee Roasted Chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a "hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce"
FOOD	[ spinach ]	I think there was spinach in it too
FOOD	[ pasta, al dente, chicken ]	The pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy
FOOD	[ peanut ]	It almost reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead
FOOD	[ O  ]	Although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not
FOOD	[ essence ]	It had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	The reason that Louisianne's is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which I felt was very underwhelming
FOOD	[ pasta ]	We don't eat pasta at home for health reasons, so I usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat
FOOD	[ shrimp, fettuccine, pasta, ham ]	I chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic New Orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham)
FOOD	[ shrimp, pasta ]	The shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse
FOOD	[ mushrooms ]	The dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous
FOOD	[ O  ]	probably the best part
FOOD	[ pasta, Creole, mustard, cream sauce ]	However, the pasta was supposed to have a "Creole mustard cream sauce", and it didn't really
FOOD	[ flavor ]	The sauce was very light, and had little flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was kind of sad, because I was really hoping to be wowed and I wasn't
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was adequate
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way
FOOD	[ O  ]	Summary: I'd definitely return
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think Lousianne's Etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on Yelp, seems to be consistency
FOOD	[ O  ]	Some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh
FOOD	[ O  ]	The major problem with this is that Louisianne's  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally
FOOD	[ O  ]	so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won't return for a second chance
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think this explains why the Yelp reviews for Louisianne's are so polarized
FOOD	[ O  ]	Came here based upon Yelp reviews
FOOD	[ cajun ]	I was expecting a dive place, like all the other cajun places I've been to, but that's not this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dark mood lighting in the basement of an old house
FOOD	[ O  ]	Small menu and very pricey
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not what I was expecting at all
FOOD	[ catfish, beer ]	I ordered the blackened catfish and a beer
FOOD	[ catfish, jambalaya ]	The catfish and the jambalaya  were the two least expensive entrees in the low $20's per each
FOOD	[ mashed potatoes, catfish ]	Pleasantly surprised by the large portion of grilled vegies and handmade mashed potatoes that came with the catfish
FOOD	[ flavor ]	Amazing flavor and worth the money
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu didn't mention the sides included
FOOD	[ jambalaya ]	Friend ordered the jambalaya and let me try it
FOOD	[ catfish ]	The blackened catfish was way better
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I love the ambiance, the food, and the drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's even better when they have a lounge singer in the background
FOOD	[ O  ]	I order it for my employees occasionally
FOOD	[ pizza ]	 The pizza is what you expect, nothing better than OK
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They throw on an extra $1
FOOD	[ O  ]	50 for delivery charge and the drivers tell us that most goes directly to the managers pockets
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That Sucks
FOOD	[ O  ]	Gross! I generally love Papa Johns, but this one is lacking in all areas
FOOD	[ O  ]	I ordered PJs for lunch and once it finally arrived (1 hour later), it was luke warm and soggy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Apart from that, the staff lacks any work ethic or customer service
FOOD	[ O  ]	The three people I dealt with were all rude and careless
FOOD	[ O  ]	Initially, they ended up giving me a $5 credit
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ha! As if I would order again anyway
FOOD	[ O  ]	A 5 star gem!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I echo Jenny D's comment on the hash brown
FOOD	[ O  ]	Super crispy exterior and moist fluffy inside - it's a piece of art
FOOD	[ egg ]	 My friend and I enjoyed the generous portion of scramble egg ($7
FOOD	[ blueberry, pancake ]	50), and 2 layers blueberry pancake ($5
FOOD	[ O  ]	00)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything tasted like "mom's food
FOOD	[ O  ]	" Made fresh to order, and very satisfying
FOOD	[ O  ]	No frou-frou typical Middleton gimmick
FOOD	[ O  ]	The basic decore, and the down to earth service - the perfect spot to watch regulars enjoy the hearty breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious!  Great service, good prices and tasty food
FOOD	[ burrito ]	 Echo what previous posts say about the hashbrowns!  Breakfast burrito is really good and giganticThree Sisters is one of the best breakfast joints in the Madison area
FOOD	[ hash browns, omelettes ]	For me the two best things are the hash browns and the omelettes
FOOD	[ hash browns ]	Like all the other raters, I think their hash browns are perfect
FOOD	[ omelettes ]	Their omelettes are not the fluffy kind
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are flat-cooked, sheet-style, folded around all the good stuff you specify
FOOD	[ omelette ]	This is the kind of omelette I prefer, and for this style theirs is one of the best I've had
FOOD	[ O  ]	Beyond that, the service is super unpretentious and friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their cinnamon rolls are big, soft, and without the density I favor
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their pancakes are more spongy than I like
FOOD	[ O  ]	But you should still try them, it's just a matter of style, and everything here is done with sincerity and consistency
FOOD	[ O  ]	You will find something you like enough to keep going back, especially since their prices are so reasonable
FOOD	[ O  ]	In our opinion Three Sisters will appeal to certain people and not to others
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Some will like it's laid back, small town, dinette atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nothing fancy, good food, large portions
FOOD	[ coffee ]	  Others will also enjoy the good food but will be displeased with the lack of space, mismatched dinning wear,  less than average coffee, barely toasted toast and the "greasy spoon" environment of the building
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ O  ]	Some will see 4 or five stars, go there and say "dead on
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Loved the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	"   Others will wonder how someone gave them more than three
FOOD	[ coffee ]	We went back and didn't enjoy our food as much as we did the last time and the coffee was not very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Also we thought the prices were higher
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ O  ]	Anyway, love it or leave it, it is a three star restaurant in our book
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 breakfast spot, i gave three because of the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The breakfast is kinda greasy/oily, which i usually like, but this was a bit much though
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would rate this place higher if they lowered the prices and moved people thru like a diner should
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice place for a Sunday morning cozy breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	No frills, just good food simply made
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pancakes are huge and delicious
FOOD	[ egg ]	They have build your own omelets and egg beaters are available by request
FOOD	[ Oatmeal ]	Oatmeal was very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	My whole breakfast was $11
FOOD	[ menus ]	One funny thing is that it seemed like they only have six menus for the whole restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had four in our party and had to wait for a table of six to order before we could get a menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall I liked the simple atmosphere cheap prices and good food
FOOD	[ coffee, eggs ]	Great coffee and some of the best eggs I've ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's sort of a hole in the wall, but that adds to the ambiance
FOOD	[ O  ]	Super nice wait staff, too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had breakfast at Three Sisters a few days ago while at Middleton for a meeting
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very "down home" place
FOOD	[ Mexican, dishes ]	 Mexican flavorful dishes along with midwest-country favorites
FOOD	[ eggs, Mexican, hash browns ]	 I had some eggs and the Mexican hash browns
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great way to start the morning
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Friendly staff knew the customers and welcomed new-comers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Patrons here ranged from seniors in high school to senior citizens
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very congenial
FOOD	[ breakfasts, eggs, scrambled eggs ]	I had one of the best breakfasts I have ever had here! This must be a Wisconsin thing, but their scramble (eggs with various other ingredients-like an omelet by scrambled eggs) was delish
FOOD	[ O  ]	I noticed the scramble at other places too
FOOD	[ cheese ]	I had the Denver scramble, which had the perfect amount of cheese on top
FOOD	[ O  ]	The hashbrowns were pretty good too
FOOD	[ pancake ]	I also had one pancake
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very good
FOOD	[ conversation ]	The staff were all very chatty and engaging everyone in conversation
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was fast
FOOD	[ O  ]	After reading a few reviews on Yelp, I guess I was expecting a little larger restaurant, but this is in a small place, basically a diner
FOOD	[ O  ]	FYI, they are closed on Monday, I heard them tell someone
FOOD	[ O  ]	100% traditional all-american diner breakfast experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I like trying new breakfast spots with my kids but this place remains a favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Friendly, chatty waitresses who dote on the kids like they were their own grandkids
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Inexpensive
FOOD	[ Oatmeal ]	 Oatmeal for when you want to eat somewhat healthy (this place ain't for health food
FOOD	[ butter ]	)  Omelet was good, probably because it tasted like it was cooked in butter
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good pancakes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Take your check to the counter / bar when you want to pay
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Cash only
FOOD	[ salad, cheeses ]	Cobb salad was large and had great cheeses, meats and veges
FOOD	[ onion rings, batter ]	 I tried the onion rings which had a slightly sweet batter
FOOD	[ onion, flavor ]	 It really perked up the onion flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Worth the money
FOOD	[ O  ]	, breakfast or lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Oh, I was warned to only order a stack of pancakes and
FOOD	[ O  ]	if I'd like, half orders are also acceptable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Next visit is breakfast to use the advice
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was so disappointed after reading all of the reviews
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Firstly, breakfast stops at 11:00 on weekdays and noon on the weekends, NOTE THAT because when we showed up today after my husbands late night shift the night before they would not serve us breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	CASH OR CHECK ONLY
FOOD	[ menus ]	Worth noting, both menus are pretty slim, but breakfast is larger than lunch
FOOD	[ fried chicken ]	They were out of the fried chicken "dinner" (you mean lunch, since they were only open till 2, right?)
FOOD	[ patty, melt, fish, sandwich, onion rings ]	We ended up ordering the patty melt, ok, fish sandwich, subpar, and onion rings, good but not $3 good
FOOD	[ Sandwiches, chips, fries ]	Sandwiches come with chips, not fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But was definitely not the pancakes that everyone else was raving about that I was craving
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 The coffee was sting but a bit bitter
FOOD	[ O  ]	The total was just under $20 without tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decor is old, doesn't bother me too much, but looking at the filthy carpets, it was disgusting and I was a bit afraid since I was wearing flat sandals
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Before I forget to mention it, the place smells like smoke when you first walk in, I was completely expecting to see ashtrays at the booths
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are a regular
FOOD	[ O  ]	If not, plan on spending about three times too much there
FOOD	[ O  ]	We waited for about 5 minutes for our waitress ( one of the owners) to shout sit where you want
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We grabbed a table
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband had to take a work call, but had given me his order
FOOD	[ O  ]	After waiting 10 minutes, I had to flag our waitress down to place our orders, and she looked at me shocked that I would want something to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	Trying to get the check out of her was terrible
FOOD	[ O  ]	By 12:15 the lunch regulars had started coming in, so she was chatting about a recent wedding, showings hem the wedding pictures, talking about what the place looked like, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	by 12:30 I had out cash on the end of the table hoping to move things along
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She walked past us three times without making eye contact, finally, I put my arm out and asked for the check, which had not been prepared, wait for another 5 minutes while she served more regulars and FINALLY she got back to using we were out of there by 12:50
FOOD	[ O  ]	In short, we will never return
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is expensive for what you get, food is unremarkable, serve is terrible, and it seemed like it could use a food service inspection because it was pretty dirty
FOOD	[ O  ]	I visited this time for breakfast on the weekend
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Holy cats is it ever so busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I tried the 2,2,2,2 meal
FOOD	[ eggs, bacon, sausage, blueberry ]	2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, 2 pancakes- I chose blueberry
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 The pancakes had great flavor and the berries where awesome - very fresh
FOOD	[ corned beef ]	 We also tried the corned beef hash
FOOD	[ corned beef, onion ]	 It's just hashbrowns with corned beef chunks and large onion slices
FOOD	[ Pancake, Cafe ]	 It's ok, just not as good as Pancake Cafe's
FOOD	[ biscuits, gravy ]	I will be back to try their biscuits and gravy (it sold out
FOOD	[ mexican ]	sounds like a winner) and their mexican hashbrowns
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is as good as all the reviews say!   It is a nice little diner with great service
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I was greated immediately upon entering
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I sat down and was asked right away what I wanted to drink
FOOD	[ coffee ]	  The coffee was hot and fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I had the 2,2,2,2 and it was very good
FOOD	[ grill ]	  Served hot off the grill
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I will be back and would recommend to anyone to try
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a great place to go for a good, cheap breakfast that will fill you up
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You seat yourself, but the staff is still at your table taking your drink orders quickly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The staff is always super friendly and all of the breakfast items I've tried have been great
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 Even better, they keep your coffee filled even when it's busy! :-)  Only thing to know ahead of time is they only accept cash and there is no atm in the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love this place! It's family owned and operated (still!) and is old-timey like most places aren't anymore! For a yummy feel-good blast from the past meet me at Three Sisters! :-)Gr8 place! Service decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food portions are plentiful! My daughter had a couple of pancakes that  were the size of a hubcap!
FOOD	[ O  ]	She said they were very tasty!  I had the country scramble
FOOD	[ O  ]	Loved it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices were good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice local joint
FOOD	[ chicken, dumplings ]	Recommend!!I love this place! The chicken and dumplings I had today were delicious and the service was amazing and super friendly as usual! For a comfortable dining experience, visit 3 sisters! :-)The scene reminds me of
FOOD	[ O  ]	a garage
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A garage with fairly rude servers and overstuffed patrons with nothing to say
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We waited 
FOOD	[ O  ]	And waited
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The menu had the basics- no problem there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We waited
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh, everything is made to order that is why it takes so long
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seriously that is what we were told
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Other reviewers say "it is like their mothers used to make"
FOOD	[ cook ]	 Sorry to hear your mom was a lousy cook
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And she must've been a grouch
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Yes the food is pretty bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Why people go here I can't understand
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I gave it three visits before passing judgement
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The verdict - AVOID
FOOD	[ O  ]	If your looking for Bar food in the city of Middleton this is the place to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have excellent burgers
FOOD	[ fries ]	And honestly their fries are some of the best I have had
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	Ive been there only twice and have never had anything else on the menu other than the cheeseburger but it was excellent as far as burgers go
FOOD	[ cheese steak ]	My friend got the cheese steak
FOOD	[ O  ]	which looked awesome too
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	Worth checking out if your looking for a burger/sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	and prices are quite good
FOOD	[ Fish ]	Quick review: Stopped in for lunch today, with the intention of sampling their Friday Fish special
FOOD	[ cod, fries, slaw ]	$7 gets you 2 pieces of deep fried cod, fries, slaw, roll, and soda
FOOD	[ Fish ]	 Fish was solid - nicely done, especially for the price and speed
FOOD	[ O  ]	Detailed review:
FOOD	[ Bowl ]	I'd never visited the Middleton Sport Bowl prior to today, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We arrived exactly at noon, parked, and made our way to the bar, where we found two seats and were promptly greeted by a bartender
FOOD	[ cod, fries, slaw ]	We both ordered the lunch special - 2 piece deep fried cod plate with fries, slaw, tartar, dinner roll, and soda
FOOD	[ bowl, popcorn ]	 The bartender took our order and came back with a complimentary bowl of popcorn, which was a nice surprise
FOOD	[ fish, fries ]	Plates arrived about 10 minutes later - the fish was appropriately sized, as were the fries - no imbalance, and portions were fair
FOOD	[ fish, beer, batter ]	The fish itself had a flavorful beer batter that was a little thicker than what you'll typically find at most places, but it was delicious and I welcomed the extra crunch
FOOD	[ fish, grease ]	Inside, the fish itself was a tad watery with just a hint of grease - not anything outrageous, but just enough to sense that it was there
FOOD	[ Flavor, fish, batter ]	 Flavor of the fish was incredibly mild; the batter stole some of its thunder
FOOD	[ fries ]	The fries were excellent - battered-style and straight cut
FOOD	[ slaw ]	 I'm told the slaw and tartar were "average
FOOD	[ O  ]	"  Dinner roll was hard and dry
FOOD	[ O  ]	Total lunch bill for two: $14
FOOD	[ O  ]	64, and we were in-and-out within 35 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Totally acceptable and a good lunch, all things considered
FOOD	[ Bowl ]	Middleton Sport Bowl = NEUTRAL
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food = 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	75 to 3 stars (average; not bad, not spectacular)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service = 3
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars (prompt and friendly)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value = 4 stars 
FOOD	[ O  ]	MISC = 3 stars (actually seemed to be a nice bowling alley/bar)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Summary: Not a win, nor a fail
FOOD	[ fish, sandwiches ]	 I'd go back for the fish at lunch, and will definitely be back to sample other foods - the sandwiches looked really good
FOOD	[ Bowl ]	Middleton Sport Bowl is kind of a mixed bag
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'll briefly break down how I gauge them (I've been many times, both before and after the renovation)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Facility:  Great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with TVs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments
FOOD	[ game ]	Cost:  Fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, I think it's around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm sure it's hiked up otherwise
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food:  It's typical bar food
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	 They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you'd see at an alley
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nothing to write home about but if you're in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won't go wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There's a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you're there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Everytime I've gone in I've tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like "I'd like to get a lane, there's 3 of us and we all need shoes" etc, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	 These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn't help either party move the process along
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's really irritating because I've gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it's always been like that
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don't share the same attitude
FOOD	[ Bowl ]	Personally I'm more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out
FOOD	[ curds ]	Hadn't been to the SportBowl for quite some time, but visited for lunch today, thanks to a hot-tip about the burgers and curds
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Some co-workers had been raving about them, and ever the skeptic, I had to verify the claims for myself
FOOD	[ O  ]	Arrived at around noon on a Friday, and copped-a-squat at one of the numerous bar stools
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A very friendly bartender walked over, menu in hand, and asked what I'd like to drink
FOOD	[ iced tea ]	 I ordered an iced tea, and browsed the menu
FOOD	[ Tea, cheese, curds, bacon, cheeseburger, pepper ]	Tea arrived within a minute, and I placed my order: cheese curds and a bacon cheeseburger, with pepper jack, cooked medium, please
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bartender left with my order, and I passed the time by watching the Big-10 basketball tournament and gazing around at the large and expansive bar area
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food arrived, and it looked spectacular
FOOD	[ curds ]	 Let's start with the curds
FOOD	[ curds ]	Friends, I know curds
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Believe me
FOOD	[ curds ]	 You can read all you want about the "awwwesome" and "amaaaaaazing" curds from the Old Fashioned - those suck
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Point blank - they suck
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They're greasy, they're usually over-cooked, and they're bland
FOOD	[ curds ]	What "saves" the OF's curds is their tiger sauce
FOOD	[ curd ]	 And I don't care who you are, but to borrow from another reviewer, "Sauce does not a good curd make" (sorry Doctress, I saw your line in the El Tigre review, and had to borrow it)
FOOD	[ Bowl, curds ]	The Sport Bowl's curds are DEFINITELY homemade
FOOD	[ curds, cracker ]	 You can tell simply by looking at them that these offerings begin as simple, unbreaded curds, are battered and rolled in a breading (probably Cornflake or cracker?), and then carefully deep-fried
FOOD	[ O  ]	And the result speaks for itself
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They are EXCELLENT
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So good (see photo)
FOOD	[ curds, batter ]	 The bartender confirmed they take 'bare' curds, and give 'em the batter/breading treatment, all to order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I believe him
FOOD	[ curds ]	 You need to believe me - these are the best curds you'll find outside of Green County
FOOD	[ O  ]	The burger was equally excellent, and I'm going to go on record to say the burgers here are without a doubt in the Top 3 for Madison-area burgers
FOOD	[ beef ]	Knoche's Market supplies the beef
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's hand-pattied and grilled to perfection
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I asked for medium and received a true medium burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The burger wasn't dry and it wasn't greasy
FOOD	[ flavor, grill ]	 It had a delicious smokey, charcoaled flavor that instantly brought back memories of mid-summer grill-nights back home
FOOD	[ bacon, pork, icing, cow, cake, beef, cake ]	The pepperjack had a nice kick, and the bacon served as pork-icing on the cow cake (I'd have said 'beef cake' but that's a bit over-the-top)
FOOD	[ bun ]	The bun was light and airy - very fresh tasting and lightly toasted
FOOD	[ bun ]	The burger was so good that I'd have no problem eating it completely plain - burger and bun alone
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That's saying something
FOOD	[ O  ]	Middleton SportBowl = WIN
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food = 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	75 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value = 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service = 4 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	MISC = 3
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars (not super inviting environment, but it's a bar/bowling alley)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Summary:
FOOD	[ curds ]	- Best curds in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Top 3 burger in Madison-area
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Go
FOOD	[ O  ]	Let's start this review at a 3-star (A-OK = not good/not bad) rating
FOOD	[ game ]	+1 star: They have a Badger Bus for home-game weekends
FOOD	[ game ]	It costs $5, and includes a coupon for a free drink when you get back from the game
FOOD	[ O  ]	+1 star: The bowling alley looks nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a small space, but clean-looking
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't know prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll give them the +1 for appearances
FOOD	[ O  ]	-2 stars: The food is terrible
FOOD	[ O  ]	TERRIBLE
FOOD	[ game, boneless, Buffalo chicken wings ]	After the WIS v UTEP game, the wife ordered boneless Buffalo chicken wings
FOOD	[ flavor, BUFFALO, chicken, flavor, frying ]	They came out deep fried and hard, with almost no flavor -- there was NO BUFFALO SAUCE ON THE WINGS! (We think the B-sauce might have been fried onto the chicken, but, if so, the flavor was lost in frying)
FOOD	[ O  ]	-1 star: The service was lacking
FOOD	[ game ]	Following the game, with all 50+ people who had just come back on the Badger Bus, there were only 2 servers, and they were also the bartenders! Service was slow, haphazard, and careless -- the guy never once asked how the food was, nor did he ever actually stop at the table except long enough to take our order
FOOD	[ O  ]	Drinks were dropped on the fly, the food was all but thrown as he whizzed by 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, 2 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll go back for the Badger Bus and the bowling, but I will NEVER eat there again
FOOD	[ O  ]	Like to stop here on Fridays,as your first drink is free
FOOD	[ bun ]	That's right not 2 for 1, free! Had a burger on last visit which was quite possibly the best I have ever had! Fresh,hand patted,with a great bun
FOOD	[ O  ]	Craving another as we speak
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service OK
FOOD	[ O  ]	I eat lunch here about 3 times a week
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have a different special each day of the week Monday through Friday
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Always friendly!  I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a place to eat some lunch
FOOD	[ Bowl ]	A co-worker of ours just got a promotion/transfer, and as part of his farewell/send-off, he requested we join him for lunch at the Sport Bowl
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't expand much from my previous review(s)
FOOD	[ curds ]	the burgers are still in the Top 3 for Madison, the curds are in the Top 2
FOOD	[ fries, curds ]	 This is primarily a burger/fries/curds place; everyone in our party ordered burgers (save for me and my boss - we both ordered salads), and every burger was perfectly cooked and earned rave reviews
FOOD	[ iceberg lettuce ]	The salads aren't anything special; processed meats, iceberg lettuce, mediocre veggies
FOOD	[ diet ]	 I would've loved to have one of those succulent burgers, but I'm in the zone with my diet/exercise these days
FOOD	[ iced tea ]	Lunch specials include a free soda/iced tea as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not reviewing this place as a bowling alley, since I don't have the expertise to know what constitutes a good bowling experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If the shoes fit, the ball rolls down the lane, and the pins fall down, it's fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	This review is all about the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	 To start, the cheese curds are required eating
FOOD	[ cheddar cheese, bread ]	 I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	 Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point
FOOD	[ O  ]	When you think bar food, you think burgers
FOOD	[ Bowl ]	 And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well
FOOD	[ fries, bucks ]	 At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks
FOOD	[ grease ]	 I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful "contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained" feeling afterwards
FOOD	[ O  ]	A quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge
FOOD	[ meatballs ]	 Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect
FOOD	[ patty, melt, bread ]	 The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard
FOOD	[ pizza, Pizza ]	 The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish
FOOD	[ fish ]	 The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price
FOOD	[ cheesesteak ]	 The "Philly" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me
FOOD	[ Bowl, grease ]	The best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But it will probably cost more than your entire meal here
FOOD	[ fish ]	Great burgers, sad fish
FOOD	[ O  ]	We do a weekly managers meeting and everyone takes turns choosing the location
FOOD	[ Bowl ]	One of the guys choose the Madison Sports Bowl
FOOD	[ fish, onion rings, fish ]	I ordered the fish, when the food came to the table I saw beautiful hand pattied burgers, hand dipped onion rings, then came my fish
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sad flat, boring, breading right off the Sysco truck
FOOD	[ O  ]	What a disappointment
FOOD	[ onion rings ]	Today we made a second trip and I ordered the burger and onion rings
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm very happy!Ever since their renovation, this place has knocked it out of the park
FOOD	[ beer, game ]	 This is THE place to go for a cold beer after a softball game
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Hungry?  No problem!  Their menu is extensive and everything that I've had has been excellent
FOOD	[ pizza, pizza ]	I especially recommend the pizza - you don't expect great pizza from a bowling alley, but they do a great job
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's a favorite of ours
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Their burgers are top notch as well
FOOD	[ gyros ]	 I haven't had the gyros, but a friend of mine raves about them
FOOD	[ corn ]	 The kids menu is great - my little guy destroyed their mini corn dogs
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff is very friendly and helpful
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The owners put a lot of hard work and time into this place, and it shows
FOOD	[ beat ]	 On a cool summer evening, you can't beat sitting out on the patio with a cold one
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of our first restaurant visits when we moved here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We have since learned to avoid any restaurant a local recommends
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Menu was full of bland comfort food
FOOD	[ chicken, dumplings, steak ]	 Wife had chicken and dumplings that tasted like they came out of a can  My steak was tough and flavorless
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Restaurant has been in the same location for about 100 years and it shows, it's badly in need of a remodel
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Entire place smelled like vomit and was dirty
FOOD	[ feet ]	 I could smell the bathrooms ten feet away and when I had to visit they were even worse, layer over layer of dirt
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Where's the health inspector
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service was extremely poor, especially considering we were the only people in the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I guess the highschooler that was serving us was too busy talking on her cell phone to help us
FOOD	[ O  ]	Used to be a classic
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, it's come under new ownership and everything has suffered across the board
FOOD	[ O  ]	Average service, below average food and terrible atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	Needs a shot in the arm because it'd be a shame to see a classic Wisconsin supper club disappear
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wanted to like it, I really did
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it
FOOD	[ O  ]	First off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in
FOOD	[ O  ]	When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment
FOOD	[ dishes ]	If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved
FOOD	[ cook ]	It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly
FOOD	[ beef, Moutarde ]	The BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde
FOOD	[ french onion soup, salad ]	His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking
FOOD	[ O  ]	When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED
FOOD	[ beef, fork ]	I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy
FOOD	[ O  ]	FAT
FOOD	[ Fatty, fatty ]	Fatty fatty fatness
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ewww
FOOD	[ O  ]	I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver
FOOD	[ O  ]	All right
FOOD	[ fatty, meat ]	Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish
FOOD	[ O  ]	A girl can move on
FOOD	[ O  ]	MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous
FOOD	[ fatty ]	I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty
FOOD	[ meat ]	You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat
FOOD	[ O  ]	*Sigh* I'm done
FOOD	[ potato ]	I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato
FOOD	[ O  ]	To give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish)
FOOD	[ dessert ]	Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want
FOOD	[ O  ]	He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think
FOOD	[ O  ]	Over all, it just wasn't enjoyable
FOOD	[ O  ]	I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't
FOOD	[ O  ]	Average at best
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par
FOOD	[ date, gourmet ]	I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! I realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but I've had MUCH better casual dining experiences
FOOD	[ O  ]	for less money!2-stars may be a bit generous if we're just measuring food quality
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quick-n-dirty review: Stamm House features a lot of character, history, and good service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Unfortunately, that's about all it has to offer, unless you enjoy food that is extremely greasy, and of mediocre quality
FOOD	[ fish, fish ]	Detailed review: Our fish fry crew decided to give Stamm House a try after we'd read good things about it on a fairly well known fish fry review website
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Normally, those guys (the reviewers) are pretty spot on, but they've completely missed the mark when it comes to the Stamm House
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not even close to being a top-10 place, no way, no how
FOOD	[ O  ]	We sauntered in to the Stamm House at around 5:45 on Friday night and were shocked to find the place darned-near empty
FOOD	[ Cow ]	 The bartender greeted us immediately - very friendly guy - we ordered a couple of New Glarus Nakeds and a Spotted Cow
FOOD	[ O  ]	 After downing the first round, we went to order a refill, and whoops - Naked went empty, and there wasn't any more left
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Drat
FOOD	[ O  ]	After downing a second round of beers (Cows all around this time), it dawned on us that we probably needed to inquire about a table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So, we wandered upstairs where a friendly lady told us she'd have an opening at around 6:45 or 7:00
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Odd, the place was empty
FOOD	[ O  ]	but, we took it and went back downstairs
FOOD	[ cheese, curds, onion rings ]	We ordered some cheese curds and the onion rings
FOOD	[ curds, curds ]	 The bartender warned us ahead of time that the curds were "standard-from-the-bag" curds, but said the rings were hand-battered and delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They arrived quickly, and once again, the bartender was spot-on with his description
FOOD	[ curds, curds ]	The curds were Sysco curds and were not cooked well at all
FOOD	[ curds, grease ]	 I don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn't eat them
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Disgusting
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And the ranch dipping sauce was like water
FOOD	[ O  ]	you know what they say about oil and water
FOOD	[ grease ]	The rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It really made for a bad first impression
FOOD	[ grease ]	 So, we ordered some Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery
FOOD	[ hash browns ]	our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size
FOOD	[ Fish, hash browns ]	 Fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns
FOOD	[ fish ]	 First bite of the fish?  UGH - it tasted awful
FOOD	[ flavor, fish ]	 Extremely fishy flavor (and I love fish)
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 Think "stinky NJ ocean shore line flavor" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable
FOOD	[ fish ]	 No sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  
FOOD	[ lemon, fish, ketchup ]	So, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup
FOOD	[ fish ]	 That helped a bit, but it still wasn't an enjoyable fish fry
FOOD	[ fish ]	 The fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If only it weren't so obscenely fishy
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ Hash browns ]	Hash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Total bill for three with a round or two of drinks was $45-ish
FOOD	[ O  ]	Stamm House = FAIL
FOOD	[ grease, grease, fish ]	Food: 1 star (grease, grease everywhere; horrible fish fry)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service: 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value: 3 stars
FOOD	[ fish ]	Summary: waaaaay too greasy + waaaaaay too fishy fish = fail
FOOD	[ onion rings, appetizer, onion, appetizers ]	Let me start right out by saying that this review has nothing to do with  food!!!  (Unless you count the onion rings appetizer which tasted like most deep-fried onion ring appetizers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Some of you know me now as someone who LOVES tradition and history and preservation and stuff-like-that
FOOD	[ O  ]	So we came here for the tradition (great old supper club from the 40's), the history (an1847 stagecoach inn, later a stop on the Underground Railway, and a Speakeasy circa Prohibition) and the preservation (it's hard to keep a 150-year old lady going in style)
FOOD	[ fish ]	So we came to DRINK and PLAY, in other words, on a busy Friday night, in spite of, or because of, the fish fry
FOOD	[ fish ]	 We grabbed some stools but found ourselves giving up our seats to some lovely ladies who were waiting to be seated for the fish fry
FOOD	[ fish ]	 (Like I said, we weren't here for the food, but I gotta wonder why the fish fry was JAM PACKED CONSTANTLY
FOOD	[ wine, cellar, apron, impromptu ]	After bugging the extremely convivial bartender about the history of the place, and begging to see the "wine cellar"/slave-holding-tank in the basement, he tossed his apron at someone and announced an impromptu "tour"
FOOD	[ O  ]	 WOW!
FOOD	[ cellar ]	It was cool to say the least, imagining the terrified slaves packed into the "secret" cellar, with its curved brick walls
FOOD	[ conversation ]	 So we took turns squeezing in and out, then returned to the bar and proceeded to enjoy tons of conversation with the locals
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So, I'm a fan!Overall it was a nice supper club
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You have the bar area then you go upstairs to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Drinks were good
FOOD	[ fish ]	The fish was good
FOOD	[ fish ]	 I would have liked to see a baked option on the fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The family style all you can eat was good
FOOD	[ French fries ]	 French fries were good too (all you can eat)
FOOD	[ fish ]	Not the best fish I have ever had, but above average
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The place was quite so you could talk without yelling which was nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	FYI - this place is closed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is for sale
FOOD	[ O  ]	4 stars for Hardee's ?!?  It's no Culver's by a long shot but that Thick Burger was damn tasty !   I don't know if the restaurant was clean but the drive thru service was good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like this place because it usually isn't very crowded
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There's a Culver's down the street that always has about five times the business as this place
FOOD	[ fries ]	 The burgers are really good, the best fast-food burgers in my opinion (yes, better than Culvers, gasp), and the fries are excellent as well
FOOD	[ fries ]	 The best part is that if you get there at any time other than lunchtime, you get fresh fries
FOOD	[ mayo, mayo ]	The only thing I don't like is how they put mayo on some of their burgers, but they never have a problem with making one without mayo
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service is always friendly, but sometimes a little slow
FOOD	[ chicken ]	 Oh yeah, you should also stay away from the chicken strips
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They're bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decor here is awesome, with wood paneling straight out of the 80's and cheap plastic booths
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There's even a sterile-looking wall clock on one of the walls
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you want to reminisce about a time before fast-food restaurants tried to be all trendy and hip, you should stop in at Hardee's
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Middleton Hardee's just renovated
FOOD	[ color ]	 They got rid of the wood paneling and switched to a trendy red/black color scheme
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is much more pleasing to the eye, but I was still sad when I found out
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Now I go to Perkin's for my old-person decor fix
FOOD	[ fast food ]	 Thankfully, the outside of the restaurant still looks like your typical run-down fast food eatery!
FOOD	[ fried chicken ]	Also, the new fresh-fried chicken strips they've introduced are orders of magnitude better than the old ones, which tasted like they had been fried in a factory, frozen, and then microwaved for five seconds before being served
FOOD	[ fast food, chicken ]	 Nothing in fast food is ever fresh, but these new chicken strips do a passable impersonation of it
FOOD	[ tomato, fries, diet ]	Okay, my review sums it all up in a text that I sent to my boyfriend several hours after eating a Frisco Burger w/o tomato, small order of curly fries and a small diet coke
FOOD	[ O  ]	Text message:
FOOD	[ O  ]	"Don't tell anyone but I ate at Hardee's today and it was like real restaurant quality
FOOD	[ O  ]	Well just the food part
FOOD	[ O  ]	I didn't eat it all b/c 1) I couldn't and 2) I wanted some for later
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was driving while eating it and I kept saying out loud how good the burger was
FOOD	[ O  ]	Mind you, I was totally alone
FOOD	[ O  ]	And I didn't go in the restaurant but it looked clean from the drive-thru window and that woman who took my order did a better than average job
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was kind of put off by their prices but it was totally worth every penny!these guys are super friendly
FOOD	[ mushroom ]	the food was made perfectly! mushroom and Swiss
FOOD	[ O  ]	yum
FOOD	[ O  ]	they play nice music and its very cleanGrade: C-
FOOD	[ fish, fillets ]	Triangle-shaped fish fillets served on Styrofoam plates
FOOD	[ beer ]	Good greasy Hushpuppies and cold beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good service and prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	this place is not bad, in fact i rather liked it
FOOD	[ O  ]	the prices are good and the food is decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	i rather go here than a big chain where i would pay more for similar food
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's a bar area and a section with tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	Definitely a mixed crowd-young singles, EMTs on a break, middle aged singles, older couples, and families
FOOD	[ O  ]	kinda cool
FOOD	[ O  ]	the Village Green offers new glarus and cap brewery on tap, as well as other stuff i cant remember
FOOD	[ cheeseburger, fries ]	We were there on a Saturday night and my husband got the special, double cheeseburger with fries for $6
FOOD	[ O  ]	95
FOOD	[ O  ]	I just got the regular burger, and it was about $3
FOOD	[ O  ]	50
FOOD	[ O  ]	the burgers looked like the frozen variety, but they were kinda tasty, really
FOOD	[ O  ]	schlitz in a can $2 all the time, big screen tv
FOOD	[ O  ]	for me a downside was that the place was a little smoky, i guess there isn't a smoking ban in this city yet, however, it is possible to sit outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	the server was pleasant and efficient
FOOD	[ O  ]	cash onlyClassic neighborhood bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good strong drinks at good prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think the bar food is great (try the spudsters!)Some part of me recognizes that the Village Green might be a bit of a hole in the wall, but I've been going there since before I could walk so I have to love it
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	 It's where "the locals" go for a burger and cheese curds
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Whether you graduated from MHS in 2004 or in 1969, you'll probably run into someone you know from high school
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love this place because it hasn't changed a bit - the food is still awesome, they still don't take credit cards, and they still play nothing but football on the big screen tv up front
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wandered in to the Village Green after a hard day at the office
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Sat at the bar, quizzed the bartender about a few things and ultimately tried a bunch of the "specialties
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service?  Top notch
FOOD	[ beat, glasses ]	 The bartender was ON - never missed a beat, never left our glasses empty, and was very helpful
FOOD	[ O  ]	 5+ stars
FOOD	[ Ale ]	Drinks? Limited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items: Great Lakes Ale and Esthers Best were two that stood out as fun and not what you'd normally find at a more mainstream location
FOOD	[ Lemon, lemonade, vodka ]	 They also have daily drink specials - we tried the Lemon Smash (hand squeezed (with each drink) lemonade + vodka) and the Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Both were great
FOOD	[ chili ]	Food? We tried the famous chili - meaty, slightly spicy, and delish
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means
FOOD	[ beef, soup, meat ]	 We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality
FOOD	[ chicken ]	For our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty
FOOD	[ tomatoes, onions ]	 Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet)
FOOD	[ salad ]	 The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I'd get it again in a heartbeat!  
FOOD	[ chicken ]	Our dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce
FOOD	[ vinegar ]	 The result?  Wow - tasty, especially if you're a fan of vinegar-based wing sauce that packs a bit of a kick
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Really, really good
FOOD	[ O  ]	So, we'll definitely be back - I'm becoming a huge fan of the "local" places, and the Village Green is definitely a "local" place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I can't wait to try a burger or to enjoy some of their other drink specials
FOOD	[ O  ]	Village Green = WIN
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food = 3
FOOD	[ O  ]	75 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service = 5 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value = 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	75 stars (a bit pricey; $35 for 2 with drinks)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall = 3
FOOD	[ fish ]	75 - 4 stars (atmosphere, service, general vibe, selection = big boost)Yummy food! Great service! Family friendly atmosphere! Great Prices!Went there with the family for Friday which in Wisconsin means fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was nice to seeing the cooks preparing your food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Who knows what those cooks do in those kitchens
FOOD	[ Fish, batter ]	Fish was good, batter was a little heavy
FOOD	[ potato, fries ]	 Only potato option was fries-boo
FOOD	[ O  ]	Otherwise, good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No complaints
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quaint little townie spot downtown Middleton
FOOD	[ beer ]	 Nice divey spot for a beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Inside smells like old people and moth balls, but they have outdoor seating
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The menu is very bar foodish, but they make it very well
FOOD	[ chili, fish, sandwich ]	 The chili wasn't the best, but it was good, and the fish sandwich was quite good
FOOD	[ chili, fish, sandwich ]	 That's right, I had chili and a fish sandwich, a strange combo
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been living in Middleton for about 9 months now, and I'm giving the Village Green five stars for being excellent at what it is: a small, local bar with great service and interesting patrons
FOOD	[ O  ]	To us, the Village Green is the place we go when we want to get out of the house for a drink and some company
FOOD	[ O  ]	Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you
FOOD	[ sandwiches, Dip ]	They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays)
FOOD	[ O  ]	All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean
FOOD	[ beer, Lite ]	They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types
FOOD	[ chat ]	Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open past midnight - it's just not that sort of bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	Go across the street to Hody for late-night drinking
FOOD	[ O  ]	Any other time though, I promise you'll find the company much more enjoyable at Village Green
FOOD	[ O  ]	First and foremost, their burgers are INCREDIBLE and that is reason enough to go check it out! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would actually give this place a 3
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 if that were possible
FOOD	[ O  ]	I docked it because it has a limited menu with mostly fried food, not many healthy dining options, but then again I'm not sure why anyone would go there for anything other than a burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is also definitely a dive, the bathrooms are a little scary, but the burger ranks right up there with the best in the Madison area
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sloppy Joe was pretty bland
FOOD	[ chili, flavor ]	I had the spicy chili, good flavor
FOOD	[ Fries ]	Fries were good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Def will go back and try burgers there
FOOD	[ O  ]	After the hype about their burgers I was really looking forward to trying the food here
FOOD	[ O  ]	The meh: The hushpuppies were 1/2 way decent, but nothing extraordinary
FOOD	[ O  ]	Edible
FOOD	[ honey ]	No honey offered with them though
FOOD	[ O  ]	The ugh: With the all of the acclaim their burgers get, you would think that they were doing something special here
FOOD	[ O  ]	They aren't
FOOD	[ O  ]	The burgers are frozen patties and look like they're right from Sysco
FOOD	[ O  ]	The reason that people are probably saying they're so good is because the patties aren't cooked within an inch of a briquette
FOOD	[ O  ]	Normally I would say that's a good thing, but when you're making me a burger from an unknown origin handled by who knows how many people
FOOD	[ beef, patty ]	needless to say, medium rare frozen beef patty is doesn't = amazing burger in my book
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't say that I would visit again
FOOD	[ beef ]	There are far too many amazing hamburgers on the west side made with real beef from local butchers to waste my time with this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	UPDATE: I've spoken with a couple of people that are thinking it may be a fluke that I ended up with frozen patties the time I was there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Apparently they have a machine there that they make their patties with

FOOD	[ O  ]	the Village Green is the idealistic neighborhood tap

FOOD	[ O  ]	 We've been back a few times now and love going with friends for a casual Friday night
FOOD	[ fish ]	 Great specials (love the Friday fish
FOOD	[ O  ]	but be prepared to eat only fried food)
FOOD	[ sausage ]	 My all-time favorite is their summer sausage reuben
FOOD	[ Fries ]	if you love reubens you cannot go wrong with this jewel!  Fries are always hot and fresh and service is always friendly
FOOD	[ dishes, beer ]	 One of Middleton's best kept local secrets!Want a burger?  Go here!  Price is a little on the high side for some of their dishes, but if your looking for a casual place to grab a beer and burger, this is the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	A bit awkward
FOOD	[ snack ]	Kind of like the snack bar at a summer camp
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very nice people in there and the drinks were good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Decor was lacking, but I cant fault it much for that
FOOD	[ Burrito ]	Hard to pass up the Road Kill Burrito
FOOD	[ sauces ]	 Ask for the bucket of sauces
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was as good as when I tried it ten years ago as it was last week
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't think much has changed around here in 30 years, but that is definitely part of the charm
FOOD	[ fish ]	 I have heard the fish fry is good, but I have never been there on a Friday night
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lunch crowd has a lot of regular guys, quick and friendly service, prompt and hot food

FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food, nice tap selection
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very comfy
FOOD	[ O  ]	"The Green" has the best burgers in the Madison area

FOOD	[ O  ]	 They know what they are doing here and they are doing it good
FOOD	[ Nachos ]	 The Nachos are pretty awesome too
FOOD	[ tortillas, chips ]	 They deep fry tortillas for the chips
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you can, get a spot at the bar

FOOD	[ fish, fish ]	I don't eat fish, but some of my friends and my girlfriend do, and they like the fish fry on Fridays
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	 I'll stick to my cheeseburger
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Village Green is a Wisconsin bar with Packer memorabilia, formica tables and mismatched chairs, and better than average food
FOOD	[ fries, mushrooms ]	 It wasn't the best burger I've ever had and the fries and mushrooms were frozen
FOOD	[ corned beef, sandwich ]	 The corned beef sandwich was fresh but not fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	  But it was adequate and I'd return if I had a hankering for WI bar food
FOOD	[ O  ]	I felt like I'd been here before the minute I walked in - the menu and atmosphere were indistinguishable from other taverns I'd been to
FOOD	[ beer ]	 Their tap beer selection was good and its obvious they do a lot of business
FOOD	[ fish, beer, batter, fish ]	 If this is what you are looking for, they do it well!Excellent Friday fish fry!  Their beer batter fish is crisp,tasty, and not at all greasy
FOOD	[ hush puppies, fries ]	 The hush puppies were equally good, but the fries could use some work
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our waiter had a great personality and not only provided good service, but interesting trivia such as the fact that our meal had been prepared by Steve Miller's son (of The Steve Miller Band fame)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Reasonable prices, nice-sized portions, good service, and really good food--we'll be back!This place is awesome for what it is, a very friendly, neighborhood tavern
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is mostly fried and greasy but served with a little slice of love
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The specials are excellent and the value is top notch
FOOD	[ game ]	 Want to watch a game?  They have a few big TV's and are very accommodating
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are looking for high-end, posh dinning, this isn't your place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Madison has plenty of excellent choices in that department
FOOD	[ fries ]	 This place is homey and will serve you a solid burger and fries, with a starter of wings and variety of homemade soups for a pretty good price
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Come in and see these guys, they do it right
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great old school bar

FOOD	[ O  ]	 I wish they were open on Sundays too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its Friday night
FOOD	[ O  ]	cold and snowing
FOOD	[ O  ]	  What  is there to do? Head to the Village Green
FOOD	[ fish, ice, beer ]	  Enjoy the Friday fish fry and yes, an ice cold beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	  So lets start with the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	  It was very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I walked in at 5:06pm, was immediatly greeted and placed my order within a few minutes
FOOD	[ cod, french fries, hush puppies, coleslaw ]	       By 5:10pm I had 3 pieces of hot cod, french fries, 2 hush puppies and coleslaw
FOOD	[ O  ]	  The meal was better then expected and exceeded expectations
FOOD	[ O  ]	  The Village Green is a traditional Wisconsin Tavern that has great service
FOOD	[ beer ]	  I am looking forward to next Friday already!   I forgot to mention that they have a decent selection of on tap beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I tried the Winter Skull, pretty smooth!As others have already stated, I am rating this for what it is
FOOD	[ grill ]	a bar and grill, not a fancy 5-Diamond restaurant
FOOD	[ bacon, cheese, onions, french fries ]	I chose the bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and some french fries; absolutely delicious!  The burger is juicy and tasty
FOOD	[ ketchup, mustard, measure ]	I add some ketchup and mustard for good measure!  I sat in the bar area and had no problem getting service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The bartender is quick and attentive; the place was packed and one bartender had the bar crowd and the sitting area crowd
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I also ordered a Capital Winter on tap and it was poured perfectly!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have been in the area for three years and I consistently return to the Village Green as the best burger in the area
FOOD	[ bun ]	 I like the simplicity of the burger and bun
FOOD	[ meat, bacon, Sloppy Joes, Burrito ]	 The meat is delicious and the bacon adds that extra umph!!!!  Also they have nightly specials and I try to target Tuesday (Sloppy Joes) and Thursday (Road Kill Burrito)
FOOD	[ O  ]	both are great!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quick, consistent service, very tasty food and a friendly atmosphere; you cannot go wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been told they are known for their burgers, but their menu hosts a smattering of great bar foods
FOOD	[ Chicken, chili, seafood, gumbo, fish, chicken ]	Chicken wings, chili, seafood gumbo, fish, chicken in many forms, salads, and even some kids menu options
FOOD	[ cheese, curds, fish ]	 I decided to try their cheese curds (great!) and the friday fish fry
FOOD	[ hush puppies ]	 The hush puppies were too dry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'd recommend staying away from those
FOOD	[ fish ]	 The fish was good, but the next visit will be their burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're looking for a super fancy place, keep looking
FOOD	[ O  ]	this is your typical neighborhood tavern and it made me feel like I was back home in the Milwaukee area
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The best burgers in Madison
FOOD	[ fries, cheese, curds ]	hands down!  Good fries and cheese curds too
FOOD	[ dishes ]	they had a number of other dishes that sounded yummy too
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Super friendly staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We will definitely be back!The Village Green, I call it the VG for very good
FOOD	[ fries, cheese, curds ]	If you want a good greasy burger, crispy golden fries, non-greasy crunchy cheese curds, a nice selection of local brews on tap and fast friendly service this place is for you
FOOD	[ conference ]	This past weekend I was visiting Madison for a conference and ate at the Nitty Gritty with a group of 50 people
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was outstanding, friendly, attentive and quick
FOOD	[ glass ]	My water glass was never empty
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant has two levels with high ceilings and polished wood floors
FOOD	[ O  ]	A relaxed, clean atmosphere
FOOD	[ chicken, spinach dip ]	My table of 5 started with chicken strips, good and standard and spinach dip
FOOD	[ spinach dip, chips, celery, broccoli, cauliflower ]	The spinach dip is excellent, extra cheesy and hot served with chips, and fresh veggies- carrots, celery, broccoli and cauliflower
FOOD	[ fries ]	We all had burgers and fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	The burger was enormous I could only eat 1/2
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pretty good deal for around $6
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are in the area I recommend  the Nitty Gritty
FOOD	[ O  ]	A fun place to go for your birthday!  The wait staff is very friendly, easy-going, and kept checking on us
FOOD	[ Garlic, Teriyaki ]	 We had the Garlic burger and the Teriyaki burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	very yummy
FOOD	[ fries, fries ]	fries and pub fries are recommended
FOOD	[ beer, ice cream sundae ]	Nice to go for your birthday mug with unlimited beer/soda and the world's smallest ice cream sundae
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'll definitely go every year
FOOD	[ Fish ]	My first Fish Fry!  Yum
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And they make Arnold Palmers too!Watched the Packers here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Popular place for birthdays
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seemed like a draft of smoke came in when the door opened which was annoying
FOOD	[ O  ]	But overall a great environment
FOOD	[ O  ]	Maybe I missed something about this place, but after three tries, I just had to stop going back hoping I would finally feel the magic
FOOD	[ O  ]	The burgers are okay, but there are better ones in Madison
FOOD	[ chicken, sandwich, pretzel, bun, bun ]	The last time we were there, my son's chicken sandwich was overcooked, and they charged more money since he got it on a pretzel bun instead of the regular bun
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our burgers were unremarkable - not that flavorful or moist
FOOD	[ buffalo wings ]	The buffalo wings were greasy and actually not hot when we got them
FOOD	[ O  ]	And the last night we were there, a Friday at about 6:00, the place was full and the service was terrible
FOOD	[ dishes ]	As in waiting over fifteen minutes after I had piled all the dirty dishes at the end of the table as a hint that we were way done before the server came by wondering if we wanted anything else
FOOD	[ appetizers, sandwiches ]	And somehow, with four people, no alcoholic drinks, two appetizers, and four sandwiches, our bill was over $70
FOOD	[ O  ]	That's US dollars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Before the tip
FOOD	[ cheese ]	They charge extra for everything - ranch on the side, cheese on a burger - everything
FOOD	[ O  ]	For a really marginal meal and lousy service, that was way too much money
FOOD	[ O  ]	You know I hate to do this but I have to agree with Vickey M
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The Gritty burgers are something of an acquired taste
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They taste good to me because they bring back memories of the 70s
FOOD	[ flavor ]	  They do have good flavor but are somewhat messy and there are better burgers than the Gritty
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bar was more fun when it was small
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We don't go there anymore because often it is so busy that we can't really enjoy the place like we used to
FOOD	[ O  ]	But I would stop by again for the Gritty Burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	I recently learned that the gritty burger recipe was changed in the 80s sometime?   Correct me if I'm wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	  We did think the burger was somewhat different from what we remember
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Now we know why
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The old burger that everyone loved was way better than the new one
FOOD	[ O  ]	We think they need to enlarge the place and bring back the original burger if they still have the recipe
FOOD	[ bomb ]	  The sauce was the bomb
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tonight the fam got Nitty Gritty takeout, and for me it was a disappointment
FOOD	[ chicken ]	I had suggested the NG because I'd been craving chicken tenders all day
FOOD	[ chicken, pepper, flavor ]	In the past, NG's chicken appeared to be hand-breaded and had a decent dose of pepper in the breading to give it some flavor
FOOD	[ chicken ]	Tonight's offering was a step above cafeteria chicken strips
FOOD	[ chicken ]	Flat, factory-breaded, flavorless, and all of them with that gross gooey translucent strip of whatever you get in cheap chicken
FOOD	[ fries ]	Making it worse was the addition of soggy fries and not-as-good-as-I-remembered Gritty sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	For almost $10, I'm calling this a total bust
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yet another restaurant I can cross off the list for upping price and cutting quality
FOOD	[ O  ]	This Nitty Gritty I would have to say is not as good as the downtown madison one and the sole reason is that it is way too small for how many people generally go there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also their dartboard and such is not well placed and becomes a nuisance when trying to return to the bar for another drink
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have good drink specials and its still got that classic nitty atmosphere but not great
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was in town for training at Epic
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wanted a bar with good food to watch baseball playoffs
FOOD	[ O  ]	I remembered the Nitty Gritty near campus from a previous visit, so tried the one in Middleton close to my hotel
FOOD	[ BBQ, Pulled Pork, sandwich ]	BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich - Outstanding!
FOOD	[ Waffle, fries ]	Waffle fries - Excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	Capital Amber draft - very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Atmosphere - Fun
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service - great
FOOD	[ O  ]	Too bad it wasn't my birthday
FOOD	[ O  ]	It seemed that everyone there had a birthday celebration in the group
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That's their thing
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'll go back, even if it's not my birthday
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their prices have gone up
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The quality has gone down
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Medium-well burger was well done (crispy, burnt)
FOOD	[ bucks, cheese, curd ]	 23 bucks for one gritty burger, one small cheese curd order and two draft beers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Wow, times have changed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They just lost my future business
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Judging by how few people were there, it looks like they may be losing a lot of business
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Such a shame, because it used to be fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	Meh
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place doesn't suck, but it's not very good
FOOD	[ beer ]	The only time you should really go is if it's your birthday so you can have free beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their menu is incredibly boring and extremely overpriced for the quality of ingredients that they use
FOOD	[ Nachos ]	On my most recent visit, our table got an order of Nachos to share
FOOD	[ chicken ]	With chicken, it cost $12
FOOD	[ O  ]	50
FOOD	[ tortilla, chips, cheese, chicken ]	It was nothing more than a plate of tortilla chips covered in Day-Glo orange cheese, jalapeno slices, and gray (eww) dried out chicken pieces
FOOD	[ beef ]	I also had a burger as my entree, and the beef tasted a little funky, like it had been reheated in a microwave--almost metallic
FOOD	[ salad, salad ]	My dining partner had a salad that she seemed to enjoy, but it's hard to mess up a simple green salad
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sadly, I've been here more often than I'd like to admit because they host Team Trivia on Tuesday nights
FOOD	[ O  ]	My boyfriend and I decided to start going somewhere else for trivia when we recently won and got a $40 gift certificate and weren't excited to use it because it meant we'd have to try to consume more of their crappy food
FOOD	[ O  ]	We spent it mostly on booze instead
FOOD	[ pork, sandwich, coleslaw ]	Delicious pork sandwich with coleslaw and very attentive service at modest prices in a rustic atmosphereThis place is great for birthdays
FOOD	[ glass, beer, juice, ice cream sundae ]	You get your glass mug filled with beer, soda, or juice with unlimited refills, while also getting a very small ice cream sundae at the end
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The burgers were very tasty and cooked as requested
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our server was very good and on top of refills and food came out of the kitchen pretty quick
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I liked the atmosphere in the dining area with tv's mounted throughout the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The bar area was not huge, but I could see it being a fun atmosphere later on in the night
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nuh uh
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nope
FOOD	[ O  ]	No no no
FOOD	[ O  ]	My daughter wanted to eat here for her birthday this year, having eaten at the one downtown successfully 4 years ago
FOOD	[ O  ]	Her birthday, her pick
FOOD	[ O  ]	Plus, she delights in the free mug of soda and balloon
FOOD	[ O  ]	She's a birthday sell-out and I think that must be how they suck you in
FOOD	[ O  ]	But, I digress
FOOD	[ glasses ]	Our order took an aggravatingly long time to arrive and our glasses remained empty after having drunk their contents while waiting
FOOD	[ game ]	There was a Packers game on and many of the wait staff were watching that
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't know if that was the hold up, but it was a bit irritating
FOOD	[ O  ]	When our meals finally arrived, my children discovered that the insides of their burgers were very pink
FOOD	[ O  ]	Waaaaay too pink for medium well, which they ordered
FOOD	[ hamburger ]	It was scary pink and super soft--like raw hamburger generally is
FOOD	[ O  ]	When I told our waiter about it, he was completely uninterested in helping fix the situation, and instead, argued with me about it for quite a while, finally saying, "That's what medium well looks like" in a tone that suggested that I was simply too stupid to know the difference
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finally I convinced him to humor me and take them back to be cooked through
FOOD	[ O  ]	He did so with a smidgen of contempt
FOOD	[ O  ]	As a side-note, my husband's burger was to be well done and was also pink, though not raw
FOOD	[ O  ]	Still no drink refills
FOOD	[ O  ]	No one offered a discount, a refund, a free soda while we waited, and especially not an apology
FOOD	[ O  ]	Obviously we won't be back
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	Ok, I heard from someone that Culver's had cheese curds
FOOD	[ cheese, curd ]	 (For those that don't know what a cheese curd is then ready this wiki article
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Don't worry I didn't know about them until I came to Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	 http://en
FOOD	[ O  ]	wikipedia
FOOD	[ Cheese, curds, curds ]	org/wiki/Cheese_curds)    So, when class got out early today, I decided that I needed to hunt for the elusive curds
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The easiest place to come was here
FOOD	[ curds, curds, curds, mozzarella ]	 But the curds are not the traditional curds, they were fried curds, like fried mozzarella
FOOD	[ snack ]	  A nice snack but not exactly was I was looking for 
FOOD	[ O  ]	on with the search
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars because 
FOOD	[ O  ]	1) it's Culver's and 
FOOD	[ cheese, curd ]	2) I refuse to let an LA resident (Tracy G) weigh down the supreme awesomeness that is Culver's based on her misunderstanding of cheese curd availability!Recycling in the restaurant
FOOD	[ sweet potato, fries, cheese, cheeseburger ]	 Our favorites are concrete shakes, the new sweet potato fries, grilled cheese, and cheeseburger
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very nice & friendly staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food was brought out quick
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Clean tables & restrooms
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food here is pretty much just like every other Culver's that I've ever been to
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's a chain, it has to be that way, so I don't really care
FOOD	[ cheese, curds, appetite, mayo ]	 The cheese curds are good in theory but their deep-fried heavenliness will vanquish your appetite pretty quickly, and then you won't be able to enjoy your greasy, cheesy, mayo-ey burger
FOOD	[ french fries ]	 Venturing away from the french fries is generally not a good idea
FOOD	[ pork tenderloin sandwich ]	The pork tenderloin sandwich is godlike
FOOD	[ tenderloin, bun ]	 The tenderloin is about twice as big as the bun that it's served on
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I feel like this is my own little secret since I've never seen anybody else ordering or eating it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Now the cat is out of the bag
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place recently did a renovation with a bunch of fake stone veneers and trendy curvy decor all over the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not bad, but I preferred the previous "nursing home meets McDonalds" vibe they had going
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They did manage to improve the layout slightly so that the soda dispenser is no longer right in the way of where people are waiting for their to-go orders
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It still gets pretty nuts at lunchtime though, so prepare to drive around the parking lot a few times looking for a place
FOOD	[ O  ]	One personal complaint I have with this place is I keep seeing old high school classmates working there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I pretend not to recognize them
FOOD	[ grease, butter, bread ]	I don't get it? I don't understand the fascination with Culvers? The food costs twice that of Wend's, Mc D's, Hardys, or Burger King, and with the doubling of the price it has double of the grease! They figured if you "butter toast" the buns you can serve stale bread and know one will know
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you order through the drive through you will be given a number and have to wait
FOOD	[ cook ]	Worst yet if you order a sundae you will get it first while you wait 15-20 minutes for you order to cook
FOOD	[ soup ]	Just in time for you to enjoy you sundae as soup
FOOD	[ ice cream, custard ]	Worst yet it is not ice cream it is "custard"
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	A frank'en food knock off of real ice cream
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh, and the fry's are soggy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't get it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Amongst my friend I'm apparently the only one that doesn't like this place?I love Culver's
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is fact
FOOD	[ O  ]	The thing that makes this Culver's different from the rest is that they had offered Wisconsin-fare, i
FOOD	[ Cheese, Soup ]	Wisconsin Cheese Soup
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wow, was this fantastic! The facility was clean, the employees were very happy and the food was very tasty!
FOOD	[ fast food ]	I'm glad that I can find quality fast-food, yet sit-down food across the nation!This is the best Culver's around because it is company owned (not franchised) and they use this store for training new managers, so everyone really knows their job and they are not miserable like most fast food employees
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And the food is almost always perfect
FOOD	[ bomb ]	This place is the bomb
FOOD	[ cheese, curds, melt ]	  Fresh burgers and the cheese curds are melt in your mouth perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	  The service is way above average and the restaurant is very clean
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I have enjoyed Culvers for years when we would visit on vacation
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Now we live here and we make a weekly visit to Culvers for dinner
FOOD	[ custard ]	  Of course you have to top the meal off with a custard
FOOD	[ fast food, fast food ]	  It is a fast food restaurant but it is way above what you would expect from a fast food restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Affordable, fast, and yummy! 
FOOD	[ chocolate, custard ]	Loved their Deluxe burger and chocolate frozen custard! 
FOOD	[ custard, ice cream ]	Choco frozen custard was soo smooth and creamy--you won't be able to look at ice cream the same! 
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	their cheese curds are pretty good too!The best Italian food in town, hands down
FOOD	[ sausage, basil ]	 They've got homemade sausage that's the best I've ever had, and they use fresh basil like there's no tomorrow
FOOD	[ pasta, prawns, pancetta ]	 My girlfriend's favorite is the pasta with giant prawns and pancetta
FOOD	[ O  ]	  This place is too good for Madison
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	I always crave Vin Santo, even though I haven't been there for years, I still have family back in Middleton, and every time we visit, we have a feast! I truly believe it offers some of the best home made Italian food in the midwest
FOOD	[ O  ]	A real hidden Gem
FOOD	[ hospitality ]	And considering multiple family members have worked there in the past, we know what a tight ship is run, and how genuine the owners are in their hospitality and insistence for high quality in everything they do
FOOD	[ tiramisu, dessert, Vin Santo ]	Please give it a try, and DO NOT pass on the breadpudding/tiramisu for dessert : ) be warned that it may ruin you for life on anyone else's recipe!Vin Santo rules!  
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a great casual restaurant that is owned/operated a local couple
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She can often be found running the front of the house and he is in the kitchen
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Their passion is reflected in the quality of their food and the high level of service provided to their guests
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their food is some of the best in the area - they focus on Northern Italian cusine
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's simple, fresh, and delicious!  They always offer a variety of specials
FOOD	[ O  ]	The portions are huge!  You definitely feel like you are getting your money's worth
FOOD	[ leftovers ]	 I have never left without leftovers
FOOD	[ Scampi, shrimp, garlic, pancetta, scallions, white wine, cream sauce, linguini ]	My favorite dish is the Scampi Gabriella (jumbo shrimp sauteed with garlic, pancetta, and scallions finished with a white wine cream sauce served over linguini)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Awesome!!This is easily the best Italian food in the Madison area
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	 I've never had a bad meal (or even a bad bite!) on a visit to Vin Santo
FOOD	[ seafood, fettucini, seafood, tiramisu ]	The seafood fettucini is really heavy on the seafood (they're not trying to stiff their customers!) and they basically serve BRICKS of incredible tiramisu
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Everything tastes so fresh and home-made and they offer a much more interesting menu than most "Italian" restaurants in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm so happy that this locally-owned business has found great success - they have lots of regulars (like I used to be!) who keep coming back for the delicious food, big servings, friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	 Vin Santo is a MUST for me when I'm in the area
FOOD	[ appetizer, mussels, bread pudding ]	try their appetizer of steamed mussels and their excellent bread pudding (huge portion)
FOOD	[ bread ]	 Their bread was mediocre
FOOD	[ seafood, pasta ]	I couldn't remember what seafood pasta I ordered; it was satisfactory but not a surprise
FOOD	[ cook ]	The manager is very nice while the cook has a funny attitude
FOOD	[ bread pudding ]	We went there craving for bread pudding at 5p right after they opened
FOOD	[ chef ]	As the waitress submitted our order to the chef, he said, "we don't serve desert at 5
FOOD	[ tea ]	" Anyway, we got our sweet tooth satisfied along with some tea for an hr
FOOD	[ O  ]	I give 4 stars for the atmosphere and the menu selection
FOOD	[ dishes ]	Delicious!! Huge portions of very authentic Italian dishes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All entrees, salads, apps and desserts can easily be shared
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very cozy and wonderful servers
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	 Can't wait to go back!I've now eaten twice at Vin Santo
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful
FOOD	[ wine, dishes ]	 The wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance
FOOD	[ O  ]	 With all of these elements going for it, I have high expectations for the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when I've dined there
FOOD	[ bruschetta, mussels, appetizers ]	I have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers
FOOD	[ bruschetta, flavor ]	 The bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites
FOOD	[ tomatoes, pesto ]	 The tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto
FOOD	[ bread ]	 The fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior
FOOD	[ mussels, bread, broth, mussels ]	 The mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don't come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten
FOOD	[ bread ]	 Our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce
FOOD	[ Ravioli, Vin Santo ]	Two of my companions ordered the Ravioli al Vin Santo; both liked and finished the dish
FOOD	[ Fettucini, meat, anchovies ]	 It is one of four vegetarian options (the Fettucini alla Putenesca does not list meat, but I've never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom I dined
FOOD	[ Insalata, anchovies ]	 One companion ordered the Insalata di Caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative
FOOD	[ Lasagna, chicken ]	 A fourth companion ordered the Lasagna del Giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite
FOOD	[ Fettucini ]	 A fifth companion ordered the Fettucini alla Putenesca, of which I tried a bite
FOOD	[ spinach, fettucini ]	 The spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My entree, the Campenelli il Diavolillo, was pretty awful
FOOD	[ meat, seafood, shrimp, chicken, sausage ]	 The combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and Italian sausage
FOOD	[ sausage, oregano, basil, garlic ]	 The sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It clashed notably with the rest of the dish
FOOD	[ shrimp, chicken ]	 The shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy
FOOD	[ pasta ]	 The pasta was fresh and tasty
FOOD	[ garlic, broth ]	 It was really a shame that the "spicy garlic broth" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All portions were huge
FOOD	[ O  ]	The desserts are delicious
FOOD	[ tiramisu ]	 The tiramisu, which I sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Since we arrived at 5 p
FOOD	[ O  ]	, this came as quite a shock
FOOD	[ tiramisu ]	 It seems unlikely that they started the evening's service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning
FOOD	[ bread pudding, butter ]	 The bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't say I'll be back anytime soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have to disagree with Zenide R
FOOD	[ O  ]	's assertion that it's "easily the best Italian food in the Madison area
FOOD	[ Pasta ]	"  For the price, both Lombardino's and Tutto Pasta make better Italian food, and I shall stick to those restaurants in the future
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went here for a friend's graduation dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	The seating area was filled
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had reservations and they were right on time
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service and level of professionalism was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu is vegan friendly with a few delicious options
FOOD	[ eggplant, eggplant ]	I tried a friend's baked eggplant dish and it was by far the best eggplant course I've ever had
FOOD	[ lasagna ]	Many people in my party ordered the lasagna and loved it
FOOD	[ pesto ]	I ordered the pesto and was disappointed
FOOD	[ noodles, pesto, basil ]	The homemade noodles were good but the pesto didn't have the pop of basil I was hoping for
FOOD	[ pesto ]	Despite the pesto sauce, the experience as a whole was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would definitely recommend this establishment
FOOD	[ Vin Santo, conference, lights ]	I went to Vin Santo with some work colleagues while in Middleton for a conference, and it was terrific!  The restaurant is small, with dimmed lights, which makes for a cozy setting
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The hostess and waitress were very welcoming
FOOD	[ scampi, shrimp, garlic, artichokes, olive oil, cherry, tomatoes, spinach, fettuccine ]	We arrived around 7:45 on a Tuesday, and we were the only people in the restaurant, which seemed unusual, but maybe it was because it was a weekday?  Anyway, I ordered the scampi carciofi, which consisted of shrimp, garlic, artichokes, olive oil, and cherry tomatoes served over spinach fettuccine
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The portion was HUGE, and the food was fresh and very tasty
FOOD	[ eggplant, chicken ]	 My colleagues had the eggplant parmigiana, which looked and smelled delicious, and a chicken dish that I can't remember the name of, but which also looked pretty good
FOOD	[ Vin Santo, date ]	I'm not sure Vin Santo is the best place for a business dinner, but for a romantic date, it's perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I will make sure to come back here whenever I am in the Madison area, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a hearty, delicious Italian meal
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	We fell into Vin Santo on a busy Friday night before a recent marathon that the PIC was running in
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Despite the wait (45 minutes) the owner (a sweet and thoughtful English woman) made every effort to accommodate us and move us up the list, even asking other patrons if they minded waiting just a couple more minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	As for the food, none of us could complain about being short-changed
FOOD	[ O  ]	especially the PIC who was carb-loading
FOOD	[ pasta, sausage, noodles ]	 The plates were absolutely delicious and huge (I thoroughly enjoyed the Salsiccia Rossa--pasta with so much homemade Italian sausage that I had to take it home without noodles!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We all walked away thinking we couldn't have picked a better spot nor gotten a better deal
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decor was very nice and clean and the staff as mentioned previously was very helpful
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We'll definitely be back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great food, large portions and attentive staff
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	We love Vin Santo and have gone there about every month or two for 3 years
FOOD	[ O  ]	Small place, warm and inviting, and the lovely host/owner Clarissa greets us like family when we walk in
FOOD	[ chef, sauces, dishes ]	Her husband/chef makes fabulous and imaginative sauces to accompany the comforting Italian dishes
FOOD	[ sausage ]	Their italian sausage is probably the best we've had anywhere (including fancy places in LA, NYC, Philly, etc)
FOOD	[ lasagna, fish, ravioli, dishes ]	There are special lasagna, fish, and ravioli dishes every night
FOOD	[ lasagna ]	The lasagna is cooked to order so it takes a while, but is so worth it
FOOD	[ sausage, lasagna, sausage, cheese, bomb ]	If you are lucky enough to go on an Italian sausage lasagna night, the portion is enormous, and every bite (yes, every bite) includes sausage and cheese - it's the bomb
FOOD	[ veal, ravioli, butter, ravioli ]	I had a veal ravioli in a butter sage sauce recently that was fabulous, and unlike some pricey new Italian places where the portion is 5 or so ravioli, this dish had 10 or 12 large ones
FOOD	[ O  ]	In fact, all the portions are large, and really reasonably priced
FOOD	[ wine ]	Their wine selection is pretty sparse, and we haven't had good look finding one we like
FOOD	[ O  ]	But that is the only down side to what is always a fantastic and totally filling meal
FOOD	[ dessert, tiramisu ]	We are usually too full for dessert, but they do make their own tiramisu, which is light, fluffy, creamy, and enormous
FOOD	[ O  ]	Get one if you have someone to share it with
FOOD	[ caramel, cheesecake ]	Recently they have added a couple of desserts, including a caramel cheesecake, which I hope I am not too full to try someday
FOOD	[ Vin Santo, new year ]	Our family of four dined at Vin Santo the Monday after the new year
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We expected it to be quiet but it was a happy busy place
FOOD	[ chef ]	 The lone chef in the kitchen kept food coming at a steady pace, quicker then anticipated
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The two wait staff was attentive, friendly and very professional
FOOD	[ pizza, appetizer, tomato, pesto ]	We had a white pizza appetizer, loved the dried tomato pesto
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We each ordered an entree which were all very good
FOOD	[ sauces ]	 The  fine sauces, ingredients and preparation was far superior/delicious compared to the usual Italian restaurant!!  Portions were very large so three of us enjoyed them again the next day
FOOD	[ bread pudding ]	 We enjoyed tastes of two desserts, tirimisu and bread pudding
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Again treats for the next day
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great food, great service and a casual friendly atmosphere, a restaurant  to return to again and again!!Great Italian eatery
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere is homey and intimate
FOOD	[ spaghetti, olives, capers, anchovies, tomato sauce ]	I had the spaghetti with pine nuts, olives, capers, and anchovies in homemade tomato sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	This dish was alright
FOOD	[ olives, capers ]	I liked the idea of adding pine nuts, but the olives AND capers made it too salty for my tastes
FOOD	[ leftovers ]	I had some leftovers and they were definitely better the next day even if they were still a little salty
FOOD	[ cake ]	DEFINITELY get the Tirimasu cake while there
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was wonderful
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not too rich, but soaked in expresso and very flavorful
FOOD	[ mascarpone, cheese, cream, cake ]	There is a mascarpone cheese based whip cream which is light and not too sweet that makes the cake amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Balling in Middleton
FOOD	[ O  ]	Definitely a good place if you don't mind driving from Madtown
FOOD	[ O  ]	My boyfriend surprised me for Valentines day here, impressive I know :)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was like we were back in Italy
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 It's a tiny little place with very authentic italian dishes
FOOD	[ lasagna ]	 They make the lasagna fresh in individual servings when you order it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was amazing
FOOD	[ seafood, pasta ]	 I had the seafood pasta (my standard order) which was HUGE
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I mean you should definitely split this
FOOD	[ tiramisu ]	 We ended the night with the tiramisu 
FOOD	[ tiramisu, tiramisu ]	and let me tell you, I am a tiramisu connoisseur (i pretty much order it every time it's on the menu) and this was the BEST tiramisu I have ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It even beats the stuff I had in Italy
FOOD	[ date ]	All in all this a perfect romantic, date place and I would definitely return
FOOD	[ O  ]	"Ummm Good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yummy

FOOD	[ O  ]	What is this delicious piece? Do you wanna try this? It's good

FOOD	[ forks ]	No footsies or romantic hand holding but just shuffling forks with an extreme eager to try each other's plate
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	Vin Santo is THAT good
FOOD	[ seafood, Ravioli ]	I got seafood Ravioli with pine nuts, which completely blew me away
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is by far the best Italian food I've ever had

FOOD	[ O  ]	Party of 4 celebrating a birthday
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seated immediately
FOOD	[ O  ]	Intimate seating, some chairs a little close
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food was delivered piping hot and service was good
FOOD	[ lasagne, salmon ]	Food we had was the lasagne(huge portions) and salmon and one spaghettti, all outstanding
FOOD	[ O  ]	No salads, but they looked good
FOOD	[ chef, sous, chef ]	The only annoyance was the chef/owner? Numerous times during our dinner he was grumbling/shouting loud enough for us to hear from our table, kinda shouting at his sous chef or someone in the kitchen and on several occasions came out and sat and kinda watched people eating
FOOD	[ O  ]	(weird)and grumbled to the hostess about not doing her job
FOOD	[ appearance ]	In appearance, she seemed to be very efficient at her job and had stopped at our table and asked how our food was, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	Upon leaving, he was in the front of the house grumbling again
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not a good thing to do! I would go again, based on the food, but hope this man
FOOD	[ O  ]	leaves his sour attitude out of the customers face
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tiramusu amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fed all four of us with no problem
FOOD	[ O  ]	Was up in Madtown from Chicago to run the Crazylegs and used that as a nice excuse to carbo load
FOOD	[ O  ]	Was absolutely blown away by the food here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There is plenty of great Italian in Chicago and this was equal to better than anything I've had in Little Italy
FOOD	[ Pecorino ]	We split a couple caesar salads, Salsiccia Rossa, Pollo Tuscana, and Linquini Pecorino
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Everything was incredible fresh and tasty
FOOD	[ Pasta, al dente, dishes ]	 Pasta was cooked to a PERFECT al dente on all dishes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nothing was oversauced
FOOD	[ sausage ]	 The homemade Italian sausage was awesome (wish it was spicier)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Honestly some of the best homemade Italian I've ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ambiance is great, feels like you're in someone's home
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The tables and chairs look like a collection from a garage sale
FOOD	[ O  ]	mean that in a good way
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There'a a really tiny bar upfront that seats 4 people
FOOD	[ tiramisu ]	Do NOT miss the tiramisu-- simple sensational
FOOD	[ Canoli ]	 Canoli was good but was my least favorite part of the meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Shell was a little too overcooked for me and found the filling to be good but a little gritty
FOOD	[ O  ]	All in all easy 4, if not 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Will be back next time up in the area
FOOD	[ O  ]	,Adam was my server and did a great job of suggesting things as well as being a helpful opinion when I was choosing between one dish or another
FOOD	[ Calamari ]	-Calamari was heavenly and really hearty and heavy
FOOD	[ calamari, Olive ]	this is not the kind of calamari that you get at Olive Garden or most Italian restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	this was heavenly
FOOD	[ O  ]	perfect bit of spiciness and the portion was enormous
FOOD	[ Scampi ]	-Scampi Gabriela
FOOD	[ O  ]	was amazing
FOOD	[ pasta, al dente ]	the pasta was perfectly al dente
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	and the shrimp were huge
FOOD	[ O  ]	a legitimate dinner portion that you had to take home
FOOD	[ Bread Pudding, dessert ]	-Bread Pudding for dessert
FOOD	[ O  ]	not at all the type that you get at other restaurants again
FOOD	[ bread pudding ]	this was mushy and didn't resemble the bread pudding I'm use to
FOOD	[ bread pudding ]	but it was actually the best bread pudding I've ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	it was simply mouthwatering
FOOD	[ glass, pinot noir ]	-I had a glass of pinot noir with my dinner and it was a great accompaniment to my meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of the owners
FOOD	[ O  ]	Clarissa came by and personally asked how I liked the food and the service
FOOD	[ chat ]	we had a long chat
FOOD	[ O  ]	told her what I loved and a few pointers
FOOD	[ O  ]	she has the same name as my mom so I instantly felt a connection with her
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a MUST when in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will definitely be back!I would love to rate their food, but never got the opportunity
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Happened to stop there on a Saturday evening at about 5:45p and could not even get in the door because the hostess was blocking the area with a party of four
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Instead of taking the party aside so we could enter, and I should point out I was on crutches, she had us wait outside until she could seat them
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We entered AND STEPPED ASIDE so others could enter
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There were three in a our party
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When she asked if we had reservations, I replied no,  and she commented NO?  You KNOW IT IS SATURDAY
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I wanted to say yes, yesterday was Friday and tomorrow is Sunday
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Instead I replied that I was TERRIBLY sorry i did not realize i needed a reservation, and she once again reminded me it was SATURDAY
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I had never been there and did not realize that it was a quaint, small place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Had I known, I would certainly made a reservation
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I probably will not make a reservation and try the menu since the hostess obviously thought I did not know what day it was
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Yes, it is probably my loss, but I don't enjoy being insulted
FOOD	[ Vin Santo, Olive, Vin Santo, dessert, bread pudding, tiramisu ]	I can't think of anything bad to say about Vin Santo! The prices are the same as Olive Garden but the food is 10x the quality and 5x as authentic!  I have eaten at Vin Santo five times now and I am never disappointed, everything I have had is delicious, and the dessert (bread pudding, tiramisu) is to die for
FOOD	[ cuisine ]	 The owner is very sweet and accommodating and she is there everytime I go, it's a local family owned business with world class cuisine!Really a wonderful Italian Food experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything was delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service was attentive, but not overly stuffy
FOOD	[ Bread pudding ]	Bread pudding is unattractive, but super delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Price is high, but worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything was baked fresh, so expect a little bit of a longer wait, but well worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very generous portions -- best plan would probably be to get salads and split an entree or plan to bring some home with you
FOOD	[ sausage, lasagna ]	I had the italian sausage lasagna, which was very very good
FOOD	[ vin santo ]	I would rate vin santo at 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars for food and 4 stars for service
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	I guess I'm used to great Italian fare in San francisco, but the food at Vin Santo didnt quite cut it for me both times I've eaten here
FOOD	[ O  ]	The portions are large, but taste doesnt cut it for me
FOOD	[ O  ]	Outstanding! This was our first time here and it was great
FOOD	[ wine ]	The server was very nice and responsive (he could have known a little more about the wine selection, but that wasn't a big deal)
FOOD	[ sauces, flavor ]	The food was great, light sauces and tons of flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	We will definitely be back!This is my new favorite restaurant in the Madison area
FOOD	[ sauces ]	 Everything that crossed our table from the fresh pastas to the delicious sauces was a treat
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The portions were generous and the prices reasonable
FOOD	[ calamari, appetizer, tomato, fennel ]	 The calamari in the appetizer was tender and delicious in a rich and spicy tomato/fennel sauce
FOOD	[ puttanesca, olives, garlic ]	 The puttanesca sauce was dense with olives and the whole cloves of roasted garlic were a real treat
FOOD	[ bread pudding ]	 The bread pudding was very good, but for me was a little heavy on the cinnamon
FOOD	[ Tiramisu ]	 I think I'll go with the Tiramisu next time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our water was pleasant and attentive
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The atmosphere was casual and cozy/romantic
FOOD	[ tea, lights ]	 but I would rather see real candles on the tables vs the battery operated tea lights
FOOD	[ BREAD PUDDING ]	GET THE BREAD PUDDING!!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a nice restaurant that is cramped and casually decorated
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is the stand out
FOOD	[ O  ]	The front is run by one of the owners and her service is very brief as she seats you and quickly moves on to the next task
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitresses do a great job with the specials and describing the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is delivered in an acceptable amount of time
FOOD	[ chef ]	You can see the chef and the kitchen through the window between the kitchen and the dining room which is always fun
FOOD	[ heat ]	Their red sauce has a bit of spicy heat to it
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife and I really do like this place for its great food and for its character
FOOD	[ O  ]	Average food, good service, poor ambience
FOOD	[ bucks ]	If you want something a lot better and don't mind the extra bucks, go around the corner to Louisianne's
FOOD	[ fish, dishes, cream, sauces ]	Fresh Italian food with a emphasis on fish dishes and cream sauces
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had an unbelievable experience yesterday
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	I went to Vin Santo hoping to order some food to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	Upon brief greeting the owner informed us that they "don't do takeout on the weekend"
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is astonishing and something that has never happened to me before
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I am a foodie an have dined on 5 different continents, including Michelin rated restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	Shocked, we went to Villa Dolce where the owner was very accommodating to our take out request
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was delicious and very reasonably priced
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	Your loss Vin Santo
FOOD	[ O  ]	We are never coming back
FOOD	[ bowl, pasta, seafood ]	All I ever want is to go to a restaurant and get a giant bowl of fresh pasta that is stuffed with seafood, and that's what I got! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are super duper friendly here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is a nice restaurant, but not stuffy at all
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Leave the tuxes at home boys
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere is more casual and quaint
FOOD	[ dishes ]	The dishes are more rustic Italian, rather than fancy schmansy Italian
FOOD	[ bread pudding ]	The bread pudding comes a little messy, but so good, the table will definitely fight for it
FOOD	[ O  ]	There isn't much seating, so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can even do it online, so that's cool
FOOD	[ aroma ]	Plus, the aroma is completely mouth watering
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Can't wait to go back there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Need
FOOD	[ O  ]	More
FOOD	[ Pasta ]	Pasta
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great food, portions could be smaller
FOOD	[ O  ]	A little pricey for Middleton
FOOD	[ O  ]	Would try somewhere else next time but would also not hesitate to return
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of Middleton's hidden gems
FOOD	[ lasagna ]	 It's our favorite place to go for special occasions! Be sure to try the "lasagna of the day"
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's always worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	it was okay
FOOD	[ O  ]	small place but the food was good
FOOD	[ O  ]	large portions
FOOD	[ O  ]	Does not live up to a recent review in Madison paper
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cons: Too pricey & ala carte
FOOD	[ pasta, dishes ]	 The pasta dishes in range $15- $20
FOOD	[ O  ]	The entrees: $20 - 30
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decor needs fresh paint and new carpet  and the restroom slightly grotty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Server forgot to put in some of our order
FOOD	[ ravioli, vin santo, flavor ]	 My ravioli vin santo was lacking flavor
FOOD	[ parmesan, cheese, bread ]	 Need to serve parmesan cheese with the bread & oil
FOOD	[ O  ]	Plus: Nice people
FOOD	[ mushroom, soup ]	 Good Tuscan mushroom soup
FOOD	[ O  ]	For the tiny storefront, family restaurant it is priced too high which sets your expectations higher and does not live up to those expectations
FOOD	[ salad ]	 It would be fine for your corner Italian joint for everyday meals if they offered a salad with the meal and cut their $$
FOOD	[ O  ]	Unbelievably disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm in town for business, and went on a week night
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They were not terribly busy, but as a solo diner, I was treated quite poorly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Mostly ignored during my meal, I had to get up to chase someone down just for a water refill
FOOD	[ glass, wine ]	 Not once did anyone check on my meal (I would have loved a second glass of wine), which wasn't stellar anyway
FOOD	[ O  ]	I did stop and tell the woman at the front that not every diner has the luxury of being able to eat with family or friends, and that I felt my service was horrible
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Maybe it'll spare the next person eating alone and hoping for good service
FOOD	[ O  ]	I travel to Madison Wi frequently for work, and I can tell you that they'll not get repeat business from me
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	Vin Santo is a good, but small Italian restaurant in Middleton
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's a larger selection of pastas at this place than most other Italian restaurants in the area
FOOD	[ O  ]	But other than that, it seems like the standard Italian
FOOD	[ lasagna ]	The lasagna is okay, but small
FOOD	[ pasta, dishes ]	But most of the pasta dishes are legit and are served with good portions
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service is kind of slow and I'd recommend getting a reservation on weekends
FOOD	[ dessert ]	Nonetheless, dessert is great
FOOD	[ Italian bread, pudding, tiramisu ]	Though expensive, their Italian bread pudding and tiramisu are huge and tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	I absolutely loved this little restaurant! Its tucked away and has a very intimate atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Italian food tastes homemade and authentic
FOOD	[ date ]	This is a great place for a date but not for a family
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is very good, but overpriced
FOOD	[ dessert, bread pudding, bread pudding ]	My wife's favorite dessert is bread pudding and I was told this place has the best bread pudding around, and it did not disappoint, it was excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was also very good
FOOD	[ mushroom, onion, ravioli ]	My wife ordered mushroom and onion ravioli and her dish was better than mine
FOOD	[ pasta, shrimp, sausage, chicken ]	I ordered a pasta dish with sauteed shrimp, spicy italian sausage and chicken
FOOD	[ chicken ]	It was also excellent, but I thought it could've done without the chicken
FOOD	[ caesar salad ]	I started with a caesar salad and it tasted really fishy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, the portions are huge, if you're going with one other person, you could probably split everything
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was excellent, but the decor wasn't very appealing, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's a very small space
FOOD	[ bread ]	I'd check it out, especially to try the bread putting, but it's not a must
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Like others said not really that impressive on the inside, the tables are really jammed in there
FOOD	[ butt ]	 I guess that ok if you don't mind you waitresses butt in your face and food when she is at the table next to you
FOOD	[ pasta, scallops, shrimp, mussels, calamari, tomato sauce ]	 I ordered pasta with scallops, shrimp, mussels, and calamari with a slightly spicy tomato sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was ok
FOOD	[ pasta ]	 The pasta was cooked perfect
FOOD	[ salt ]	 And again like others said, it really lacked salt
FOOD	[ seafood, mussels, shrimp, scallops, squid, ravioli, onion, mushrooms ]	 The seafood was good lots of mussels could have used more shrimp and scallops and a lot less squid!  My wife had the special of giant homemade ravioli with a caramelized onion and portabello mushrooms in a balsamic sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This was really tasty
FOOD	[ bread pudding, coffee, salt ]	 The bread pudding is amazing!  Not pretty to look at but delicious!  The coffee is great too!  Would give more stars if they used a little more salt and a few less tables
FOOD	[ meat ]	 I would have also liked to see a few more meat choices
FOOD	[ seafood, chicken ]	 The menu is really mostly seafood and chicken
FOOD	[ sausage, meat ]	 A few sausage offerings but no other choices of meat
FOOD	[ steak ]	 A nice steak would do wonders
FOOD	[ O  ]	With all of the Italian restaurants in Madison It's hard for me to give this place more than 3 stars
FOOD	[ Mussels, butter sauce ]	We started out with Mussels that were served in a butter sauce
FOOD	[ mussels ]	The mussels tasted a little bit fishy for my liking
FOOD	[ veal, tortellini ]	For my main course I had veal tortellini
FOOD	[ shrimp, pasta, cream sauce ]	The better half had a shrimp pasta in a white cream sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	Her dish was far btter than mine
FOOD	[ bread pudding, tiramisu ]	For desert we had bread pudding and tiramisu
FOOD	[ O  ]	Both were excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My Biggest gripes about this place were the kitchen is super small, so it can take quite a while to get your food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, they have very few options for kids
FOOD	[ O  ]	BEWARE: SERVING SIZES ARE GINORMOUS!
FOOD	[ pasta ]	We did not know this^^ and over-ordered!! Next time the BF and I are splitting a plate of pasta! 
FOOD	[ Calamari, appetizer, dishes ]	Calamari appetizer was SO inexpensive and SO much food! In fact I think all their dishes are underpriced for the quantity that you get
FOOD	[ O  ]	This was the most delicious app I have had--so flavorful and so FRESH! 
FOOD	[ calamari, sausage, pasta, seafood, pasta ]	On top of the calamari we also got the sausage pasta and the seafood pasta
FOOD	[ O  ]	Both had heaping amounts of food and delicious in their own sense
FOOD	[ seafood, appetizer, sausage, pasta ]	We were seafood-ed out after the appetizer so we were devouring the sausage pasta
FOOD	[ sausage, pasta, noodles, seafood ]	The sauce for the sausage pasta was amazing--we took the noodles from the seafood dish and dunked it in the other plate's sauce to drink it all up :)Not exactly a hot spot for me, dinner was good, but I've had better
FOOD	[ O  ]	Unbelievably good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Portions are huge and everything is freshly prepared and flavorful
FOOD	[ ravioli ]	The ravioli is excellent! Authentic and homemade
FOOD	[ hospitality ]	Friendly servers and it can get pretty crowded so make a reservation on the weekend!On rare occasions I am transported back to Italy--either by the ambiance, the hospitality, or the flavors of a restaurant
FOOD	[ hospitality, Vin Santo ]	Tonight I have had that experience as a result of the hospitality and flavors of Vin Santo
FOOD	[ ravioli, pasta ]	I had the ravioli pasta special and it was wonderful
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decor is somewhat meh, but the food was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	The servers make the cocktails, which seemed odd
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will come back with each visit to Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife and I ended up here because it had outdoor seating and was happy to accommodate our dogs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It had excellent service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food was fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The plates we had were simple fare with exceptional ingredients
FOOD	[ chef ]	 The chef did a wonderful job mixing and balancing flavors
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Even the bar tender nailed the Bellini's
FOOD	[ appetizer ]	It is very reasonable priced by which I mean a good, long dinner (2 hours+) for two with appetizer and drinks will probably come to about $100
FOOD	[ glass, wine ]	 It is worth it!  If just having dinner and a glass of wine expect somewhere closer to $50-$60
FOOD	[ Vin Santo ]	 This is a great place to dine!After looking around Madison for a good and authentic Italian place, Vin Santo has the potential
FOOD	[ pasta, tiramisu ]	 The pasta is definitely fresh, and the tiramisu was very good
FOOD	[ dishes, flavor ]	 Downsides - I felt that the dishes could have used more finesse in the seasoning and flavor and less in the overall amount, they were tasty but did not just pop out at me
FOOD	[ ravioli, pasta, spinach ]	 For instance, the ravioli was great - good pasta and sauce, but the spinach stuffing was just bland
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 Nevertheless, I will go back - need to find out if some of those spicier dishes are truly spicy
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is one of my favorite restaurants in Middleton
FOOD	[ O  ]	The hostess and servers are friendly, and the food is delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Entrees are large and flavorful
FOOD	[ O  ]	Salads are also large and fresh
FOOD	[ Salad ]	Salad is not included with an entree, but if you decide to add one to your order, I suggest splitting it
FOOD	[ salad ]	The salad is large enough to be a meal for some folks
FOOD	[ scampi ]	For an entree, I highly recommend the scampi diavalio
FOOD	[ pasta, sausage, chicken, shrimp, onions, olive oil ]	It's a heavenly dish with campanelle pasta, sausage, chicken, shrimp, bell peppers, onions, and olive oil
FOOD	[ red pepper, flakes, spice ]	There are also some red pepper flakes to add a spicy kick, but the spice is definitely not overpowering to my taste
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, this is a wonderful local restaurant with a cozy, friendly atmosphere and great food
FOOD	[ O  ]	I highly recommend it
FOOD	[ Soup ]	I've walked past the Soup Factory numerous times on my way into Barriques
FOOD	[ O  ]	I decided to finally stop in yesterday
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now, as you can guess, this place's focus is
FOOD	[ SOUP ]	SOUP
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	They do have a wide selection of salads and sandwiches(both hot and cold)
FOOD	[ chicken, mushroom, sandwich ]	I decided to try the chicken and mushroom stew, and half of a caprese sandwich
FOOD	[ sandwich, soup ]	I really like it when I have the half sandwich option, so I don't feel stuffed to the brim adding a soup
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	The stew was really good, almost as good as my fave at Java Cat! The sandwich was decent, but nothing amazing
FOOD	[ pesto, bread, tomato, mozzarella, griddle ]	It's pretty easy to smear pesto on a slice of bread with tomato and mozzarella and squeeze it on a griddle!
FOOD	[ soup, soup ]	I'll definitely be stopping back in to try another soup this fall/winter!The soup wasn't bad, but the guy who was serving it was really creepy and totally ruined the entire experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	Plus, they were out of my first and second choices even though they were supposed to be open for 2 more hours
FOOD	[ Soup ]	I didn't know what to expect from The Soup Factory, but I liked what I found! I visited around noon on a weekday and the place was hopping with what seemed to be a local business crowd
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	I ordered the Cheesy Caprese sandwich and loved it
FOOD	[ O  ]	I sampled some of the soups as well and all were good, but maybe not great
FOOD	[ soup ]	There are about 8 different varieties of soup to choose from each day, everything from different chilis to stews to bisques--you won't get bored
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	And a regular menu of salads and sandwiches is available
FOOD	[ O  ]	Friendly, hard-working staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've gone here a few times to see bands
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's alright
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bar is fairly large, and they have volleyball outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never been impressed with the barstaff
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not exactly running up to greet you and get your order, and the mixed drinks are always a bit off
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never had any of the food, but I've heard it's decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will go here again if there's a band I want to see(because it's only a few blocks from home), but you'll never hear me say "Whadya say we go to the Tavern for a night of fun?!?!"The Club Tavern is an interesting bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	It has a wide range of crowd members from the youthful to the middle aged
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've been to this bar on numerous occasions for volleyball, and hanging out
FOOD	[ O  ]	and for most times its been a pleasant experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	The drinks are fairly priced, there is a lot of space so you don't feel crowded and usually the music is fair
FOOD	[ O  ]	Some points of concern though arrive with smoking
FOOD	[ O  ]	When will they make it a state wide band to smoke in bars and restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The bartenders also seem a little snobby on occasion
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wouldn't say this is the bar to go if your looking to have a great night but if you want a fun/interesting night with some interesting characters make sure you visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	The wait staff were non-existent, the food was atrocious, the mixed drinks weren't drinkable, and the atmosphere was filthy
FOOD	[ O  ]	What more can I say? Ick
FOOD	[ O  ]	A quiet bar out in Middleton, it's certainly not the worst, but it ain't the greatest either
FOOD	[ O  ]	Having now played 2 sessions of their "intermediate" volleyball leagues, I'm wishing the second one ended sooner
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They need to drag folks in, so they make you play, come hell or high water
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've heard rumors of sand volleyball
FOOD	[ O  ]	in the snow
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Maybe I'm just bitter
FOOD	[ O  ]	cold
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is nothing worth writing home about
FOOD	[ sandwiches, nachos ]	 The sandwiches are pretty standard fare and nachos are decent
FOOD	[ fries ]	 I'm a sucker for seasoned fries and they're pretty decent here, so I'll add another star
FOOD	[ beer ]	 Unfortunately, the beer isn't cheap, nor were there other obvious specials
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Look around and find somewhere else if you're out for an evening of drinking
FOOD	[ O  ]	The TVs aren't all that great for a sports bar, which the Club Tavern tries to achieve, as far as I can tell
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There is a projector and large screen, but I haven't seen it used
FOOD	[ O  ]	They've got a couple of pool tables and dartboards as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bartenders aren't terrible, it just takes some time for them to warm up to you
FOOD	[ O  ]	 After my 4th or 5th trip there (again, because of the volleyball league), they were friendly and joking around with the crew
FOOD	[ O  ]	I want to like this place - I really, really do
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But it's fairly rundown, the bar staff makes you feel as if you're ruining their day by asking for a drink, the food is average, and the bathroom conjures memories of b-list horror movie finales
FOOD	[ game ]	I've spent a few afternoons here watching the game, and even while sitting at the bar and tipping well with every drink, service is lackluster at best
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've had their breakfast and some of the lunch fare - meh, nothing spectacular by any means
FOOD	[ bottle ]	Very much "the working man's bar," and I appreciate that aspect, but I can't help but feel like I'm just a step away from getting jabbed with a broken bottle or otherwise needing a tetanus shot whenever I stop by The Club Tavern
FOOD	[ O  ]	Middleton has better bars - try The Midtown Pub or Paul's Neighborhood Bar for a more personable and less sketchy experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	745 on a Friday night with two of my buddies
FOOD	[ fish, shrimp ]	  We all got the fish fry plus some deep fried shrimp
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Service was attentive, but everything seemed to go wrong
FOOD	[ sirloin, beer ]	 Out of sirloin and a certain beer
FOOD	[ soup ]	  Forgot to give us the soup until after the entree arrived
FOOD	[ Fish ]	 Fish was average for the price, I couldn't imagine it was made to order
FOOD	[ Cole, lettuce, mayonnaise ]	 Cole saw sucked,  it was soggy lettuce smothered in warm mayonnaise
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fantastic for St Patrick's Day - I've been looking for a worthy destination since Irish Waters closed five or so years ago, and have finally found it! Great meal, great value, fantastic, speedy service and perfect atmosphere
FOOD	[ corned beef ]	Only thing lacking is the quality if the corned beef - if it were a little better of a cut, I'd have given it five stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum
FOOD	[ O  ]	Horrendously managed
FOOD	[ O  ]	Terrible service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very rude and the managers seem to treat their employees with no respect
FOOD	[ O  ]	The drinks a watery and the tap selection is average
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is ok but not worth a trip over to this joint
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't recommend
FOOD	[ vodka ]	I dont know why people are ripping Club Tavern a new one, I love this place!! The drinks are cheap; I've purchased vodka tonics for $3 and top shelf for $4!  Its never too packed and the bartenders are always beyond friendly
FOOD	[ bloody mary ]	 They probably also have the best bloody mary's  and chaser Ive had for those hair of the dog mornings
FOOD	[ beat, Brewer ]	 And plus they have a slot machine there that pays out in cash, you cant really beat that!Do not get involved in their Brewer giveaway nights! No bartender is aware of promotion or rules which are clearly printed on posters
FOOD	[ Brewer ]	!  Wearing Brewer gear a requirement to win tickets and jersey
FOOD	[ O  ]	Three people in the place with gear on,not one of those won!? Hmmmm
FOOD	[ game ]	When asked,reply was Ben won[10 seconds after game concluded
FOOD	[ O  ]	Of course"Ben" could not be found! 
FOOD	[ fish ]	A fraud! Doubt anything awarded!A friend proposed Club Tavern for fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 None of us had ever been there
FOOD	[ O  ]	While the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first "real" meal you've had in ages
FOOD	[ O  ]	 To some, it may make you want to go back to the island
FOOD	[ O  ]	atleast food is fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	We arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area
FOOD	[ diet ]	I ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting
FOOD	[ diet ]	 Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead
FOOD	[ diet ]	 Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat
FOOD	[ glass ]	but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere
FOOD	[ glass, diet ]	 Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It seemed a little less flat, but not by much
FOOD	[ glass ]	 Atleast that glass was clean
FOOD	[ bloody mary, bacon, vodka ]	Friend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka
FOOD	[ bacon, bacon, flavor ]	 He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Didnt try it myself
FOOD	[ appetizer, bacon, onion, cheese ]	After the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember
FOOD	[ O  ]	20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order
FOOD	[ fish, appetizer ]	 I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He said "oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand
FOOD	[ O  ]	you had moo-skis
FOOD	[ O  ]	theyll be here soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis
FOOD	[ O  ]	They were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very plain and greasy tasting
FOOD	[ bacon, onion ]	 Realized there should be bacon and onion
FOOD	[ O  ]	which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later
FOOD	[ O  ]	 For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar
FOOD	[ fish, pollock, beer, fries, coleslaw ]	Finally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:
FOOD	[ Fish ]	Fish: ok sized
FOOD	[ O  ]	breading was hard(which i like), taste ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not worst Ive had, but no where near good
FOOD	[ Fries ]	Fries: Were best part of the meal
FOOD	[ paprika, color ]	Tartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color
FOOD	[ dill ]	 didnt taste any dill
FOOD	[ Coleslaw, slaw ]	Coleslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw
FOOD	[ mayo, forks, cabbage ]	 It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy
FOOD	[ SOUP ]	it was literally SOUP
FOOD	[ fish ]	Ordered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar
FOOD	[ fish ]	We were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish
FOOD	[ O  ]	He came back with our checks after 10 mins
FOOD	[ fish ]	 We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night
FOOD	[ O  ]	 2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finishing up our bills
FOOD	[ fish ]	and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up
FOOD	[ O  ]	Maybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night
FOOD	[ O  ]	Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it
FOOD	[ O  ]	The best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music
FOOD	[ O  ]	We  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them
FOOD	[ O  ]	30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes
FOOD	[ iron ]	 I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much
FOOD	[ salad ]	girlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask
FOOD	[ olives ]	 Also noted her old fashioned came w cherries and olives in it, which is taboo? Supposed to be one or other?  Im a crazy WI who doesnt order many OF's, so not sure about this
FOOD	[ Taco ]	I used to love stopping by this place on Taco Mondays
FOOD	[ cow, beat ]	I think you used to get 5 for a dollar at one point and you could get a pitcher of spotted cow for like $9 so you just couldnt beat it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Slowly they started upping the prices etc
FOOD	[ fish ]	I think they must have gotten a new fish because for the last couple years its had a metallic taste
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's one of those things where they seem to have chose quantity over quality
FOOD	[ brunch ]	Went to The Club this morning for Sunday brunch (which we normally do)
FOOD	[ eggs, bacon, muffin, French toast ]	Usually have eggs/bacon/muffin or toast but today splurged on French toast
FOOD	[ French toast ]	Was VERY good - Love my French toast crispy and this totally hit the spot
FOOD	[ bacon ]	We always ask for our bacon crispy, and today's was no exception
FOOD	[ O  ]	We also stopped in Wednesday for Bingo/Trivia night
FOOD	[ Moose ]	I thought I was good on trivia, but Moose came up with stumpers I couldn't even find on my phone on Google - but others got them
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had burgers that night and they were great
FOOD	[ O  ]	Exactly what we ordered
FOOD	[ onion rings ]	Even the onion rings were hot and quite tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wait staff is a hoot - they enjoy shaking things up with different songs that all present can enjoy - who doesn't like Muppets doing Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody"?? They're all very accommodating with tv channel change requests, please turn up/down the music, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	BEST NIGHT TO GO: Badger Band Concert Day in April! The Club gets a bus for Thursday night's concert and you are fed a catered dinner prior to boarding
FOOD	[ Jambalaya ]	There's way too much food and it's all really good - don't get me started on the Jambalaya! - whole thing is a great deal
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband and I have enjoyed The Club for years 
FOOD	[ O  ]	and will continue to
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not my favorite live music venue in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They pull in good local acts weekly, and the drinks are tasty and inexpensive enough, but it's a bit too loud to enjoy the performances without blowing out an eardrum
FOOD	[ Moose ]	 Do stop-in to see Moose, though - he's cool
FOOD	[ O  ]	When I go to the Club Tavern, it's a little bit like going home
FOOD	[ O  ]	No, really, I used to live upstairs
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wouldn't call it fine dining, but the food is good
FOOD	[ Moose ]	I'm a big fan of the Moose Burger, though I change it up a little bit
FOOD	[ cheese, ham, mushrooms, bbq, ditch, mushrooms, bacon, egg ]	It comes with 3 slices of cheese, ham, mushrooms, and bbq sauce, but I have them ditch the mushrooms (i'm allergic) and add bacon and a fried egg, because i LIKE my burgers to give me heart palpitations
FOOD	[ taco, tacos, beer ]	Monday night taco nights are pretty awesome, The tacos aren't anything fancy, but they're cheap, and help to offset the copious amounts of tap beer I tend to imbibe
FOOD	[ beer ]	(note: if you drink it straight from the pitcher, it still counts as ONE beer) Club Tavern also offers a pretty good breakfast, and they have specials for the early birds
FOOD	[ bloody mary ]	Best bloody mary in town, (except mine of course, but I live 1000 miles away now
FOOD	[ Happy  hour ]	) Happy  hour at the Club was always my favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	75 cent pints of Miller High Life
FOOD	[ beer, happy hour ]	Not the world's greatest beer, but definitely affordable during happy hour
FOOD	[ O  ]	I always like to visit the Club when I get back to town
FOOD	[ fish ]	New kitchen manager is making some great food these days! AWESOME fish fry on Friday night
FOOD	[ Soup, appetizer, spring rolls, raspberry, cucumber, garlic, pepper ]	Soup is outstanding and service is friendly and fast, and fun! There's also a new appetizer on the menu that is quite tasty  - spring rolls with a raspberry sauce and a cucumber/garlic pepper sauce - just outstanding! Service is friendly, too!Quick review: Family-run breakfast/lunch joint with your typical diner staples
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods
FOOD	[ breads ]	 Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends
FOOD	[ O  ]	Detailed review:
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a "Meh
FOOD	[ O  ]	"  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read
FOOD	[ coffee ]	A waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu
FOOD	[ coffee, coffee, carafe ]	 She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe
FOOD	[ cream, coffee ]	 She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee
FOOD	[ cream, coffee ]	oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee
FOOD	[ eggs, eggs benedict, belgian waffles, turnovers, muffins ]	Breakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc)
FOOD	[ eggs ]	The waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the "Hen's Nest" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast
FOOD	[ pancake, cream, coffee ]	 I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee
FOOD	[ containers ]	 She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We were in business
FOOD	[ O  ]	Before leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them
FOOD	[ onions, tomatoes, potatoes ]	so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty
FOOD	[ pancake ]	 The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I found myself wishing I had ordered 2
FOOD	[ char, onions, flavor ]	The Hen's Nest was just "OK" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough
FOOD	[ O  ]	I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless
FOOD	[ O  ]	 :-(  
FOOD	[ O  ]	The multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	$12 for my modest breakfast - $5
FOOD	[ O  ]	99 for the Hen's Nest, $0
FOOD	[ O  ]	89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2
FOOD	[ pancake ]	99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1
FOOD	[ coffee ]	89 for coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service = 2 stars (nothing great)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value = 1
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)
FOOD	[ O  ]	MISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd really like to give C's 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star "gift" rating
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	:-)
FOOD	[ O  ]	For what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It'll probably be a while before I visit C's again
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars for food and service
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere and decor could use some help -- the interior is clean and neat, but dated
FOOD	[ O  ]	The outside/exterior can't be helping business -- if you can get past the stark white exterior walls, the green roof line, and the nondescript sign, you'll be treated to a good, "from scratch" meal that tastes homemade, with excellent/friendly service
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a great place for breakfast
FOOD	[ Mustard ]	So there I was, with a soaking wet tent and on my way to the National Mustard Museum
FOOD	[ mustard ]	But hey, hard-core mustard fan as I am, I know better 
FOOD	[ mustard ]	than to start the day with all-you-can-sample-mustard, right?
FOOD	[ O  ]	So the BF and I surfed Yelp to find a decent breakfast stop and Lo, right down the street from our campground was C's, so we figured we'd stop in
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now, it was Father's Day, which we realized when we walked in, cause the place was packed
FOOD	[ breakfast food ]	It's pretty much your standard breakfast food, with some specialty bakery fare
FOOD	[ O  ]	Clean, tasty and fairly reasonably priced
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is not a huge place either, but there was PLENTY of waitstaff to keep things moving
FOOD	[ skillet ]	I had the skillet breakfast, which I was very pleased to find had the option of turkey
FOOD	[ meat, pork ]	(This made me happy, as I like meat at breakfast after a night of rainy camping, but am allergic to pork
FOOD	[ skillet, potatoes, onions, eggs ]	) The skillet had turkey, potatoes, onions and green peppers mixed together, with toast and 2 eggs on top
FOOD	[ eggs ]	The eggs were perfect, which impressed me, given how crazy busy the place was
FOOD	[ onions, potatoes ]	I do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste
FOOD	[ onions ]	In fact, the onions were damn near raw
FOOD	[ O  ]	Luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but I take away a star for that 
FOOD	[ potatoes ]	(BF says his potatoes were underdone too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not raw, but not quite done enough
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Waitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled
FOOD	[ O  ]	And, since it was a bakery, we HAD to at least try a cinnamon roll
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was a good roll, and they even warmed it up for us
FOOD	[ Strawberry, Rhubarb ]	I noticed that they had a LOT of baked goods specializing with Strawberry and Rhubarb, which is in season right now
FOOD	[ rhubarb ]	To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tends to indicate a reliance on seasonal (and hopefully locally grown) produce
FOOD	[ Steak, Eggs, berry, waffle ]	It being Father's day, they had a special on Steak and Eggs and a fresh berry topped waffle special too
FOOD	[ chocolate, strawberry ]	Dads got a HUGE complimentary chocolate-covered strawberry, which I thought was nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ eggs ]	Oh yeah, the eggs with Hollendaise sauce looked and smelled really good
FOOD	[ O  ]	We tried C's for breakfast over the 4th of July weekend
FOOD	[ O  ]	Upon entering, it is obvious that this is a no-frills family-style restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pretty much gives that "small town" feel, which isn't bad by any means
FOOD	[ dishes ]	Our dishes were standard
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not bad, but nothing great
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was lackluster, even if it was pretty busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place does look to have an AMAZING baked goods section
FOOD	[ muffins ]	Tons of pastries, cookies, and muffins
FOOD	[ breads ]	Plus, all of the breads are made in-house(my darling dear said his toast was top notch)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Next time we stop in, I'll be skipping the menu, and snatching something out of the bakery case
FOOD	[ O  ]	C's is a FANTASTIC place for breakfast
FOOD	[ breads ]	Family owned, this restaurant makes all the breads, buns, pies, and bakery in house
FOOD	[ eggs benedict, choice, ham, ham ]	I had the eggs benedict and was pleased to be given a choice of ham or turkey, but of course I had to try the more traditional ham
FOOD	[ cheddar cheese, onions ]	I also made my hashbrowns "C's hashbrowns" by adding cheddar cheese and onions
FOOD	[ eggs benedict, hollandaise sauce ]	The eggs benedict was delicious, the hollandaise sauce was also homemade and was the best I have ever had and the freshly thick shredded hashbrowns were very tasty and not greasy! C's was busy on this Sunday morning, but the service was quick, friendly, and delightful
FOOD	[ O  ]	C's has quickly become a favorite for Sunday breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would love to give this place 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	5, it is very friendly and inviting
FOOD	[ bread, sourdough, rye ]	They serve fresh baked toasted bread with the breakfast items, try the sourdough or rye
FOOD	[ O  ]	They give you a nice sized portion and they quick, not rushed
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place is always busy which is a good sign in my opinion
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ihave never had to wait more then a couple of minutes for a table and if push comes to shove there is a small counter
FOOD	[ event ]	There is seating outdoors for the nicer days and they are constently changing the decorations to the season or athletic event
FOOD	[ O  ]	I keep coming back and have yet to be disappointed
FOOD	[ tabasco, habanero ]	If you like tabasco withyour meal you might want to bring your own as they will bring out a botle but it is the habanero type
FOOD	[ O  ]	It may be to hot for some palettes
FOOD	[ O  ]	I first heard of C's from a review in 77 Square or some such thing and thought I'd try it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've NEVER had a bad dish there
FOOD	[ bread, french toast, bread ]	 The bread for french toast is made in the restaurant - not pre-made and heated up, not store made bread, but real home made stuff
FOOD	[ waffles ]	 The belguim waffles are fresh - not the frozen-then-heated-up kind
FOOD	[ Egg, dishes ]	 Egg dishes are wonderful - lots of everything in the omelets, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The staff is really friendly and service, yes, can be a bit slow, but they are ALWAYS hopping!  I give them a break because of that
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I took the bf there for the first time on a Badger football Saturday and now I can't go anywhere else!! : )  Portions are huge (often have a box to go) and as others have mentioned, the bakery is amazing : )  
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ya Gotta Try It!!If asked a few months ago, I would have given them 4 stars
FOOD	[ breakfasts ]	Their breakfasts are awesome and homemade which is great, but they have a no substitution policy that knocks them down a notch
FOOD	[ eggs, hash browns, eggs ]	My husband doesn't eat eggs, and they refuse to give him extra hash browns, or at least take off the price of eggs
FOOD	[ O  ]	But it does have a great environment and they're otherwise friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're ever looking for a delicious breakfast on the west side of Madison, this is the place to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband and I were saying on the west side, but didn't want to pay the $20 surcharge at our hotel for meh hotel breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Instead, we looked around at our options, and found that C's was highly rated for breakfast, and not too far away
FOOD	[ O  ]	(Best of all, it was about 5 minutes away from our morning destination, I'm Board!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	The first day we came here, we sat outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	(The gramma/farm decor kind of threw me off
FOOD	[ blueberry, coffee, ham, onions, cheddar ]	) I had the blueberry pancakes with a side of hashbrowns and coffee, and my husband had an omlette with ham, onions, and cheddar & toast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious - I don't know the last time I had such wonderful food when eating out
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Even the coffee (and his pepsi!) were great
FOOD	[ brunch ]	They hit it out of the park so hard that we decided to come back on Sunday rather than heading downtown to another place for brunch that we found
FOOD	[ chocolate, banana, muffin, eggs, bacon ]	Sunday's breakfast, my husband had a repeat of Saturday's, and I had one of their specials - a chocolate/banana muffin, eggs, hashbrowns, and bacon
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was also tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I had to complain about anything, it'd be that C's is too far away for me to enjoy regularly  :)Update - this was the fourth or fifth visit to C's over the past few years; my coworkers have a breakfast club where we frequent various places once a month or so
FOOD	[ O  ]	The breakfast grub is straight-forward, no-nonsense, standard fare
FOOD	[ eggs, bacon, hash browns ]	Think: eggs, bacon, hash browns, pancakes, and skillets
FOOD	[ O  ]	Filling and satisfying
FOOD	[ breads ]	The breads remain excellent, as are the bakery items
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've bumped it up a star from the earlier review because the service has been stellar with our past few visits
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitstaff is friendly, attentive, and fast
FOOD	[ coffee ]	We've never waited for a refill of coffee or water - they're on it right away
FOOD	[ O  ]	Solid spot for diner breakfast fare in Middleton-- popular with the grandma and grandpa set
FOOD	[ all good, coffee ]	 Like all good diners, service is friendly, they keep the coffee cup full, and know how to crank through tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They've always been busy when we've been there (weekend mornings) but even when the wait looks long it's less than 10 minutes-- and once you're seated, service is quick
FOOD	[ Breakfasts, glaze, syrup ]	 Breakfasts are definitely of the "this is not healthy for you" variety, but it's good for a treat (I don't know how my kid made it through his cinnamon-swirl pancakes which were topped with the kind of glaze you put on cinnamon rolls, especially after he added syrup to it
FOOD	[ O  ]	)I was actually a bit disappointed by my latest experience at C's
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've had better
FOOD	[ O  ]	Typically I would give it a 3-star but some of the service wasn't the greatest and my food was cold
FOOD	[ O  ]	C's is the kind of family-friendly experience that makes it a 3 to 4 star restaurant on a good day, but on this particular day, our primary server was impatient and lacked a customer-first attitude and the quality of food was lacking
FOOD	[ coffee ]	However, the service for a never less then half empty coffee mug, was superb
FOOD	[ pecan, egg, sandwich, hash browns ]	I do love the bakery items so couldn't resist the pecan roll, but my egg sandwich with hash browns could have been better
FOOD	[ hash browns, croissant ]	The hash browns were cold and the croissant was dry
FOOD	[ bacon ]	The bacon however, crispy, just like I requested
FOOD	[ conversation ]	But, I was with my family, we were tucked in a cozy corner booth, had great conversation and due to the history of this restaurant and the many times I've been there before, it would be a place I would recommend
FOOD	[ O  ]	I guess the day I was there was just an "off day"
FOOD	[ O  ]	That happens
FOOD	[ O  ]	My favorite breakfast place in Madison, without question
FOOD	[ bread ]	Small town diner fare, but they bake their own bread and pastries
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great service and very affordable
FOOD	[ O  ]	I come here as often as I can
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't know what it is about this place, but they are slooooooooow
FOOD	[ fast food ]	The food is adequate (please don't lecture me about fast food, why are you even reading this review?), but sitting at the drive-in will shorten your life
FOOD	[ O  ]	Or maybe just feel like it
FOOD	[ O  ]	I prefer some of their stuff to McDonald's (yes, I'm very discerning) but just cannot abide the wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a Burger King
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My expectations were not that high
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, they are unbearably slow, and the dining area is usually pretty dirty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is mediocre, even for fast foot's low standards
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The staff usually acts like you're ruining their day for showing up
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good bk food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Slow service
FOOD	[ min ]	Drive through is a 10 min stop even if your the only one in line
FOOD	[ O  ]	Always feels like i am bugging the person at the window
FOOD	[ fast food ]	It's called fast food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not wait for three hours for a fricking burger food
FOOD	[ O  ]	WTF  how hard is it honestly?I have given this burger king a chance MANY times
FOOD	[ O  ]	But they are BY FAR the slowest burger king I have EVER been to
FOOD	[ O  ]	Even if they have no customers inside, and you go through the empty drive through, they will STILL make you pull forward and wait for your meal, one time it was over a half hour! Absolutely unreasonable
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would give this BK a -1 star if I could
FOOD	[ O  ]	They just recently renovated their building, cool, looks nice
FOOD	[ fast food ]	I've stopped going to this location, it is the worst in fast food
FOOD	[ meat, chicken, fish ]	Once i was told in the drive-thru that they were out of meat, but had chicken or fish
FOOD	[ meat ]	LOL Seriously! The king of burgers out of meat!?!?!? The wait in the drive-thru is painfully SLOW! I once ordered, waited for like 10-15 minutes, got fed up and left
FOOD	[ O  ]	Drove over to Wendy's, got my food and drove past BK on the way home
FOOD	[ O  ]	The truck i was behind in the drive-thru was still in the same spot! Crazy
FOOD	[ O  ]	This BK NEEDS better management and training for the employees
FOOD	[ O  ]	They just don't seem to care
FOOD	[ O  ]	AVOID AT ALL COSTS!Update: 8/26/12
FOOD	[ O  ]	8:30 A
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hangover
FOOD	[ cheese, cheese, onion rings ]	Ordered 2 Whoppers w/o cheese and 1 Whopper w/ cheese and 1 order of onion rings
FOOD	[ O  ]	Drive-thru
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had to pull ahead and wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	21 minutes later, a woman in a purple velvet one piece delivered our food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't they have work uniforms here? Jeeez
FOOD	[ O  ]	Having won a free small frapee from the "Family Food" giveaway at another Burger King, I decided to go inside the Sun Prairie location to cash it in
FOOD	[ O  ]	This was after I waited for almost twenty minutes at the drive-through, even after the order taker told me she'd be with me in, "just a second
FOOD	[ O  ]	" Inside the lobby, I was met by a scene of dirty tables, slow service, and a floor littered with a surprising ammount of plastic gloves
FOOD	[ O  ]	When I finally made it to the counter, I was amazed to learn that it is somehow possible to take my order without saying a single word to me, and then simply walking away without even handing me a reciept
FOOD	[ O  ]	Perhaps it was this same top-notch service and accuracy that caused another customer there to have to come back not once, not twice, but THREE times because they made his food wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	At this point, my instincts said to leave, but my honor required that I stick with it to the bitter end
FOOD	[ O  ]	But when I finally got the free frapee, I was saddened to say that it was not worth the wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you value your ability to eat at Burger King more than your time, I would suggest staying in your car at this location and living in blissful ignorance
FOOD	[ O  ]	As for me, it'll be a while before I have it my way again
FOOD	[ O  ]	22 minutes to get my order
FOOD	[ O  ]	Terrible service! I was the only one in the store when I placed my order although there were 3 cars in drivethru
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not acceptable! The only thing keeping this from getting a 1-star review is that (1) the restaurant was clean and newly remodeled, and (2) they did get the order accurate
FOOD	[ O  ]	again, after 22 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	not acceptable!Have been there several times and it's always super slow
FOOD	[ O  ]	It had been months since we had gone there so today we went there and the girl at the counter just finished a counter order, saw us, and went to drive through
FOOD	[ O  ]	We stood there for 15 minutes waiting for somebody to take our order
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fed up, we left and went to Culver's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Unless you like being ignored, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid! Stopped in for lunch today and the place was pretty much empty
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was a lady waiting at the counter for her order, two gentlemen who already had their order and were seated and eating
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was one worker for the front counter and the drive thru and 2 or 3 workers in the back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Waited over 10 minutes for someone to take my order and wasn't even acknowledged in that time
FOOD	[ fries ]	One of the guys came up front to bag drive thru orders, wiped the sweat off his face with a napkin, crumpled it up, tossed it in the trash and then scooped up fries without washing his hands
FOOD	[ O  ]	At that point I walked out and went to Culvers where I ordered and got my food in less time than I spent waiting to order here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not even worth one star!I went through the drive through, with about 4 cars ahead of me
FOOD	[ chickens ]	After placing my order, it took about 15 minutes just to get to the window, where I then waited 28 minutes being ignored! I know the exact time because I looked at the time stamp on my receipt! There were at least three cars waiting behind me too! I finally got the attention of the lady inside to see what the problem was, and I was just told that they are "short staffed" and they make the food fresh to order, Which I guess means they go out back and wait for the chickens to mature, slaughter them, and THEN make the nuggets! I asked for a manager, when she finally showed up, I was not given an apology, just the same story of being short staffed
FOOD	[ O  ]	At this point I had asked to just have my money back so that I could go elsewhere (still no food) and I was told by said manager that she doesn't know how to do that
FOOD	[ O  ]	so I waited
FOOD	[ milkshake ]	and finally (28 minutes later) got my food, which was cold, and my milkshake had long since melted
FOOD	[ O  ]	Waste of my time and money!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I did get a phone number also for what I was told the general manager, called, it was a cell phone with no name on the voicemail, left a message anyway, no return call
FOOD	[ O  ]	I won't ever be back, and I don't think they even care!Remember when Burger King was actually somewhat decent?  Pepperidge Farm remembers
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have dined with the King many a time across this fine land
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have watched their slow decline with sadness over the last thirty years
FOOD	[ O  ]	 At one point, they actually challenged the Clown for burger superiority, but now, they're a weak shadow on the market, barely a player
FOOD	[ O  ]	and the BK at this location is a perfect example of why
FOOD	[ O  ]	EVERYTHING at this BK takes ten minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Doesn't matter what you order, be prepared to wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's always dirty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When I was a kid and worked at the Clown, we were always cleaning
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There was usually one or two people on any shift whose sole job was to keep the lobby clean
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This place is a hole
FOOD	[ O  ]	Why does the food taste weird?  If I want BK, I actually make the drive to Deforest, rather than eat at this location, which is actually a stone's throw from my house
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food here tastes bad, bleachy, and wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What are they doing to the food?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fix thyself, King, and maybe I'll return
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Until then, I will take my cheap, poorly constructed eats elsewhere
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is slow beyond belief
FOOD	[ min ]	How do they stay in business? I waited 15 min for my order which was wrong and cold
FOOD	[ O  ]	I got the excuse "were short staffed"
FOOD	[ O  ]	There were two cars in line and no one in the dining area
FOOD	[ O  ]	How much staff do you need for two customers? I think they laugh about how bad they are as workers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Because they could care less
FOOD	[ pizza ]	Pretty ok pizza dudes
FOOD	[ Hearth, bread, gyro ]	 Not the best location, just off Main street, they share a tiny building with Country Hearth bread store, and a new gyro place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Teeny tiny parking lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That is all
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wow
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What a bunch of stoners
FOOD	[ Pizza, cheese, pizza ]	I had mentioned in a separate review that, per the website, this Pizza Pit doesn't have mac-and-cheese pizza
FOOD	[ gyros, cheese, pizza ]	Well, I went to get some gyros (they have a mini greek restaurant inside, apparently, called Athens) and saw on the board that they DO have the mac/cheese pizza
FOOD	[ O  ]	I stand corrected
FOOD	[ gyros ]	On to the gyros
FOOD	[ O  ]	The actual Greek restaurant in town is closed on Mondays, so we came here for our fix
FOOD	[ gyros, fries ]	We got gyros only, no fries (there aren't a lot of options, that might be it right there)
FOOD	[ tomatoes, onions, onions ]	They come with tomatoes and onions - I requested mine without onions
FOOD	[ O  ]	They were fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not stellar, not terrible
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've had better ones at a lot of places, but considering that I only had to drive ten minutes to get these, they were good enough
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was told 15 minutes, and when I got there 15 minutes (or so) later they were ready to go but still warm once I got them home and started devouring
FOOD	[ O  ]	What has the world done to the people in this place to make them hate life as they do?  And why does that translate to the mediocre food?  
FOOD	[ pizza ]	You can do better for pizza
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Hell, practically across the street from this place is Salvatore's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You'll spend a bit more, but it'll be worth it
FOOD	[ grease, cheese ]	This place slaps grease and cheese on cardboard, wraps it cardboard, and hands it to you with a look on their face that plainly says, "I should have listened to my teachers in high school
FOOD	[ O  ]	"I think their delivery service is pretty good, it was quick and the delivery guy was friendly
FOOD	[ pizza ]	And the lady I ordered my pizza through was VERY friendly and upbeat
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've heard a lot of bad things about their workers? But I always go around noon so maybe those people are just going at the wrong time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Who knows! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now onto the food
FOOD	[ pizza, pizza ]	Their pizza isn't the best pizza you'll ever have, but for the price it's good
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a little greasy sometimes, I'll admit
FOOD	[ cheese ]	But honestly I get the craving for them sometime! They have great cheese to put on their pizzas, and they usually put a good amount on
FOOD	[ O  ]	And I love their breadsticks! Yum! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Like I said though, there is better
FOOD	[ pizza ]	But if you're looking for cheap, quick, decent pizza I'd go here
FOOD	[ pizza, macaroni, cheese ]	I wanted pizza and my kids wanted macaroni and cheese, so I figured I'd head to the Pit
FOOD	[ O  ]	If only somebody had answered the phone! It was around 6pm on a Saturday night, which I understand is a busy time, but come on
FOOD	[ hung ]	I let it ring about 15 times and then hung up
FOOD	[ O  ]	I paced around my house for a few minutes, got distracted, then tried calling again about ten minutes later
FOOD	[ O  ]	Same deal: lots of ringing, no answering
FOOD	[ O  ]	I let it ring another 15 times or so and just gave up
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't mind having someone answer and then immediately put me on hold
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a lot better than the nothing that I got
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thumbs DOWN
FOOD	[ O  ]	Always good, friendly, and hot
FOOD	[ O  ]	My family likes this "Chinese" best in Sun Prairie
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is even better of you eat it "in"
FOOD	[ O  ]	Never full of customers (is that good?), it seems like they do a lot of take-out business
FOOD	[ O  ]	There is delivery
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not much updated decor
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good for when you want local basic Amer/Asian, same menu as all the rest
FOOD	[ O  ]	Some days it's better than others, but never bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	I ate there 2 times
FOOD	[ soup, shrimp, rice, noodle ]	I recommend sea food soup, spicy salty shrimp, Singapore rice noodle
FOOD	[ O  ]	The location is not that good
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's in Sun Prairie, a suburb area from Madison, WI
FOOD	[ O  ]	I believe if the location is in downtown Madison, it would be one of the top Chinese restaurant in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Panda Garden is the best place to get Chinese food in Sun Prairie
FOOD	[ O  ]	And they deliver which is a plus in my book! I've eaten in the restaurant a couple of times, but usually do take out
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never had anything I didn't like there (and we've tried a very good array of items)
FOOD	[ Garlic, Shrimp, Chicken, Lo Mein ]	Tonight we had the Garlic Shrimp and Chicken Lo Mein
FOOD	[ Garlic, Shrimp, flavor, crab ]	Both were awesome! The Garlic Shrimp had a nice spicy kick to it, but still had a TON of flavor! The crab Rangoon and pot stickers are also tasty!  Pricing is very reasonable for what you get!I love this place
FOOD	[ dumplings ]	The fried dumplings are to die for
FOOD	[ O  ]	Easy on-line menu, great selection and fabulous food
FOOD	[ soup, egg roll, chicken, broccoli ]	I ordered hot/ sour soup, egg roll and chicken/ broccoli
FOOD	[ O  ]	All of it was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't wait to go back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Every time my boyfriend and I eat here, it has been great
FOOD	[ dumplings, soup ]	We really enjoy the steamed dumplings and hot and sour soup
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff is very friendly, too
FOOD	[ chicken, shrimp, scallops, shrimp, chicken, scallops ]	I was unhappy due to having to wait 55 minutes for my one meal (steamed veggies combo with chicken, shrimp and scallops!  Then I get two pieces of shrimp, three small slices of chicken a few tiny scallops!!  For $12
FOOD	[ O  ]	00 that is a rip off, a joke and unacceptable!  You going to charge for food with those items in you better put more than sliced veggies!!  I will never come back!This is take out only
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have at least two locations that I am aware of
FOOD	[ O  ]	 One in Sun Prairie and one in Fitchburg
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have excellent Chinese food and the prices are pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best chinese I've found so far
FOOD	[ soup, won ton, soup ]	Hot and sour soup and their won ton soup are fantastic
FOOD	[ soup ]	Sometimes I'll go and just get the soup
FOOD	[ Crab ]	I haven't had better Crab Rangoon than they serve here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The people who work there are pretty nice, too
FOOD	[ boneless ]	The general tso's and boneless spare ribs are about as good as you'll find
FOOD	[ O  ]	No lie!Meh
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's okay when you want something quick
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not overly impressed
FOOD	[ Fried rice ]	Fried rice is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pretty bland for Chinese take out
FOOD	[ O  ]	We used to go here for our Americanized Chinese food every so often for the last 7 years
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, in the last year the quality of their food has taken a nose dive to unacceptable levels of blech and blah
FOOD	[ rice, vegetables ]	The rice and steamed vegetables were good, but that's about all we could tolerate
FOOD	[ O  ]	We ordered General Tso's, which is what we always get when we first try a Chinese restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	It helps us compare to other places
FOOD	[ chicken ]	The quality of the chicken used was awful
FOOD	[ dumplings ]	The dumplings were flavorless
FOOD	[ O  ]	We will not be returning
FOOD	[ O  ]	Awesome place to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their motto says it all, "little place, big flavors" or something like that
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's just really really good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is insanely good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Fresh meats and very, very tasty
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 When you order a sandwich (i recommend the godfather I or II), the owner goes to the fridge and begins slicing cuts for your sub
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Doesn't get much fresher than that
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have a few tables, but I've never eaten there so I cannot comment on the service but they are always friendly when I order take out
FOOD	[ sandwich, dishes ]	 In addition to a plethora of sandwich options there are italian dishes as well
FOOD	[ lasagna ]	 I've had the lasagna which was a large, flavorful portion
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Desserts are great too
FOOD	[ Cannoli ]	 Try a Cannoli
FOOD	[ O  ]	Deli Roma- Great Italian deli
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Large portions
FOOD	[ Sandwich ]	 Sandwich meats are slice to the order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Perfect tiny dining room with plastic red and white checkered table cloths
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Soooo good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Go there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Eat!Finally went to Deli Roma yesterday and so glad i did
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been meaning to go for a while but, always forget about it because of it's location
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's small but cool at the same time
FOOD	[ O  ]	All the Italian nostalgia in there is fun to look at while you wait
FOOD	[ panini, beef, hot dog ]	We got a veggie muffaletta, grilled panini, and a Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog
FOOD	[ O  ]	Veggie Muffaletta ($5
FOOD	[ flavor, olives, cheese, olive ]	25)~ Wow! So much flavor with the olives, 2 kinds of cheese, and the in house olive dressing
FOOD	[ bread, bread ]	Served on a 5" round Pane Mariano bread (my new favorite bread)
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	Great price for a huge sandwich
FOOD	[ Panini ]	Grilled Panini ($6
FOOD	[ panini ]	49)~ It was the panini of the week, not sure what it was
FOOD	[ meat, ham, salami, cheese ]	It had 2 kinds of meat( ham and salami i believe) and cheese
FOOD	[ focaccia, bread ]	The focaccia bread was grilled to perfection
FOOD	[ sandwich, meat ]	We got the order to go and it was still super hot when we got home! Tasty sandwich with a TON of meat in there!
FOOD	[ beef, hot dog ]	Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog ($2
FOOD	[ O  ]	75)~ Very good dog with all the fixings
FOOD	[ hot dog ]	Only complaint was that it was not very warm but that's OK with a hot dog i guess
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you can find this place you need to go! The mailman was eating lunch when we were there
FOOD	[ O  ]	I always think if the mailman eats there, you know it's good!Absolutely wonderful
FOOD	[ O  ]	IDK what the other guy was talking about complaining about the service
FOOD	[ conversation, old man, sandwiches ]	I was greeted with a smile and a friendly conversation while I waited for the old man to make my sandwiches
FOOD	[ O  ]	Reminds me of when I lived on the east coast
FOOD	[ Boar's head ]	Got to love Boar's head
FOOD	[ Boar's head, cheeses, sandwiches, olives ]	Boar's head meats and cheeses are what they use for their sandwiches, and they also have olives,and some other deli items
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	The sandwiches are great, and the service is friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	I miss their old employee John, he was such a charming, handsome young lad
FOOD	[ O  ]	:-( They even know Chris Burke!!!!Food was amazing!!! Just wish it were open on Sunday :)This place is the best
FOOD	[ O  ]	Americano is ridiculously good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Place is pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Have been here a handful of times
FOOD	[ Italian beef sandwich ]	I always get the Godfather (1 or 2) which is an Italian beef sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is really good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My wife really enjoys the Americano
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Overall I have not had any issues, except for my recent visit
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 There was an issue with one sandwich, called up and talked with the owner
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He was very understanding and wanted to make things right, so he gave me a $25 gift card to use the next time I'm there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I won't let one little issue stop me from eating here
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is a great stop for lunch
FOOD	[ sandwiches, meat ]	The sandwiches are huge and they use boars head premium deli meat on their subs
FOOD	[ O  ]	I challenge you to take down a whole one
FOOD	[ pasta, lasagna ]	They also make fresh pasta and lasagna that is to die for
FOOD	[ O  ]	Check This Place Out!We went here on a Saturday afternoon and no one was at the front counter
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's obvious that this is a small mom & pop type operation, which is encouraging because this usually means good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But we wouldn't know because no one ever came to the counter
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was one couple at a table eating, but no other customers at the time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There was a dude walking around in the back, he looked right at us, but didn't acknowledge us in any way
FOOD	[ O  ]	We stood there for quite a while and looked over the menu repeatedly, hoping that at any moment someone might come forth and say something as simple as "I'll be right with you" etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Didn't happen
FOOD	[ fast food ]	I get the whole idea of them not being fast food, and that good food takes time so on and so forth, but that shouldn't also mean "we will not acknowledge your presence
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Ever
FOOD	[ O  ]	"  
FOOD	[ O  ]	Three more people came in behind us and proceeded to wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There were then five of us crowding around the counter
FOOD	[ O  ]	waiting
FOOD	[ O  ]	and waiting
FOOD	[ O  ]	Here on Yelp I noticed that one complaint had a response from the business, which gives me some hope, but hey guys, I was there, with money in hand and you dropped the ball
FOOD	[ O  ]	again apparently
FOOD	[ O  ]	We walked out after waiting a longgggggg time for nothing
FOOD	[ O  ]	  We may try again some day when we have absolutely nothing better to do
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, if this is standard operating procedure I don't know that they'll still be around for that "some day
FOOD	[ beef, hot dog ]	"Only place in the area that makes an authentic Vienna beef Chicago style hot dog
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Simply awesome!Been in SP for a year now and only just discovered this place on my way home tonight
FOOD	[ fast food ]	Wanted something quick, tasty, and not from a fast food chain
FOOD	[ O  ]	Talk about a good stop
FOOD	[ sandwich, ham, salami, cheese, tomatoes, bread ]	My sandwich was just filled with Boars Head ham, salami, cheese, delicious fresh tomatoes all on excellent toasted bread
FOOD	[ meat, sandwich ]	Considering the amount of meat and the overall size of this sandwich the $7 and change price was more than reasonable
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm already looking forward to going back here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was pleasant and quick considering there were two people immediately in front of me
FOOD	[ fast food ]	 A unique gem in an area of SP dominated mostly by fast food joints
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Only wish they had better roadside presence so I had been able to find them sooner!This place is awesome! The food is amazing to say the least
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only time I have been disappointed is when I showed up on a Monday and found out they were closed
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best place for Italian in the area
FOOD	[ sandwich, Prosciutto ]	Thumbs up to the owner and staff, keep it up!Nice little sandwich shop in Sun Prairie and they do a decent job but they have big plastic things of Prosciutto to make them look like a big time Italian deli only one problem
FOOD	[ Prosciutto, sandwiches ]	they don't serve Prosciutto on any of their sandwiches and you can't even order it extra
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ Lasagna ]	They advertise that they have a couple of types of Lasagna and to ask for what they varieties are but they didn't have any when i was there
FOOD	[ sandwich, heat, bread ]	The sandwich I did have was good and they heat up bread that tastes very yummy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'll give them another chance
FOOD	[ O  ]	I never thought I would write a one-star review of Deli Roma, but I think this once-great deli's day has passed
FOOD	[ spaghetti ]	For the last year or so the food has been slipping and become mediocre - including, this fall, the worst plate of spaghetti I've ever been served in a restaurant (by an employee who is no longer there), but our experience on Saturday pretty much finished our long relationship with Deli Roma
FOOD	[ O  ]	We arrived around 4:30 p
FOOD	[ O  ]	and there was no one else in the deli
FOOD	[ O  ]	A young man was seated behind the register and greeted us, but did not get up
FOOD	[ beef, sandwich ]	We saw the specials board had an item which was a play on the Godfather, their signature Italian roast beef sandwich, and discussed whether we'd want to try it
FOOD	[ O  ]	During all this the gentleman behind the counter remained seated but appeared to be paying attention
FOOD	[ beef ]	When I said we were ready to order he got up, but when I ordered a Godfather he said that they were out of Italian beef
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway
FOOD	[ O  ]	The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients
FOOD	[ O  ]	If he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business
FOOD	[ O  ]	If they don't want our business, we won't give it to them any more
FOOD	[ O  ]	I found Deli Roma too late
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Fortunately, I was able to enjoy the godfather part I several times this winter before it closed
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 This was my favorite sandwich, anywhere, ever, period
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Sad to see you go, thank you for the delicious food!Ross, I hope you're going to show up somewhere else
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sure miss you in SP
FOOD	[ O  ]	Went here for a Father's Day breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Besides lunch and dinner, they also serve breakfast all day
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nice folks, darn good diner food, nice size portions
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Lots of old people come here, but they don't try to mug you in the bathroom or anything like that
FOOD	[ O  ]	Found  hair in my food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 BLECH!!  Never ever again!Good value
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Owners are always working and are good people
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They had a fire recently which closed the place down
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not sure they've re-opened yet, but if not, hopefully soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	I cannot wait until sir hobos open up again
FOOD	[ skillet ]	This place has the best breakfast anywhere!  The skillet are to die for
FOOD	[ O  ]	This service is as good as any diner in Chicago
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now reopen and beautiful
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Come in and check it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Absolutely horrible
FOOD	[ O  ]	The building has been recently remodeled because it burned
FOOD	[ cover, broom ]	 I'd guess the insurance company didn't cover a replacement broom, vacuum and cleaning supplies
FOOD	[ O  ]	My arms stuck to the new table, the floor was really littered with garbage and my silverware was dirty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Gross
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was 2pm on Sat and dead
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No excuse for dirty
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitress was really nice, I think her name was Sarah
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She was personable and attentive
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She's the only reason I'd give this place a star at all
FOOD	[ Gyro, sandwich ]	I ordered a Gyro sandwich
FOOD	[ fries, bowl, soup ]	 It came with fries and a bowl of soup
FOOD	[ Broccoli, Cheese, soup ]	 I ordered Broccoli Cheese soup
FOOD	[ gallon, broccoli, Hobo ]	 I think if I heated up some Velveeta and added a gallon of water to it, then tossed in a bunch of dirty, uncut broccoli, I could duplicate the Sir Hobo recipe
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wish the rest of the meal was that good
FOOD	[ Gyro, deer, fries ]	 When the Gyro arrived, it reeked of rotten deer carcass, the plate was filthy and the fries were colder than Alaska in December
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm not joking
FOOD	[ Gyro, glass ]	 The Gyro tasted so bad that I had to spit a mouthful of it into a napkin and slug down a glass of water to cleanse the horse-s--t taste from my mouth
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sarah noticed that I hadn't eaten my food, she offered to remove it from the bill with out me asking
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I would normally applaude that gesture, but some older foreign lady (I assume the owner) came over and told her not to do that
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 "I'll make you new sandwich," said the old lady
FOOD	[ O  ]	I declined
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I figured I couldn't choke down another bite of the garbage they call food
FOOD	[ liquid ]	 I paid my 9 dollars for a lousy cup of liquid Velveeta and left
FOOD	[ Hobo ]	I bet the Dairy Queen across the parking lot is glad that Sir Hobo's is back open
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I wonder how many people have done what I did
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	walk to DQ and had an ice cream cone to try to clean the aftertaste of death and decay from my mouth
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Never again
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'd go to DQ instead
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is always packed; however, the increased popularity is working against it
FOOD	[ O  ]	I took my mother, step father, and fellow siblings here for Mother's day
FOOD	[ O  ]	It took fifteen minutes just to get the attention of the waitress
FOOD	[ O  ]	When the food finally arrived three out of five of the orders were completely wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitress basically just negotiated back and forth with us until we agreed to eat what we were served
FOOD	[ O  ]	On a side note, the owner (older lady) kept staring at our table with a look in her eye that could have gotten her a role in the movie Scarface
FOOD	[ O  ]	Unfortunately, the owners no longer care about quality like they did before the business burnt down
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's just a numbers thing at this point
FOOD	[ O  ]	They lost a lifer that day
FOOD	[ O  ]	I recently went here with my family for breakfast and I look forward to going back soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu had many options for breakfast, even for Vegetarians, which I am
FOOD	[ Skillet ]	I had the Veggie Skillet which was delisious and my husband enjoyed his inlet as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	The portions where large and the quality was high
FOOD	[ O  ]	A very clean place with a very friendly wait staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good kids menu too!We used to live in Sun Prairie years ago when we first moved to Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The first place we ate at was Sir Hobos
FOOD	[ O  ]	 At the time, the menu was really basic and not much seemed to be "homemade"
FOOD	[ O  ]	 To be honest, we stopped going there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 As was mentioned below, there was a fire and they did a complete redo of the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food seems a bit better
FOOD	[ cheese, soup ]	 I do agree, though, with another "Yelper's" judgement on the cheese soup
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Yuk
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's so thick, it heaps up on the spoon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've eaten there a few times since the rebuild and it seems they are trying to change
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I hope they try a bit harder this time
FOOD	[ O  ]	A note:  No carpeting this time around
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's very noisy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And the TV's do not help
FOOD	[ O  ]	NEVER going back to this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We went for breakfast as a table of four
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was packed, Sunday morning breakfast
FOOD	[ breakfasts ]	 Three of the four breakfasts went back
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Two of those came wrong again
FOOD	[ O  ]	 One of those came back wrong a third time
FOOD	[ block, cheddar ]	 It took so long for the waitress to come back my wife had nibbled on it, eating around the block of Velveeta she specifically asked to be cheddar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When we asked for consideration on the bill, we were told that she had eaten it, so no discount would be given
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We asked to see the manager
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waitress returned and threw the bill on the table saying that she would take the breakfast out of her tips
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When we told the hostess, she offered a 10% discount off the bill
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Too Little Too Late
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There is no excuse for a menu omelet (that's right, not a special order, menu) to come out wrong three times
FOOD	[ O  ]	We went back here for the second time since the remodel
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Both times we had breakfast items
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We've never had lunch or dinner food here, and from reading other reviews it would appear that is a good thing
FOOD	[ O  ]	The remodeling looks nice, and it's now a no-smoking establishment
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But neither of these two aspects can apparently help the fact that your elbows and/or arms are going to stick to the tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Maybe it's a trap!  Like flies on sticky paper!  
FOOD	[ breakfast food ]	Service was good both times, and breakfast food is solid
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But if they can't keep the tables clean, what else is filthy dirty?I want to write nice things
FOOD	[ O  ]	I sooo want to write nice things
FOOD	[ O  ]	so here goes
FOOD	[ O  ]	the place has a nice warmth to it
FOOD	[ O  ]	family friendly, which is always a plus for us
FOOD	[ O  ]	well that's it
FOOD	[ O  ]	food- just not good
FOOD	[ corned beef ]	wife's reuben- the corned beef tasted
FOOD	[ O  ]	let's go with questionable
FOOD	[ hot dogs, Gyro ]	Kids got hot dogs, ugh, just buy a better brand people! I had the Gyro
FOOD	[ O  ]	it was serviceable, a little heavy on the sauce, but fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service- waitress didn't give a d*mn about anything
FOOD	[ O  ]	so yeah
FOOD	[ O  ]	2 stars
FOOD	[ brunch ]	maybe we will try again, but I don't think soWe went here for a family Christmas brunch last month
FOOD	[ Hobo ]	Having lived in town for nearly 20 years, we had always seen but never actually been to SIR Hobo's
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had no idea what we were missing
FOOD	[ O  ]	When we first sat down, we were greated by a jolly waitress with a thick, possibly Greek accent
FOOD	[ O  ]	Her nametag said her name was Gerestina, but her attitude said she loved her job
FOOD	[ O  ]	The complimentary water was, in a word, exquisite
FOOD	[ O  ]	And the meal only got better
FOOD	[ O  ]	But the biggest surprise was when, about 20 minutes into our meal, a homeless man with a whooping cough and a peg leg stumbled through the door and colapsed
FOOD	[ cook, mask, meat cleaver ]	The cook came crashing out of the kitchen, carrying a CPR mask in one hand and a bloody meat cleaver in the other
FOOD	[ cook ]	Through his quick action, the cook was able to resucitate the homeless man
FOOD	[ cook ]	As we all applauded, the homeless man stood up to shake the cook's hand
FOOD	[ bear ]	The homeless man was crying and gave every single person in the restaurant a great big bear hug
FOOD	[ hobo ]	It seems that SIR hobos still certainly cares for our fine city's hobo community
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place was recommended to us about, twenty miles away?
FOOD	[ O  ]	The loyal following is out of the local area
FOOD	[ O  ]	So we had to check this place out
FOOD	[ O  ]	The building:
FOOD	[ Hobo ]	The Hobo does live up to its theme; when you find it you will know it
FOOD	[ hobo ]	The inside is the standard dinner area, also the preferred seating for a hobo
FOOD	[ O  ]	Featuring large areas to set down, stretch out and down your jacket and bags
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can easily sit for more than twenty minutes and not worry about being run out (to make room for more customers)
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food:
FOOD	[ hobo ]	Any hobo would like this style of dining
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lots of different things, so you will not get tired of eating a lot at once
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also the shear amount will fill you up since a lot of hobos do not eat three meals a day
FOOD	[ O  ]	Again, you are not pressured to finish fast
FOOD	[ Hobo ]	This makes it much easier to finish the large portions the Hobo has to offer
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place would kill a Denny's, without even trying
FOOD	[ O  ]	Since I am not from the local area it is hard to compare it to anything locally
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yea, I would eat here again
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ehh
FOOD	[ O  ]	Probably wont return
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Friendly workers, beautiful restaurant but
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was NOT good at all
FOOD	[ O  ]	I dont know where to really start
FOOD	[ O  ]	I guess
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitress didnt get my order right
FOOD	[ O  ]	I ordered:
FOOD	[ BBQ, Bacon, onions, fries, salad, croutons ]	the burger with BBQ, Bacon, and onions, with seasoned fries and a side salad with croutons
FOOD	[ salad, croutons ]	 The salad came back without croutons, had to hunt the waitress down to get them
FOOD	[ Fries ]	 The Fries came back without any seasoning
FOOD	[ fries ]	and the fries tasted just awful!  The Burger wasnt too bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	Although, I think i would have rather have eaten a Bic Mac lol
FOOD	[ O  ]	My BF ordered:
FOOD	[ Hobo, Skillet ]	The Hobo Skillet with side of pancakes
FOOD	[ skillet ]	the skillet had a hair in it
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 it was really greasy and not much flavor
FOOD	[ flavor ]	and whatever flavor it did have it wasnt the greatest
FOOD	[ croutons ]	The best the best items we had  were the pancakes, and the croutons
FOOD	[ O  ]	I probably wont go back again
FOOD	[ O  ]	 :(It is what it is, a nice local diner-type place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's not going to knock your socks off, but it beats throwing money at chain restaurants and the food is usually above par
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is just great! We have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it has been great every time
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is so cheap and you always get so much food and so
FOOD	[ O  ]	fast to
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have a huge menu which is awesome! The workers are always so happy and take good care of you! They just remodeled it and it looks so nice inside and the bathrooms are always clean
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great place!Blech
FOOD	[ buffet ]	 My brother heard this was the best Chinese buffet in Sun Prairie
FOOD	[ buffet ]	 Maybe that is true, but it must be the only Chinese buffet in Sun Prairie
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not giving it a hard time for "authenticity" or any of that eaither
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I love me some good Americanized, crappy Chinese food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Here, even the stuff that was out fresh from the kitchen (which was mighty slim picken's) was barely edible
FOOD	[ buffet ]	I was really looking forward to some good old MIdwestern Chinese buffet, too
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The Chinese food options in Portland are actually very lacking, the last really good stuff I had was from a strip mall in Crawfordsville, IN
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Seriously, they can do it right but everyone else serves lukewarm, tasteless piles of mystery?  Gotta be kidding me
FOOD	[ O  ]	Most options seemed to have been sitting for way too long when we got here, and it was peak dinner eating time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I should have been tipped off by the low number of patrons at this "best Chinese" but I like to give the benefit of the doubt
FOOD	[ Ramen noodles ]	You are better off making Ramen noodles at home and calling it chinese food
FOOD	[ buffet ]	This place is both a buffet and a takeout restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	For take out, it's great
FOOD	[ buffet ]	As a buffet, it's okay
FOOD	[ buffet ]	The food is always fresh and the buffet is refreshed constantly so nothing sits out very long
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's nothing fancy, but it's good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not great
FOOD	[ O  ]	But good
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a favorite for take out while living out in the boonies!I love this place
FOOD	[ buffet ]	 The food is always fresh, they keep an eye on the buffet so they can refill the trays quickly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've never had anything here that wasn't great
FOOD	[ O  ]	UPDATE:  This place closed down about a year ago
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Sadness
FOOD	[ buffet ]	Another mom and pop Chinese buffet goes by the wayside of stretching themselves too thin
FOOD	[ buffet ]	I resisted going here for the past several years that I've lived in Sun Prairie b/c of all the other mediocre Chinese food buffet restaurants I've eaten at that left me a bit disappointed
FOOD	[ dishes ]	Their selection is less in numbers of dishes than other places around the Dane County area; however, in terms of quality and freshness, it's rather good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Since other reviewers did not go into significant detail about the offerings, I'll mention my first time experience recently on a Sunday (where there were about three other tables of diners):
FOOD	[ peanut butter, chicken ]	- peanut butter chicken
FOOD	[ beef ]	- mongolian beef
FOOD	[ chow mein ]	- chow mein
FOOD	[ sushi ]	- a few sushi rolls (x2 varieties)
FOOD	[ crab ]	- crab rangoons (better than average)
FOOD	[ spring rolls ]	- spring rolls (eggrolls, more aptly)
FOOD	[ popcorn, shrimp ]	- popcorn shrimp
FOOD	[ egg ]	- two types of soups - your basic hot and sour or egg drop (these were just OK)
FOOD	[ chicken, skewers, appearance ]	- chicken skewers (these were excellent even though I didn't expect them to be based on appearance)
FOOD	[ seafood ]	- seafood stir fry w/ veggies
FOOD	[ fish, fillets ]	- fish fillets
FOOD	[ dessert, fruit, pudding, jello ]	- dessert options looked like a few types of cakes and fruit, pudding, and jello
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like the emphasis on quality rather than quantity
FOOD	[ O  ]	And this place was clean
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's tucked away in a strip mall by Walmart, so points against it for location
FOOD	[ beat, buffet ]	 But you can't beat the price, $7-8 for a buffet meal!  Of course, afterwards, I had to nap off the food coma 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have been eating here for at least 7 years and it's excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Typically a group of us go there for lunch coming from work
FOOD	[ pepper, chicken, broccoli, chicken ]	  I love the pepper chicken the broccoli and the chicken on a stick things
FOOD	[ peanut butter, chicken ]	 Ohh yes, the peanut butter chicken is also excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My 4 kids really love going there too when we happen to be in that area on a weekend
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They've been going there every now and then since they were babies
FOOD	[ O  ]	   
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have heard that they may not be able to renew their lease as that part of the strip mall may be changed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That would be very disappointing
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have been a loyal staple spot for years while stores with in the mall have changed some of which are still vacant
FOOD	[ O  ]	  If you have not checked them out give them a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you enjoy them go back for a visit incase they are soon gone
FOOD	[ O  ]	closed
FOOD	[ O  ]	This restaurant was forced to close due to a greedy landlord that suddenly doubled their rent, probably because of the upgrades done with the new Walmart
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Does anyone know where this family went or if they opened in another location?  I would gladly go to the the one
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I haven't found any Chinese food as good
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	Good old fashioned diner food with a generous all you can eat prime rib and butterfly shrimp on Saturdays
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have been here twice, both times for breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Both times I was *very* happy
FOOD	[ omelette, feta, cheese, spinach, omelette ]	I had the greek omelette (feta cheese, spinach, you know the deal) and thought I had died and gone to omelette heaven
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best I ever had
FOOD	[ omelette ]	It came with this delicious tzaziki-type sauce on the side, which I should have brought home with me (I did finish the omelette at the restaurant)
FOOD	[ strawberry, fritter, french toast ]	The second time I had this very interesting strawberry fritter french toast
FOOD	[ french toast ]	I love french toast and all things sugary, and this was definitely sweet
FOOD	[ strawberry ]	It sort of had a filling (that was the strawberry part)
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was delicious, but not for those who claim they don't like sweets
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is terrific, very fast and genuine
FOOD	[ coffee ]	The coffee is hot and just right
FOOD	[ O  ]	You'll likely be surrounded by various old men (with the occasional younger man sprinkled in), but these old guys know a good breakfast when they find one
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you have not been here go
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best breakfast in Dane county
FOOD	[ O  ]	I work out of state and every time I get to town this is my first stop
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I get in town at 2 am I am up at 7 for breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bring and tell your friends you wont regret it
FOOD	[ O  ]	How pleasantly surprised I was to find this old school greasy spoon ( and I say that as a compliment)
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is the kind of place I remember fondly from my youth in NJ
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No pretension, no gimmicks, just honest food done well
FOOD	[ cilantro, chorizo, onions ]	 I had one of the specials - an omelet with cilantro, chorizo, green and red peppers and onions
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was perfect
FOOD	[ potatoes ]	 Perhaps my favorite part about my breakfast was the hash brown potatoes
FOOD	[ O  ]	At many places like this, they are soggy and undercooked
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not only were they spiced well, but they were crispy as well
FOOD	[ potatoes ]	 That's no joke with breakfast potatoes!    In any case, I've been back twice in a week and a half, and plan on returning often
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Don't let the exterior or decor fool you; they make good food in that tiny building
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love local hometown eateries
FOOD	[ O  ]	So when we were looking for a place for lunch while on the road, the Prairie Diner called out to us
FOOD	[ O  ]	Inside looks like a 50s diner with stainless steel lunch counter and cozy booths
FOOD	[ O  ]	Judging by the area around it, it can be that old but at least it looks authentic
FOOD	[ cook ]	 The service was prompt and friendly, even the cook greeted us when we walked in the front door which appears to be the back door as you enter near the back of the kitchen and restrooms
FOOD	[ cook ]	The young cook even said thank you on our way out
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't think I've ever seen that before, I figured he must be the owner
FOOD	[ omelette ]	The wife ordered the ultimate omelette, I had the perch lunch
FOOD	[ eggs ]	They even had a perch breakfast on the menu that comes with eggs
FOOD	[ O  ]	Only in Wisconsin! The atmosphere and service made you feel right at home
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was just average
FOOD	[ O  ]	We're not complaining, other things are as important as the food in a restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Much more memorable than a stop at McDonald's next door
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is just a tiny restaurant with a real family feel
FOOD	[ O  ]	We came for a late breakfast on a Sunday
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitstaff were quick to help us
FOOD	[ O  ]	We chose seats at the counter
FOOD	[ biscuits, gravy ]	There were many specials, breakfast, lunch, soups, biscuits and gravy, lots of diner food
FOOD	[ O  ]	We sat among the regulars and were treated like one of the family
FOOD	[ eggs ]	The husband had eggs, hashbrowns and toast-all cooked to perfection
FOOD	[ pancake, dessert ]	I had a pancake that was huge and so delicious-just like dessert for breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	The prices are reasonable, the food plentiful and the atmosphere is very friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing fancy, just good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	We will be going back
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband and I stopped in here on a freezing Sunday morning
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's a small place,  but doesn't seem too crowded
FOOD	[ eggs benedict ]	 We had eggs benedict, and it was VERY good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices  they charged were more than reasonable for the quality of food,   and the waitstaff was super nice
FOOD	[ coffee, cream, sugar, coffee ]	As people who drink coffee black,  it's very hard to find small places like this that you need no cream or sugar to make the coffee palatable,  and luckily this was one such place
FOOD	[ O  ]	So really,  nice atmosphere, good food, nice waitstaff,  don't even bother going anywhere else for breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would move closer to this place if it was an option
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have enjoyed, more than I can say, everything I've eaten here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had friends in town so ended up going there two mornings in a row
FOOD	[ meat, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions ]	Saturday I had the Veggie Benedict (instead of the meat layer, it's a mix of tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and peppers)
FOOD	[ Eggs Benedict ]	I love a good Eggs Benedict and always try the different versions, but this is the best ever
FOOD	[ omelette ]	Sunday I went back to my old friend, the greek omelette, and it was as good as ever
FOOD	[ O  ]	We sat in a booth on Saturday and then at the counter on Sunday
FOOD	[ coffee ]	The coffee was hot and constantly being topped-up
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a Sun Prairie tradition
FOOD	[ O  ]	Local folks running a local diner
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is good with very down to earth service
FOOD	[ dark meat, cheese ]	We went to this store at 8 pm they close at 10pm they were out of dark meat in crispy, they had no mac and cheese made
FOOD	[ chicken, cheese ]	 they did let us get some extra chicken because we wanted three sides of mac and cheese
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The people who woked here tried very hard but just didnt seem to know what was going on
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We went in for two 10 peice buckets and it took us more then a half hour to get what we needed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 this is the second time we had been there and the service was terrible both times
FOOD	[ O  ]	The last time I went in there I observed: cross contamination, unfriendly service(no two part greeting), dirty rag BUCKETS left ON THE COUNTER where they set the tongs for serving food, no hand washing by employees, and confusion with my order although it was a simple one consisting of 12 strips
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, another customer came in while I was waiting and asked if they could prioritize her order because she was in a hurry
FOOD	[ O  ]	They said yes, but it resulted in a lot of confusion between employees which drastically slowed service time
FOOD	[ O  ]	The customer complained about the wait, which resulted in an indifferent response from a employee
FOOD	[ O  ]	He said "if you wanted your order faster you should have called it in"
FOOD	[ O  ]	He said this with an attitude
FOOD	[ O  ]	Then he turned to me and asked if I thought he handled that correctly, and I said no
FOOD	[ O  ]	In the end, being a former employee of this establishment, I was very disappointed with the cleanliness and customer service
FOOD	[ O  ]	This location does not have good service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Went through drive-through and they forgot our drinks and our sides
FOOD	[ O  ]	While they were preparing what they forgot, we could see another girl who had her back to us and it was obvious that she was on her phone
FOOD	[ O  ]	Any other KFC would be better
FOOD	[ O  ]	Inexpensive, friendly, tasty diner
FOOD	[ Cafe ]	I was in town last week, and my friend suggested we meet up at the Country Cafe
FOOD	[ french toast, sausage, coffee ]	I got the cinnamon roll french toast with a side of sausage links and coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	We spent about three hours talking there (all the way from breakfast to lunch!) but the servers were completely gracious about it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our grand total after downing a ton of food was a little over $12 for both of us
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yay for specials!
FOOD	[ O  ]	From the outside, it is not the most scenic of  restaurants, but inside is what counts!Well how-deee ya'll!!  
FOOD	[ Cafe ]	Are you 90 years old?  Do you live in or around Sun Prairie?  Well then you must hang out at the Country Cafe!  Everybody from the old folks home was here tonight
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Most of the time, I love old people, and here is why
FOOD	[ brake ]	 They are old enough now, that they will say what they want and not think twice, you know why?  Cuz they are old, and what are you gonna do?  Take away their walkers?  Take the brake off their wheelchairs?  Hell no you ain't!  
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am drawn to slightly inebriated old ladies and goofy old dudes who spend the evening talking at length about mosquitoes and hip replacements
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Hey look!!  There is a guy over in the corner with all his teeth on the table, and another dude with a dog hidden under the table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That man over there is pushing an empty wheelchair around in circles!  It's like a geriatric wonderland, and I am Alice!  
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food here is just ok, but the prices are very cheap, and the service is excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wanna be awesome when I'm 90
FOOD	[ breakfasts ]	 *crossing my fingers*Great place for great breakfasts and service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Home cooked and friendly competent staff
FOOD	[ cafe ]	Good inexpensive cafe food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pleasant waitresses
FOOD	[ O  ]	Things on menu you won't find in franchise restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	My next-door neighbor, who is 84 and has lived in Sun Prairie all her life, recommended this place for breakfast
FOOD	[ chickens ]	It has some very kitschy decor (basic small-town breakfast restaurant style) with lots of gingham and wooden chickens, but I didn't care
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing on the menu looked very exciting, and it seemed like everything cost a dollar or two more than I would have expected
FOOD	[ coffee, mushroom, cheese ]	But the waitress was extremely nice, the coffee was good, and the food (I got the mushroom and cheese omelet) was great
FOOD	[ cheese ]	My omelet had three (3!) kinds of cheese and lots of nice 'shrooms inside
FOOD	[ hash browns, choice, muffin ]	It was terrific and also came with hash browns and my choice of toast/pancakes/muffin
FOOD	[ rye ]	I got the rye toast, as always
FOOD	[ O  ]	We got there around 8:30am (on a weekday) and almost had the place to ourselves but more people kept trickling in as we ate
FOOD	[ O  ]	I live in Colorado and was returning home to Wisconsin for a wedding
FOOD	[ O  ]	So happy to find this amazing little diner off of Highway 151
FOOD	[ O  ]	A hardy old-fashioned breakfast with real food and friendly serviceGreat experience
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	 Great ice cream
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Always a good alternative to the restaurant across the parking lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	DQ rocks
FOOD	[ O  ]	I cannot recommend DQ's food
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is edible but not great
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	But who on earth goes here for anything but ice cream? They have a pretty good selection of grab-and-go stuff in the freezer by the door, and there is a drive-through
FOOD	[ O  ]	The inside is very small, and they close up for a month (I want to say January), I'm guessing for the owners to snowbird it
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	Every ice cream item I've ever gotten from here has been great
FOOD	[ pumpkin ]	I had a pumpkin Blizzard in the fall that was DELISH
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are the first car through the drive-through you should count your lucky stars
FOOD	[ Peanut ]	If you aren't the first then you might have quite a wait (understandable, since the car in front of you might be ordering Peanut Buster Parfaits for the entire marching band and you'd never know until it was too late)
FOOD	[ age, ice cream ]	A couple of times I've dealt with employees who seemed to hate me and whatever I was ordering (the median age of these people seems to be about 19), but the ice cream was still great 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Other times I've had extremely friendly and happy-seeming people at the window/register
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	Again, yummy ice cream
FOOD	[ O  ]	This DQ location has an update: they are now paired with Orange Julius and so had to get rid of the fryers
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm fine with that; I'm just there for the sugary treats anyhow
FOOD	[ O  ]	I try not to visit this place too often, as it is completely unredeemable nutritionally
FOOD	[ flavor, Lemon, Meringue ]	But so yummy! Anyway, I was intrigued by the Blizzard flavor of the month (or, as the sign says, the BLIZZ FLAV): Lemon Meringue
FOOD	[ O  ]	So I buckled the kids in the minivan and headed out
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's summer vacation, so I don't feel bad about having them out after 9pm
FOOD	[ O  ]	It seems like most of Sun Prairie felt the same way, because when we got there we were the sixth car or so in line for the drive-through
FOOD	[ O  ]	Instead of waiting forever in line with the engine running I parked in the miniscule lot and walked in
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was then second in line behind some squirrely teenage girls
FOOD	[ O  ]	There were three young people working, and they were seriously running their arses off
FOOD	[ O  ]	The young woman who helped the teen in front of me and then me was nothing but professional and courteous
FOOD	[ Lemon, Meringue, Mint ]	My Blizzards were perfection (Lemon Meringue and Mint Oreo)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I docked a star just because the place is so squished
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm embarrassed to be writing this review
FOOD	[ O  ]	Why, you ask? 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Well it means coping to a number of things: 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was at Dairy Queen
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll stop there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Naw, I'll keep going
FOOD	[ O  ]	Even though I'm lactose intolerant, there's just something about a blizzard I can't say no to
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes, even Yelp's lover of local winds up at a chain every now and again
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's usually during a dark period or when I'm leaving a meeting in Sun Prairie and I drive by the only DQ I know of in Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	The basis for my low rating is a terrible blizzard that crushed all my blizzard dreams
FOOD	[ chicken, white bread ]	The real basis for my low rating is the fact that they took out friers, so gone are the days of crisp "chicken" fingers and white bread
FOOD	[ baskets, white bread ]	seriously why were the baskets served with white bread? 
FOOD	[ skim milk ]	At the end of the day, the product, and I mean water, maaaaaybe skim milk and flavoring just didn't meet my expectations as blizzards have before
FOOD	[ Brazier, hot dog, hot dog ]	(I told you, I'm embarrassed) Add to this the fact that when it comes to "Brazier" all you can get is a hot dog swimming in funky hot dog water and there's little to no reason for me to stop here anymore
FOOD	[ O  ]	I want to take this opportunity to apologize to Michael's, Culver's and most of all Kopps in Milwaukee
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll never stray again
FOOD	[ O  ]	You shouldn't either
FOOD	[ O  ]	All excited about the tostadas
FOOD	[ ice ]	When I received them they were ice cold
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only reason for the three stars was the service was super friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good bar and the food is ok not remarkable but good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Portions sort of skimpy but they ar ealways expanding the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They do have a pretty good Rib eye however but nothing else was that memorable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I will eat there again I'm sure
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great food, new management, greatly improved
FOOD	[ O  ]	The wings are very good
FOOD	[ fish ]	The fish fry is top notch, the Walleye is very good too
FOOD	[ Pizza ]	Stuck in Lodi for the day, I couldn't find a place for lunch, and I dared not to try "The Pizza Pit" in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	I thought I'd head east and come here for lunch since I didn't find anything better
FOOD	[ O  ]	Years ago, this used to be a place called Stockade and I loved it
FOOD	[ grill ]	Now it's a Badgers/Packers bar and grill
FOOD	[ cheese ]	Visible from I-90, just west of Madison, there's a cheese place (Mouse Haus I believe) and warehouses for Pepsi and Walgreen's nearby
FOOD	[ Grill ]	The Rodeside Grill resembles a log cabin style fort from the outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	Years ago, this place used to be called Stockade
FOOD	[ O  ]	Once inside, it's quite spacious with high ceilings and an all wood interior, except for the tile on the floor
FOOD	[ O  ]	The whole place looks very clean, not grungy and aged like so many bars in Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	I sat down to eat at the bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	All along the bar counter, there were blurbs and excerpts of Packers and Badgers accomplishments underneath the laminated countertop
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place even had green-colored ductwork, so I knew I was deep in Packers territory
FOOD	[ game ]	A big screen TV aired game highlights from the Packers-Saints NFL season opener from the day before
FOOD	[ body ]	Large men with mustaches came in for lunch, typical Wisconsin body types
FOOD	[ fish ]	I kept a low profile and my Chicago origin and calmly requested the Friday fish fry special
FOOD	[ O  ]	Having traveled up north on many occasions, this wasn't the first time I was surrounded by Packer fans
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's not hard to deal with them if you don't disclose where you're from and stick to the menu items or make a positive comment about Jordy Nelson being an awesome rising star on the team
FOOD	[ fish, fries ]	The fish arrived in a few minutes and it came with a side of fries that were seasoned and coated - quite tasty in fact
FOOD	[ Coleslaw ]	Coleslaw is also a can't-miss item north of Illinois and this place has it right too
FOOD	[ O  ]	I found the meal quite enjoyable
FOOD	[ iced tea ]	The bartender got me another iced tea and then spent a few more minutes of admiring the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Packers highlights gave way to NASCAR on the TV, but I was on my way, 150 miles from Chicago once again
FOOD	[ fish ]	While I went for the fish, Rodeside also has some good burgers, from what I saw around me at lunch that day
FOOD	[ O  ]	Worth a stop on your way to the Dells or Lodi for that matter
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just leave the Bears stuff in the car
FOOD	[ O  ]	We broke down on the road and and eat here we had a very good meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	We would stop here again
FOOD	[ O  ]	Met a client there for lunch and I thought the food was good
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is located right off the highway so it is easy to get to
FOOD	[ O  ]	There is a private lot which makes parking easy and they did have lots of options on the menu
FOOD	[ beef, sandwich ]	I had the philly beef sandwich that was pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	The other plus is they have lots of daily specials every day
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not sure when I would be back but I would not hesitate to bring a client there or eat lunch there if I found myself in the area
FOOD	[ Grill ]	Went to check out the Rodeside Grill for breakfast last Saturday with a group
FOOD	[ O  ]	Most of us haven't been there before but we heard good things from friends and saw the Breakfast menu online and thought we should try it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Got a super warm greeting at the door and seated immediately
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had a nice dining area separate from the bar area and was clean an spacious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our group was rather chatty so it took us a while to order but the waitress was very nice and patient
FOOD	[ O  ]	I got the Southwestern Omelet with pancakes - a little spicy but good
FOOD	[ french toast, eggs ]	Others in our group got the french toast and one got prime rib and eggs
FOOD	[ O  ]	All were happy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yummy food and good portions
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cost was decent - and we all got $ off for checking in on Facebook! We were very pleased and are planning on coming back again to try dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is average, but for the prices they charge, it should be better
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nice atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife and I discovered Roadside while house hunting in the area
FOOD	[ O  ]	simply put
FOOD	[ O  ]	good food, atmosphere and friendly and efficient service!!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Highly Recommended!!Bar is okay and the atmosphere is nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food is below average and pricey
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our food was cold and when we commented on that the sever didn't seem to care
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great restaurant!  A group of seven of us ate at this restaurant last Saturday
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The location is very convenient
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The ambiance is very casual, yet nice
FOOD	[ sandwiches, pasta, fish ]	 The menu has a nice variety (sandwiches/burgers/pasta/fish)
FOOD	[ pasta ]	I had a the bowtie pasta, which the menu said was spicy and it was
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not too incredibly hot you couldn't eat it, but it diffenetly had a nice bite
FOOD	[ soup, salad ]	 It came with a soup or salad and was more than enough food
FOOD	[ fish, sandwich, tortilla, pork ]	Others in our party had a fish sandwich, tortilla encrusted tilapia, burito, pork roast and a couple of salads
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All were very satisfied with their dinners
FOOD	[ O  ]	I disagree with other users that the prices are high
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I found them to be extremely reasonable for the quantity and quality of food you are given
FOOD	[ wine ]	Beers/wine also seems to be reasonable
FOOD	[ glass ]	 I had a glass of pinot grigio and it was only $4
FOOD	[ O  ]	95
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was extremely impressed with the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The restaurant was busy and our waitress told us a large order had just came in and she apologized for the wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Despite all of the people in the restaurant, our wait was not excessive
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wish I lived closer
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is worth going to again!Great service here and really good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	The dairy is from a local farm
FOOD	[ Cow, cheese, curds, cheese ]	I had the Sassy Cow cheese curds made with cheese from a local farm and the smokehouse burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	Make sure you try their ranch, it's also made in house
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our server, Roxy, was world class
FOOD	[ fries ]	Docking 1 star because the fries weren't too tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	The ranch definitely saved them
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't go in the Drive Thru if there are more than 3 cars
FOOD	[ O  ]	You will sit there for 20 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lifetime favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	Restaurant was recently renovated,  added more seating, and updated decor
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love me some A&W
FOOD	[ fast food ]	  Best fast food out there and there needs to be more of them!This location always prepares everything well, fresh, fast, and they are friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	I visit here from work in Sun Prairie, maybe once every couple of weeks
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	 My normal selection is the Coney Dog Combo but with cheese curds
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	 Kind of on the expensive side (give the cheese curds substitution), at $8
FOOD	[ O  ]	00 and some change, but a nice alternative from the same old crap
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	The cheese curds are awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They are soft and have a light coating of breading (probably just flour), compared to Culver's, which is more breading than crust, and normally not even melted
FOOD	[ fast food ]	I'd recommend going here if in the area and in the mood for some better fast food
FOOD	[ O  ]	I enjoy this place everytime I go in there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its family owned and has consistently good food
FOOD	[ crab ]	Large soda selection with  awesome crab rangoon
FOOD	[ beef, pork, chicken, crab, brown sauce ]	My favorite dish is the Happy family which has beef, pork, chicken, crab, and veggies in brown sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	Way too sweet for my liking
FOOD	[ O  ]	Real authentic Chinese food isn't always sweet
FOOD	[ candy, dip, corn syrup ]	In my opinion, if you like sweet taste this much, might as well eat candy bar dip in corn syrup as a meal
FOOD	[ food coloring ]	When I ordered my food a few years back from them, they put too much food coloring so much that it looked yellow
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was not appealing to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	But it has been years I haven't been there so they could have improved and better
FOOD	[ O  ]	I sure hope that's the case
FOOD	[ O  ]	As far as take-out places go in Madison, this is my favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	Consistently tasty, fair prices, large portions, and friendly employees
FOOD	[ general tso's chicken ]	I am eating microwaved general tso's chicken from last night and it is still awesome
FOOD	[ dumplings, egg rolls ]	Excellent steamed dumplings and egg rolls
FOOD	[ dumplings, rock, soup ]	The fried dumplings rock!One liner for quick reads:  Fresh made Hot and Sour soup!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes
FOOD	[ Soup ]	they make the Hot and Sour Soup when you order it
FOOD	[ gelatinous, leftovers ]	no gelatinous, nasty leftovers here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service can be a little slow, but definitely worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good overall food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our favorite Chinese takeout
FOOD	[ O  ]	 (note
FOOD	[ O  ]	we always pick up, so I cannot comment on the delivery)It was delicious, but expensive for delivery
FOOD	[ cashew, chicken, meat, crab ]	I had the cashew chicken (no veggies, so they gave me extra meat - thumbs up!), crab rangoon and a 2-L of soda
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very friendly staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	We go here religiously whenever we are craving Chinese take-out (which happens a lot!) I could imagine this place is overlooked but it seriously has some of the best food in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service is fast and the food comes out consistently great every time
FOOD	[ pork, fried rice ]	Order the pork fried rice, you won't regret it
FOOD	[ pomegranate, passion fruit ]	Singapore dish was perfect!! And they even had my favorite nestea pomegranate & passion fruit 
FOOD	[ sesame, chicken, crab ]	Huge portions also!Good stuff!  Had the sesame chicken, general tsa, pot stickers, and crab Rangoon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All were great, and were ready quickly
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pretty good for takeout
FOOD	[ meat ]	The meat is more sound than usual Chinese take outMy daughter and I stopped in last night for the first time
FOOD	[ Chicken, Chop Suey, Chicken ]	 I had the Chicken Chop Suey and she had Sweet & Sour Chicken
FOOD	[ Dumplings ]	 We started with an order of Steamed Dumplings
FOOD	[ dumplings ]	 The dumplings were great
FOOD	[ meat ]	 They had a lot of meat in them
FOOD	[ Chop Suey ]	 The Chop Suey was made with a white sauce
FOOD	[ brown sauce ]	 I am used to it being made with a brown sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That did not matter as it was delicious
FOOD	[ Chicken ]	 The S&S Chicken was wonderful as well
FOOD	[ food coloring ]	 The S&S sauce that came with it was not laden with all that bright red food coloring
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very tasty
FOOD	[ Egg Roll ]	  She also got an Egg Roll
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was huge!  We had to split it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Niiice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And, even though you order and pick your food up at a counter, the service was great
FOOD	[ Chicken ]	 I ordered a Chicken Lo Main to go for my son and she asked me if I wanted them to wait a bit before they cooked it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I like that!  That tells me that they care about our experience after I pay them!!  A plus!  We've passed this place up numerous times
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not any more
FOOD	[ Chicken, Fried Rice ]	 We'll be back!Still good but I tried the Chicken Fried Rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Don't bother
FOOD	[ chicken ]	 The chicken was tasteless
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All they did was steam it
FOOD	[ rice ]	 The seasoning was all in the rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Disappointing
FOOD	[ fried rice ]	 I thought fried rice was an industry standard
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband and I came in Saturday night to dine in
FOOD	[ O  ]	(Can't say that's a very popular option, but I was starving)
FOOD	[ crab ]	While we were waiting, we were given complimentary crab rangoon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The restaurant is owned by a couple who are incredibly kind
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It made me all warm and fuzzy being customers at such a lovely family establishment
FOOD	[ crab, crab ]	The crab rangoon was piping hot and filled with cheesy, crab goodness
FOOD	[ soup, broth ]	The hot and sour soup was incredibly substantial with tons of veggies and delicious broth
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was extra thick and perfect on a cold and windy day
FOOD	[ shrimp, chicken, lo mein ]	My entree was shrimp and chicken lo mein which I totes recommend
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	 The shrimp was not overcooked and the noodes were packed again with tons of veggies
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ O  ]	People are nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices are good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is huge, and tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I didn't live on the West side, I'd be here every week
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best Chinese take-out in town
FOOD	[ pork, egg rolls ]	They have the best pork egg rolls I've ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	The woman who answers the phone and works the counter doesn't speak English very well and yells a lot but I'm willing to put up with that considering their food is so good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pretty decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	But I think all Chinese in Madison is pretty decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing has truly blown me away, this place included
FOOD	[ fried rice, chicken, flavor ]	While staff is nice and carryout is quick, food I ordered (veggie fried rice and Mongolian chicken) just didn't have much flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	Like at all
FOOD	[ noodles ]	The menu is extensive, though, and maybe I need to head back there to try more of it? They make a big claim that if you don't see it on their menu they'll find a way to make it, however that didn't hold true when I asked about Cantonese pan fried noodles
FOOD	[ O  ]	an item that seems near impossible to find in this town
FOOD	[ O  ]	Although the staff was friendly and the language was not a barrier for me as it was for others, the food I got was not very good
FOOD	[ General Tso's Chicken, heat, chicken, crab ]	After I ordered the General Tso's Chicken, the woman turned on the fryer and, without waiting for the oil to heat up, she put in the chicken and my crab rangoon
FOOD	[ crab ]	Therefore, when I ate the food it wasn't crispy as a good General Tso's/crab rangoon  should be
FOOD	[ chicken, heat ]	Another thing that I noticed was that the chicken that she put in the fryer was sitting on the counter in the heat
FOOD	[ O  ]	*note: she hadn't fried any in quite some time which is why she had to turn the fryer on
FOOD	[ O  ]	The person that said the food was too sweet was right
FOOD	[ O  ]	Even though the menu said *spicy for my meal, there was no "zip" at all
FOOD	[ O  ]	Take it for what it's worth, but I know I will be looking for another restaurant to get my take out from now on
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is great
FOOD	[ lo mein, pork ]	If you live on the east side do yourself a favor and get the happy family, lo mein, and fried pork wontons (wontons are a must!!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was a little thrown off when I first moved to the east side of Madison and drove past this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	It doesn't have much curb appeal but  I decided to go in to check it out anyways, the pictures inside were nice and the people are friendly and the lady even gave me free wontons since it was my first time, so it was a win win win!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Call ahead as they state on their website that they appreciate it if you do
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best take out Chinese in East Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food is always fresh and well cooked
FOOD	[ rice ]	 Sometimes you have to make sure they didn't forget the rice - mainly when the woman who typically works the front counter is not there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have always found the service to be friendly
FOOD	[ chicken, dumplings ]	 Periodically, I have  even received free chicken dumplings or a soda
FOOD	[ O  ]	 By far the best Moo Shu I have found in Madison after living here for 15 years and trying several of the more upscale places in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	FYI, there is a small seating area here but it is mainly a takeout place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best Chinese in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Yeah, I know, Madison is short on good Chinese
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, this place has good prices, decent food and great service
FOOD	[ O  ]	1 - Great customer service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I put that first because it is difficult to find at carry out places
FOOD	[ dumplings, appetizer ]	2 - I had the steamed dumplings as my appetizer
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Delicious! HOT (temperature)! and very satisfying
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They are large in size and 8 in an order for $5
FOOD	[ O  ]	99
FOOD	[ Chicken, Lo Mein, chicken, pork ]	3 - For our entree we ordered Chicken Lo Mein and Combo of General Tsao's chicken which came with a pork eggroll
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Everything was delicious and fresh
FOOD	[ Lo Mein, noodles ]	 The Lo Mein was hot and the noodles were perfectly cooked
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nothing was over done
FOOD	[ chicken, pork, fried rice ]	 The General's chicken came with pork fried rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You could tell everything was fresh
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 It had great flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Flaming Wok was not anything new, but it was good quality
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food was hot and delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was a fair price and the counter guy threw in some extra goodies
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not to mention, after a long Target trip, you can call and your food will be ready in 15 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Used to be a fabulously affordable restaurant with good food, too (and a nice vegetarian plate selection)
FOOD	[ menus ]	Then in they suddenly printed new, fancy menus (minus the vegetarian listing), jacked up the prices, and decorated the place up a little more
FOOD	[ O  ]	After that the food didn't taste as good and the service became lackluster -perhaps forgiveable if not for the price increases
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our little group of Laredo's fans was heartbroken
FOOD	[ O  ]	Never been upset with Loredo's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Resturant is always clean and service is always good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I prefer their new location in Fitchburg
FOOD	[ O  ]	I didn't think the meal was spectacular but it was fast
FOOD	[ salsa, chips ]	I love the salsa and chips they put out and the at atmosphere is casual/enjoyable
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think in the evening, it sounds like a fun place but we came for lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pretty good
FOOD	[ chips, burrito ]	Nice chips, good burrito
FOOD	[ mexican ]	Haven't found any Wonderful mexican in Madison so far, but this is not bad
FOOD	[ mexican ]	Very good mexican food
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Authentic in taste and atmosphere
FOOD	[ Fajita ]	 The Fajita Guadalajara is our favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We share it and there's plenty for both of us
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been to Laredo's three times now, and it just doesn't do it for me
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is fine, but nothing to write home about
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ pretty cheap
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ lots of combo platters so you can easily mix it up
FOOD	[ chips, salsa ]	- chips/salsa not that good
FOOD	[ O  ]	- food is only average
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tonight I ordered the chimichangas
FOOD	[ O  ]	Instead of one big one, you get two smaller ones
FOOD	[ choice, chicken, beef ]	Since you get two and your choice of chicken or beef, I asked for one of each
FOOD	[ beans ]	They brought my platter, and after I took a bite of beans I noticed our waitress hovering over me with another platter
FOOD	[ O  ]	She explained that "this one" had one of each, and that she was going to take the one they gave me and "just throw it away
FOOD	[ O  ]	" 
FOOD	[ O  ]	A waste, because it wasn't really that big of a deal if they'd brought me two of the same; there was no price difference and I wasn't dead set on having one of each
FOOD	[ chicken ]	As it turns out, I think they had originally given me what I asked for and took it away, because my replacement plate was two chicken chimis*
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food trashed for no reason, and potentially the correct order (or they plated it incorrectly, twice)
FOOD	[ meat ]	*Their idea of chimichangas are really just bigger-than-average flautas; they were open-ended and have no filling aside from the meat
FOOD	[ O  ]	They also offer flautas, I wonder if they're just the same thing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Other blips in service:
FOOD	[ soup ]	- served everyone but one person at the table, and took forever to finally bring them their food (soup)
FOOD	[ O  ]	- we had three kids with our group, and their parents explained they were going to split a meal between the three of them; the waitress didn't bring any extra plates, so we made "plates" out of napkins
FOOD	[ O  ]	So, yeah
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	The food there is fine, but the atmosphere (dark) and service (lacking) make it pretty low on my list of Mexican places in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	There really aren't  many places to eat in Madison as other reviews have stated
FOOD	[ O  ]	Being from NY it really did seem like a no mans land, so thankfully Yelp came to our rescue
FOOD	[ carne asada, nachos, chicken, chimichanga ]	We went to Laredo's and got carne asada, nachos with chicken, chimichanga's,and churros
FOOD	[ O  ]	It wasn't the greatest but it wasn't the worst thing in the world
FOOD	[ O  ]	We only got our food to take-out so I don't really know about there wait staff or the bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	We got our food pretty quickly and it was hot but not really well packaged
FOOD	[ O  ]	When we got back to the hotel some  of packages where leaking, it was annoying but didn't effect the taste
FOOD	[ O  ]	All the food was good and has something familiar about it
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	If your in Madison,WI and are looking for decent Mexican then try Laredo's
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	I think Laredo's has the best Mexican food in Madison
FOOD	[ salsa, guacamole ]	I really like their salsa and guacamole
FOOD	[ cheese, enchiladas ]	They have great cheese enchiladas too
FOOD	[ margaritas ]	Their margaritas are really tasty too:-) I recommend going to eat here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have to admit that I was a little bit surprised in that the food was actually pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm not sure why I was expecting otherwise
FOOD	[ cookie cutter, Mexican ]	 I guess because from the outside it just looks like your standard cookie cutter Mexican restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Hell maybe it is
FOOD	[ fajita, iron, skillet ]	I had a veggie fajita that came out, as it should, sizzling on a cast iron skillet
FOOD	[ beans, rice ]	 The veggies were well prepared and flavorful, as were the beans and rice that came with them
FOOD	[ horchata ]	The only complaint I have is with the horchata I drank
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It tasted OK, but it was too rich
FOOD	[ rice, milk, cow, milk ]	 Like they ran low on rice milk and supplemented with cow milk or something
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It also left a slight film in my mouth which is a quick way to get me to dislike anything
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's not the best or most authentic, but I love it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service is great and combo #1 is a home run
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is about the one near Hilldale
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Awful
FOOD	[ O  ]	No stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	I guess we should have taken our clues form the emptiness of the restaurant and the fact happy our lasted until closing
FOOD	[ peach, color ]	The margarita was a sickly peach color and was solid in the pitcher
FOOD	[ O  ]	The plates were served with the thumb of a dirty oven mitt in the food (I'm guessing they came out of the microwave)
FOOD	[ enchiladas, mole ]	The enchiladas were slimy and water-logged covered in a dilute, flavorless "mole" (i wouldn't call it that
FOOD	[ rice, salt, corn ]	The rice was instant and without any seasoning, not even salt,  with a couple bits of also favor less corn
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waiter did one of those disinterested "howseverythinggoingeverythingokay" before we flagged him back to say it was inedible
FOOD	[ margaritas ]	We declined his offer to make it again and just received a bill for the margaritas that we also left
FOOD	[ O  ]	On the way, when we commented on how gross the food looked as well as tasted, another dinner confirmed she would never go there again
FOOD	[ margaritas, enchiladas, Mole ]	So we went across the road to Pascals and had real margaritas and excellent enchiladas with Mole
FOOD	[ O  ]	Stay away!Ole? 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh no
FOOD	[ salsa ]	I can safely say I tried it, right? They have an extensive menu, reasonably priced lunch specials, and decent salsa, but that's about it
FOOD	[ Guacamole, chicken, fajitas ]	Guacamole that came with my chicken fajitas looked like someone had driven over it with a Mack truck and it didn't taste much better
FOOD	[ Chicken, flavor ]	Chicken was grisly and lacked flavor and the peppers were so over cooked they melted in my mouth
FOOD	[ melt ]	Not in that good melt-in-your-mouth sort of way
FOOD	[ O  ]	In my quest to find the best of the Mex in the Midwest, Laredo's didn't have it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Got a rec? 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Let me know
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	Basic Mexican fare
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food is inexpensive
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I am a regular
FOOD	[ O  ]	See more info in my review of Pedro's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food was excellent and our server was exceptional
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He was friendly, checked back with us often, and made sure we had a great meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I would go back for the food, but the server we had put it over the top for me
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	Some of the best Mexican food in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Well priced, great food, friendly service, and nice atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is where you go to get wrecked
FOOD	[ cheese ]	by cheese
FOOD	[ cheese, cheese ]	 If you like cheese A LOT, you can order any of their delicious combos smothered in ooey, gooey, creamy, warm cheese
FOOD	[ cheese ]	Is there actually any real food underneath the gigantic blobs of cheese?  Strap on a portable oxygen tank and dive in to find out!
FOOD	[ O  ]	In the 1988 film "The Blob," an evil life form goes around eating people, only at Laredo's you can finally get yer revenge and eat the blob
FOOD	[ O  ]	if you dare!  
FOOD	[ O  ]	*blurp *blurp*so, chinese food
FOOD	[ O  ]	i never care for it, but every once in a while, mr
FOOD	[ O  ]	bekee gets a hankerin', so i go along
FOOD	[ O  ]	their vegetable moo shu was excellent
FOOD	[ vegetables, egg, tortillas, plum sauce ]	a great mix of fresh, crispy (when necessary) vegetables and egg, delivered with four pancakes (not flour tortillas, like some places try to pull), and yummy plum sauce
FOOD	[ spring roll ]	the vegetable spring roll was also a success, though a little over-greasy
FOOD	[ meat, garlic, dumplings, pork, egg roll ]	my dining companion had a three-meat and garlic sauce dish, which he said was delicious with dumplings and a pork egg roll
FOOD	[ O  ]	all were very tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	the best part was that the delivery took under 15 minutes! and we're over 2 miles away, as the car drives
FOOD	[ O  ]	i presume they'll become part of our lazy weekend agenda
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was all right
FOOD	[ egg roll ]	 The vegetable egg roll was great
FOOD	[ fried rice ]	 The fried rice was ok
FOOD	[ chicken, lo mein, noodles, vegetables, meat ]	 I had chicken lo mein and the noodles & vegetables were good, but the meat was yuck
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm not sure what it is
FOOD	[ meat, meat ]	I think I should only order items that do NOT have meat in them when I go to restaurants, because I commonly end up unsatisfied with the meat and it ruins the whole meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The checken was bland, tasteless, kind of gummy and some pieces were extremely gristly
FOOD	[ fortune cookies, moo shu pork ]	The fortune cookies were the good kind :) and they gave my boyfriend real pancakes w/his order (moo shu pork I think?)  He seemed to like his quite a bit
FOOD	[ O  ]	PS it was delivery, not eat-in, and the delivery time wasn't horrible, but not super great
FOOD	[ O  ]	I ordered delivery from this place
FOOD	[ min ]	It took them about 40 min to deliver, which I think is a standard
FOOD	[ O  ]	Well, the food was alright - didn't wow me and my friend, but we didn't complain about it either
FOOD	[ O  ]	I liked the fact that they serve not overly greasy chinese
FOOD	[ pork, chop suey, beef, peas ]	We ordered pork chop suey, mixed vegetable, and beef with snow peas
FOOD	[ O  ]	All of them tasted  good without making my guts feel nauseous
FOOD	[ chow mein, noodle ]	One thing my friend and I didn't know - so in Midwest (or in Madison only?) "chow mein" is not a noodle dish 
FOOD	[ Lo mein, noodle ]	 So make sure to order "Lo mein" if you want that noodle dish
FOOD	[ Chow mein, chop suey ]	Chow mein is chop suey
FOOD	[ O  ]	I swear it's not like that in California!This is my go to place for Chinese delivery
FOOD	[ dumplings ]	Never actually been to the store though, most of the food is pretty standard, however the dumplings are fantastic, they're all I order now
FOOD	[ O  ]	No vegetarian options, and staff always too busy and not personable
FOOD	[ China ]	The great thing about China Wok is it is exactly what you'd expect
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's your decent, standard Americanized Chinese fare
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never had a bad experience; it's always the same
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is close by me, so delivery is always super fast
FOOD	[ dumplings ]	Although the food is generally nothing special, the fried dumplings hold an especially, soft, doughy spot in my heart
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is our "go-to" Chinese restaurant on the North and East side of Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's not going to knock your socks off or anything but it's by far the best in the area in this price range
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is not super greasy or full of crazy amounts of that fake testing Chinese food seasoning some of the restaurants put in (I don't know what it is
FOOD	[ O  ]	but there are some of you right now who know what I'm talking about!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are not overly helpful on the phone but in the many times we've ordered (over 6 years), they've never messed up on an order, are always within 30 minutes of a delivery time, and deliver HOT
FOOD	[ chicken, lo mein, tofu, tofu, cashew ]	We recommend the orange chicken, the vegetable lo mein, and any form of tofu--especially the tofu cashew (as a nice vegetarian option)
FOOD	[ tofu ]	I see that some people say there aren't veggie options but as a family that is primarily vegetarian, they've substituted tofu in every dish without complaint
FOOD	[ O  ]	And will make just about any dish you ask
FOOD	[ O  ]	They may not appear to be excited about doing it but then again, I don't think they get excited about anything
FOOD	[ O  ]	They just do what they do--Make good, fast, hot Chinese food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really, what more do you want?My go to delivery Chinese spot
FOOD	[ O  ]	from that category you gotta know what to expect but the Wok definitely steps it up over any other delivery place that I know of in the area
FOOD	[ O  ]	So far the best Chinese delivery we've had here in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their food is flavorful, fresh, and not super-greasy
FOOD	[ O  ]	They also have an online menu to order from, which is amazing! It makes life simple, and I don't have to worry that I mispronounce something or said the wrong thing entirely
FOOD	[ crab ]	The only complaint I had is that while our food was steamy hot, the crab rangoons weren't
FOOD	[ O  ]	They were actually a little on the cool side
FOOD	[ O  ]	But, it's delivery, so that's not all that surprising
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not too greasy, not too salty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Quick delivery
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fresh ingredients
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fast delivery
FOOD	[ O  ]	use the computer based ordering system
FOOD	[ O  ]	very efficient
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall very good food and experience
FOOD	[ China ]	You know how you see a picture of food at a restaurant, you order it, only to have what is put on your plate barely resemble what you saw in the picture?  Well, you don't have to worry about this at China Wok
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What you get as your meal looks even better than the pictures above their counter
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've dined at this carry out Chinese location numerous times over the past 2 years
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My office is only a mile or so away and it makes for a quick meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I must say, I feel like something has changed in the past year
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When I used to go, I felt like no matter what I ordered, it all looked/tasted the same
FOOD	[ color, vegetables ]	(ie sauce, color, vegetables, etc)  But for the past year or so, my coworker and I marvel at how great the food looks when it comes from the kitchen
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We primarily dine in
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We're practically giving each other high-fives, because we feel like we just scored big
FOOD	[ flavor ]	And the flavor is just as good as it looks
FOOD	[ China ]	 I just ate at another carryout Chinese location and the quality of food reminded me how great China Wok is, so I jumped out to right this review
FOOD	[ Chicken, Beef ]	I regularly get Kung Pao Chicken or Mongolian Beef
FOOD	[ General Tso's Chicken ]	 My coworker exclusively gets General Tso's Chicken (this thing always looks amazing!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value is always great
FOOD	[ egg roll ]	we can get both of our lunches, i usually add an egg roll (75 cents) and he usually gets a soda and it costs us around $12 for both of us
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Quantity of food is also great
FOOD	[ O  ]	As you can tell, I highly recommend this place
FOOD	[ China ]	 Given it's a carryout Chinese place, I really should give it 5 stars for overcoming such an obstacle!Like most Chinese in Madison (it seems) China Wok is pretty middle of the road
FOOD	[ O  ]	I won't say it's the worst I've had
FOOD	[ O  ]	that honor was given to Wong's on Atwood, but it's certainly not the best
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have 3 indicators for good Chinese food
FOOD	[ color ]	What color is the sweet and sour sauce? (It shouldn't be red
FOOD	[ noodles, noodles, noodles ]	How thick are the crispy noodles? (They shouldn't be, they're noodles, thick "noodles" are just fried wonton wrappers
FOOD	[ O  ]	What are their specialties
FOOD	[ O  ]	(If they all sound American, they're not special
FOOD	[ China, noodles ]	While China Wok has red sauce, thick noodles and specialties that I could probably make it's decent when you're in a bind, have nothing in the fridge and live 2 minutes away
FOOD	[ bucks ]	They also have a pretty large delivery radius, and it's only ten bucks minimum, so even if you're solo you can probably hit that mark
FOOD	[ O  ]	Extremely nice folks though, so for convenience and pleasurable peeps, I'd probably hit them up again
FOOD	[ O  ]	There food is good for what it is and the owners are great!! A few months back they let me in after hours to order
FOOD	[ O  ]	I need to give these guys another star solely based on the fact that I've been there 3 times this month
FOOD	[ O  ]	And while I hold my ground that it isn't he best in town, the staff is incredible
FOOD	[ O  ]	so sweet! And if you miss their crazy 5-$7 lunch specials 11-3, that's ok, because dinner specials start at $8 or so
FOOD	[ cook ]	Again, I've had better in town, but for fast, like lightening fast take-out, it's fit the bill on some colder nights when I didn't feel like leaving the couch to cook
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thanks for the Chinese Delivery suggestion, Yelp! I ordered online using the Beyond Menu app, which was simple enough
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious food
FOOD	[ Gai, Egg, Soup ]	I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan (see pic) and Egg Drop Soup
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delivery arrived on-time
FOOD	[ China ]	Will order delivery from here again!China Wok is my go-to delivery place for basic Chinese
FOOD	[ belly ]	When I just want some moderately priced food that will get here fast, fill my belly with warm and comforting Asiatic foodstuffs, this is who I turn to
FOOD	[ China ]	I can't speak for its authenticity or service, but I can speak for how often I find myself hungry, cold, and ordering from China Wok's online delivery system
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't generally care for Sweet & Sour anything
FOOD	[ gelatinous ]	That's not real food!  Have you seen that toxic-waste colored, gelatinous red sauce?  That can't be good for you
FOOD	[ China ]	 But on a friend's recommendation, I tried it from China Wok
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's delicious
FOOD	[ fried chicken, pork, fried rice ]	Somehow the battered and fried chicken had not become soggy during delivery, and I found it was insanely addictive over pork fried rice
FOOD	[ fried rice ]	(I like their fried rice- not too greasy
FOOD	[ heat ]	But it seems to turn bitter when you re-heat it the next day
FOOD	[ dumplings ]	Decent dumplings, and my BF seems to enjoy the spare ribs, since those are the only two things he ever orders from there
FOOD	[ dumplings ]	The sauce that comes with those dumplings is pretty awesome I must say
FOOD	[ crab, crab, meat ]	I also enjoy the crab rangoons, though they are the very creamy kind with almost no actual crab meat
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ask me if I care
FOOD	[ O  ]	Because I don't
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really, I've probably had 75% of the menu by now, and nothing really sticks out as "not good
FOOD	[ Teriyaki, Chicken ]	"  Though once we tried the Teriyaki Chicken and found it to be pretty dry
FOOD	[ O  ]	Who knows if that is how it usually is, since we only tried it once
FOOD	[ O  ]	What business did we have ordering Japanese food from a Chinese place anyway?
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are reliable, fairly priced, good size portions, hot when it arrives, completely non-threatening Chinese
FOOD	[ cuisine ]	If I wanted authentic Chinese cuisine, I'd be going somewhere for dine-in, not carry out
FOOD	[ China ]	 China Wok delivers, and makes my insides happy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good Chinese at an affordable price
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have the best lunch combos and the food is usually ready for pickup in 10 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	My food is always hot and have yet had any complaints with consistency
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not the best Chinese out there but for the price it's pretty solid!DISGUSTING !! I had lunch there yesterday
FOOD	[ O  ]	Half way through there was a hair in my sub
FOOD	[ O  ]	It looked like a pubic hair
FOOD	[ O  ]	I took up to the manager and he offered to make me a new one
FOOD	[ O  ]	Since he was the one who made it in the first place I respectfully declined
FOOD	[ O  ]	How about you guys where hair nets or beard nets
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will not go back to this place again
FOOD	[ grill ]	Great cousins!  The subs are always good and they have a grill!  If you want Cousins, GO TO THIS ONE!I know I shouldn't expect much from BK, but this location is ridiculous
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You really shouldn't even THINK of going here during lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have ONE cash register at the front of the store
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not just one OPEN register
FOOD	[ O  ]	 they only have one register, usually being operated by the slowest person they employ
FOOD	[ O  ]	The drive-through is no better
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Cars are backed up into the next parking lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you insist on trying to eat there, I would suggest you go inside to eat, that way, when they invariably get your order wrong, you can throw it directly at them
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	 If you get drive-through you will end up like me, paying for a double cheeseburger only to get back to your desk and find out that they totally screwed you and only gave you a single
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You will then slam your fists on your desk and start swearing and get called into your boss' office
FOOD	[ O  ]	 at least that's what happened with me
FOOD	[ O  ]	YMMVRANT:
FOOD	[ fast food ]	Madison, get more fast food
FOOD	[ fast food ]	I don't know how all these kids got through undergrad without a steady supply of fast food places
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My college town was saturated with them
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And it wasn't like an obesity epidemic had been unleashed in the student ghetto
FOOD	[ O  ]	I guess if you're a certain type, you'd think it's great that Madison forces kids to stay off the big mac meal plan
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I guess it probably is
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But it's certainly a hell of a lot less fucking fun
FOOD	[ age ]	 Responsibility comes on at an earlier age for badgers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's got to when the weather conspires to kill you 3/4ths of the year
FOOD	[ fast food ]	Had a drive for a fast food and decided to stop here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing more, nothing else
FOOD	[ O  ]	Whopper was good
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have a new soda machine - fun to play withThey recently remodeled and it looks really nice inside
FOOD	[ O  ]	They added TVs and all of there registers actually work now (yay!) They hired some new people as well which seems to really be helping this place out
FOOD	[ O  ]	it still takes forever to get your order  if there busy but at least it's only when there busy because before the new additions to the staff came along I use to go when it was almost completely dead and it would take 15 minutes for me to get my food, so I can tell that there trying but they still have a LONG ways to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great update to your facility, it needed it
FOOD	[ fries, sandwich ]	As I am used to only getting either my fries hot or my sandwich hot, generally neither at the same time
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was really dissatisfied that not one was hot enough to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	I physically left my whole meal and tray on the table and walked out
FOOD	[ ketchup ]	No amount of ketchup could make me eat it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hope they find a great staff so they can warrant spending the money on the upgrade
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will probably not go back to this location again
FOOD	[ fast food ]	This is the worst fast food franchise in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	The drive through is slow
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is inconsistent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The staff are ambivalent
FOOD	[ O  ]	Averaging over a minute per vehicle in the drive through isn't "fast"
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Serving burgers with mere samples of the veggies in the marketing material demonstrates poor attention to detail, if not inventory management problems
FOOD	[ fries, containers ]	They can't even consistently pack bags so that the fries stay in their containers
FOOD	[ containers, fries ]	 Why bother with the containers at all if the fries are just going to be scattered throughout the bag?
FOOD	[ O  ]	The franchises in Sun Prairie and De Forest remain "east side" options, but I'm giving up on this location
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Four chances in two years, and they never got it right
FOOD	[ O  ]	Worst BK I've ever been to
FOOD	[ fast food, fast food ]	That may not sound so serious considering its a fast food place but its terrible even by fast food standards
FOOD	[ O  ]	Orders take at least 10 minutes to complete and 25 percent of the time they come out wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't know how but their burgers are the worst, dry and tasteless
FOOD	[ apple ]	Aren't these food products supposed to be foolproof? I thought the renovation would've brought new employees and better service but this shiny apple is rotten inside
FOOD	[ O  ]	Never again
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thought I would stop at drive thru for quick lunch, twenty minute later with two cars in front of me waiting on there order i decided to leave
FOOD	[ O  ]	Felt bad for the cars in front of me that had already had paid for their food
FOOD	[ O  ]	When I left the car behind me followed as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I stopped here a couple of months ago and ordered inside and the wait was probabley just as long but they had money so I waited
FOOD	[ O  ]	I saw that they had remodeled and I hoped the found some new management and employees
FOOD	[ fast food ]	The concept of taking one order, then making that order before taking or starting another order is not the concept of the way a fast food restraunt should be run
FOOD	[ O  ]	Change the management and improve service, clean the inside and you might have a viable operation
FOOD	[ block ]	 The McDonalds down the block does not suffer from this poor management, just suffers from the McDonalds food
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	We have gone here in the past year four times and they are always out of ice cream
FOOD	[ O  ]	It doesn't matter the time of day
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	This last week we went to get ice cream and food
FOOD	[ chicken ]	Ordered chicken tenders they were out
FOOD	[ O  ]	OK can we have four cheeseburgers no we are out of buns
FOOD	[ O  ]	Well what can we get, whatever you want
FOOD	[ O  ]	We just left after all that
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not only the worst BK franchise I've ever been to
FOOD	[ O  ]	but probably the worst-managed restaurant franchise I've ever encountered
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a like a bad (bad) movie
FOOD	[ O  ]	OPEN ON two guys and a girl in a GREEN SOUL ordering drive through from Burger King on East Wash
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are hungry, but their order is easy
FOOD	[ fries ]	Just three burgers, twp fries, and one drink
FOOD	[ O  ]	AUDIO OVER (BK INTERCOM VOICE, with a bored lackluster air): "Okay, drive up to the window
FOOD	[ O  ]	The CAR pulls up behind two other cars waiting for their orders
FOOD	[ O  ]	And they wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	And wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	And wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	Six minutes later, the first car finally gets their food and drives off
FOOD	[ O  ]	The CARS pull up closer
FOOD	[ O  ]	And they wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	And wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	And wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	A few minutes later, two uniformed BURGER KING EMPLOYEES, one man and one woman, exit the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	They hang out in by the waiting CARS in front of the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Chatting for a few minutes, then amble back into the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	The CARS continue to wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	Minutes more pass
FOOD	[ O  ]	Two more BURGER KIND EMPLOYEES, two women, exit the store with a TODDLER in tow, but they are carrying huge bags of BK food
FOOD	[ O  ]	The DRIVER of the GREEN SOUL, "This is ridiculous, we've been waiting over 10 minutes, I'm getting out of here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Mickey D's is right over there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hey, are those BK employees carrying out FOOD?!"
FOOD	[ body, block ]	BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1, puts up her arm carrying a huge bag of TAKEOUT and uses her body to physically block the GREEN SOUL from leaving
FOOD	[ O  ]	The TODDLER wanders aimlessly and dangerously around the parking lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	The CAR in front of the GREEN SOUL receives their order finally, and drives off
FOOD	[ O  ]	The CAR waiting for food behind the SOUL peels out of line, barely missing the wandering TODDLER
FOOD	[ O  ]	BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting at the CASHIER through the window): "How long have these nice people been waiting?! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	CASHIER (searching for the order ticket): "Um
FOOD	[ O  ]	15 minutes
FOOD	[ ice ]	BK EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting): "Well, give them two free ice creams for making them wait so long!"
FOOD	[ O  ]	SOUL PASSENGER #1 (quietly): "It's okay, we just want the food we ordered
FOOD	[ O  ]	And, besides, there are three of us
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not two
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	BK EMPLOYEE (angrily shouting through the cashier window): "Just get them some ice cream
FOOD	[ O  ]	they were almost going to leave, you guys are so slow
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lucky I stopped them
FOOD	[ O  ]	You're the manager
FOOD	[ O  ]	Manage!"
FOOD	[ O  ]	A few more minutes pass
FOOD	[ ICE CREAM ]	One single ICE CREAM is passed through the window to the waiting passengers
FOOD	[ fries ]	Then, finally, a BAG with the burgers and fries arrives
FOOD	[ O  ]	The GREEN SOUL drives off down East Wash
FOOD	[ O  ]	Watching carefully to be sure the wandering TODDLER isn't in the way
FOOD	[ O  ]	SOUL PASSENGER takes a bite out of his burger, and spits it out into a napkin: "Oh my god! How in the hell did they ruin a Whopper, for chrissakes!? 
FOOD	[ O  ]	SOUL DRIVER: What's wrong with it?
FOOD	[ O  ]	SOUL PASSENGER #1: "It's cold
FOOD	[ O  ]	And I mean cold
FOOD	[ meat ]	It doesn't taste like meat
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's just rubbery and tasteless
FOOD	[ char, cheese ]	and where's the char-broiled taste? Did they forget to add it? The cheese is in no way melted
FOOD	[ mass, lettuce ]	There's a wilted mass of white lettuce core shoved in the middle, like a bad surprise
FOOD	[ bun ]	The bun crusty and stale
FOOD	[ O  ]	do I need to go on--?
FOOD	[ fries ]	SOUL PASSENGER #2, sampling a french fry: "And my fries are soggy and cold, too
FOOD	[ ketchup ]	and no ketchup packets in the bag
FOOD	[ bun ]	And my bun's stale, too!"
FOOD	[ O  ]	SOUL DRIVER starts to laugh: "that was so bad, I expected cameras to come out of the door next, 'smile, you're on candid camera!"
FOOD	[ O  ]	SOUL PASSENGER #1: "Or 'Punked
FOOD	[ O  ]	SOUL PASSENGER #2: "We were punked, all right
FOOD	[ ditch ]	Let's ditch this sorry excuse for food and order Culver's
FOOD	[ O  ]	the food is always hot and delicious there
FOOD	[ O  ]	And the staff is nice and helpful, too
FOOD	[ O  ]	The GREEN SOUL exits East Wash, and on the way into CULVER'S, PASSENGER #1 exits the vehicle, and throws the BK bags of food away in the CULVER'S garbage can
FOOD	[ O  ]	SOUL PASSENGER #2 getting back into the car: "Never again
FOOD	[ O  ]	SOUL PASSENGER #1 and SOUL DRIVER: "Never again!"
FOOD	[ O  ]	THE END
FOOD	[ O  ]	Well
FOOD	[ O  ]	this is definitely Jimmy Buffett in a nutshell
FOOD	[ O  ]	over the top wacky and colorful
FOOD	[ O  ]	a real escape from reality
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	kind of a wait, but they were really busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Throughout the meal we were serenaded with Buffett favorites by a guy on guitar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Worth eating there once, but a little too kitschy to appeal to me on a regular basis
FOOD	[ O  ]	3 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ate there once, and short of being annoyed by all the silly, wannabe island retreat crap, the food was average, overpriced, and it was the middle of Wisconsin winter, so who wants to be reminded that it's 3 freaking degrees outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Actually, the biggest problem I had with this place was the extravagant price for the bland food
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	 Much better burgers and sandwiches in Madison for a much more reasonable price
FOOD	[ Buffet, all good ]	Cheesy and totally overrated - the carribean fare in a Jimmy Buffet inspired setting is all good in theory, but the colorful interiors and catchy tunes are little compensation when you spend most of your time keeping flies away from your crappy food and balancing the BAD shaka-ritas (margarita flights) on creaky wooden tables in the patio
FOOD	[ crab, cake, fries ]	The food was uniformly ordinary - my vegetarian baja burger was way too spicy to be enjoyable, the crab-cake burger was a disaster and I left my fries practically untouched, which hardly ever happens! Overall, one of the worst restaurant experiences for me
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grade: F
FOOD	[ O  ]	A complete nightmare
FOOD	[ O  ]	Awful food served by stupid staff
FOOD	[ cheeseburger, appetizers ]	Can I get another helping of second-hand smoke with those stupid mini cheeseburger appetizers?Overrated, yes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fun, yes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Something different in a very Midwestern town, yes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 For that reason alone I give it 4 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Take a look at the options while in Middleton, there isn't much
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	 This is a great place to get drunk and eat a cheeseburger
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That's about it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However if that is what you want to do, come here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have an outdoor patio that is nice in the evening and on days that aren't too humid
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The place is loud and great for families
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The place is not good for an intimate setting, for that go to Lousianne's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Back to the thing about the drinks, the drink list is enourmous
FOOD	[ beer, liquor ]	 They have frozen drinks, on the rocks drinks, beer, liquor, you name they have it
FOOD	[ O  ]	   For those not from the midwest, it is a nice oasis
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'll leave it at that
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing spectacular
FOOD	[ crab ]	 The crab cakes were ok, could have been better but then they could have been much worse
FOOD	[ wine ]	 I decided to venture out of my comfort zone (meaning not drinking wine) and had one of their specialty drinks 
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	Cheeseburger in Paradise (from the web menu "An island sized, award winning signature drink that will change your attitude
FOOD	[ Bay, Rum, Pia, Rum, Strawberry, Daiquiri, fruit, juice, Blue Curacao ]	Layered with Parrot Bay Rum Pia Colada, Myers's Rum Runner, Margaritaville Margarita and Strawberry Daiquiri, each frozen layer is prepared from scratch with fresh fruit and juice, and surrounded by an ocean of Hiram Walker Blue Curacao
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	Garnished with the Hemisphere Dancer ("HD") and your own personal Cheeseburger In Paradise
FOOD	[ O  ]	")  Not as huge as it sounds (thankfully) and surprisingly very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ O  ]	As for music, they played the occasional Buffett song and at 7:30PM tonight, there was live music
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	I had started my evening looking for a local eatery, but after driving almost 40 miles (back and forth) to get cheese curds (more on that in my next reviews) I choose the first place that looked remotely interesting
FOOD	[ O  ]	As a lifelong Parrothead, I was expecting more out of this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was nothing inherently bad about it, but it's kind of a PJ McWhiskers with tiki torches
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've spent my share of time at Margaritaville in Key West and was expecting something closer to that, I guess
FOOD	[ appetizers, chips ]	My wife and I grabbed a few late nite appetizers (mini cheeseburgers and chips and queso) and both were fine
FOOD	[ beer ]	Nice beer selection featuring many Wisconsin labels
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife got the overpriced blended margarita which was tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	I do have to give them points for the bartender who was working his tail off as the only one behind the packed kidney-shaped bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	Someone who I can only assume was the manager on duty didn't make any moves to pitch in help the poor guy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm giving this place 3 stars for the bartender's effort and the decent food
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd go back if I was passing by, but wouldn't make a special effort to hit it up again
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	I had gone to a Cheeseburger in Paradise a few years ago in suburban IL
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I spent the evening gazing in horror, there was live music, and drunken gyrating soccer moms for MILES
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger, rush ]	(or what seemed like miles)  However, Cheeseburger in Paradise during dinner rush on a Thursday eve in MADISON
FOOD	[ O  ]	was a different more chill experience
FOOD	[ Buffet ]	 Jimmy Buffet was playing constantly over the sound system and our service was quick and friendly like any chain restaurant
FOOD	[ margaritas ]	The margaritas were OVERPRICED ($5
FOOD	[ lime ]	75 for a 16 oz plain lime margarita on the rocks), and the food was okay
FOOD	[ fish, sandwich ]	I had the blackened fish sandwich which was great
FOOD	[ sweet potato, chips ]	my sweet potato chips were not fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	(Pescetarians and vegetarian have LOTS of options here, which is at times uncommon for Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	)Staff was friendly and service was fairly prompt
FOOD	[ beer ]	The food was merely average and the "specially brewed" beer was weak
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, the place tries too hard with its theme
FOOD	[ O  ]	The weather was not cooperating, but they still had the doors wide open
FOOD	[ O  ]	This would have been a better day to leave the doors down and keep the diners inside
FOOD	[ O  ]	The county was under a tornado watch at the time and there were several severe storms in the vicinity
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not a day to encourage diners to eat on the patio
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger, beef ]	So, when I first heard of Cheeseburger in Paradise, my reaction was "oh no, that's totally lame, I'll never go there to eat beef among tiki torches
FOOD	[ Gluten, gluten, fries ]	"  Then I learned from my Gluten Free Restaurant Guide by Triumph Dining that they have a gluten-free menu, and then we were nearby when my father announced that he was hungry for a burger and fries
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	 And that's how we ended up at Cheeseburger in Paradise
FOOD	[ bun, gluten, french fries, fries ]	We enjoyed our bun-less burgers and gluten-free french fries (fried in a dedicated wheat-free fryer, unlike at most every other place that fries things) on the patio and were waited on by a conscientious and attentive server, Miles
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was clean, colorful, and goofy and they fed me safely
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is like an Islands chain wannabe, which happens to be a Jimmy Buffett-owned chain restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I went there with a friend and business partner I have known for years
FOOD	[ O  ]	The non-alcoholic "tropical" drink selection had a variety of maybe 10 drinks and they all sounded good
FOOD	[ Pineapple, coconut, pomegranate, grenadine ]	 I had an "Island Paradise" - Pineapple and coconut complemented with pomegranate grenadine and a splash of Sprite
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was very good
FOOD	[ appetizer ]	We ordered a quesadilla appetizer and it was pretty tasty
FOOD	[ chicken, cheese, vegetables, tortillas ]	 There was plenty of chicken, cheese, and vegetables between the tortillas and the portion was just right for us
FOOD	[ O  ]	We decided that we would both order something different so that we could share and try other foods on the menu
FOOD	[ Cubano, Cuban sandwich, ham, cheese, pork, pickle, mustard, bread ]	I ordered the "El Cubano" a traditional Cuban sandwich, made with ham, cheese, roasted pork, pickle and mustard all pressed inside two slices of Cuban bread
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was average at best
FOOD	[ BBQ, Cheddar ]	 My friend ordered the BBQ Cheddar Burger and it was excellent
FOOD	[ bun, beef, patty, BBQ, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions ]	 The burger is just as it sounds, consisting of a bun, beef patty, BBQ sauce cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, with fried onions
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 He gave me half and it was a lot better than the sandwich I ordered
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I did not even finish my half of the Cuban
FOOD	[ sandwich, sweet potato, chips ]	 My sandwich did come with sweet potato chips which were pretty good
FOOD	[ sweet potato, chips ]	 I am not usually a fan of sweet potato but found myself munching on these chips
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't know much about Jimmy Buffett, but the name of this place is actually the title of one of his songs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There are 38 locations in 17 states, all in places very far from Hawaii
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Maybe it isn't supposed to be like Hawaii, but I feel like it looks like what Hawaii might be envisioned by someone who has never been
FOOD	[ pineapple, teriyaki ]	 There was no version of the burger made with pineapple slices and teriyaki sauce
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	but maybe that's because Buffett supposedly wrote "Cheeseburger in Paradise" in the Carribbean
FOOD	[ O  ]	which changes everything
FOOD	[ Cubano ]	 Maybe that's why they serve the Cubano, which was still subpar at best
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, the food was satisfactory
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	 If I am ever in town again or happen to pass by a Cheeseburger in Paradise, I might go back because the drinks are good and the burgers are yummy
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	 It is a decent meal that won't break your wallet, but take a hint by the restaurant's name and order a cheeseburger
FOOD	[ O  ]	 WWJBD
FOOD	[ O  ]	what would Jimmy Buffett do?  Probably order a Cheeserburger in Paradise, and so should you
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love the wraps here and the drinks are prime! Food is decently priced and the drinks are a bit more pricey, but they taste excellent and get you more tipsy than you'd think :) I enjoy the whole island vibe of the place especially in the summer when you can sit outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have some live music at times as well and the wait staff has always been super friendly to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	I got so sick and was throwing up after eating there! I have never been back since
FOOD	[ O  ]	And normally I never get sick to my stomach
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't trust their food
FOOD	[ O  ]	And it is so overprized and overrated
FOOD	[ O  ]	No, No, Never, Never, Uh Uh Uh!!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sorry to say, this place is a disaster
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not because the decor is cheesy, but because they are mind numbingly slow, and the food is uber-forgettable
FOOD	[ O  ]	We called ahead and found that we could get a table for 16 on the patio, but when we got there at our appointed time nothing was ready - bad first impression
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were sat at four different tables near each other and moved the tables ourselves to create a configuration where our group could talk
FOOD	[ glasses ]	The waitress asked a couple times if anyone needed anything, but great service starts with keeping water glasses full, so if you see an empty one - FILL IT! That is decent restaurant skills 101 and costs you a star every time
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was cold, overcooked, tasteless and a little scary
FOOD	[ O  ]	I got a spicy burger and it was bland
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only way I would eat at this chain again would be if I washed up on a beach after being marooned for a week and they were giving the food away FREE
FOOD	[ O  ]	During a business trip in Madison, we scoped out some places to do dinner afterwards
FOOD	[ menus, Sangria ]	After browsing a few online menus and seeing that this place had pitchers of Sangria, we decided to give it a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	The experience here was pretty middle-of-the-road
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was a weeknight, and not very crowded, so we had no problem getting seated right away
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	While the decor and the environment is a bit much to stomach, I honestly enjoyed my cheeseburger and drinks
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	I would not go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the area and felt like a cheeseburger, this place would be on the list
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I could give NO stars this would be the place that deserves it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We were in on a Thursday night at around 7pm
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There were a handful of patrons(certainly more staff than paying customers)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There was one bartender who was bothered to make drinks
FOOD	[ glass, lime, mint ]	 We watched him make a moijto and when he poured from the shaker to the glass he spilled some over including a lime and some mint that went onto the bar, he picked them up and put them back into the cup
FOOD	[ keg ]	 DISGUSTING! Then the 4 of us at the bar were ready to order another round and the bartender went MIA, we waved down 2 waitresses who went into the back and we never saw them again, 10 minutes later he came back and when asked "what happened to you", he responded, "I am busy, I need to clean the keg lines
FOOD	[ O  ]	" 
FOOD	[ alcohol, sandwich, appetizer ]	Don't waste you time here!The name of this place is deceiving! This is a really great (including tropical cocktails and non-alcohol) Caribbean sandwich, burger and appetizer place
FOOD	[ chicken, gumbo ]	Great variety of tastes and the caribbean chicken gumbo is excellent!
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Substitutes? No problem mon
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's a lot of negative reviews on here, and I was hesitant to go tonight, but after hearing a co-worker say "they have the best wings i've ever had" I just had to go
FOOD	[ chicken ]	 Let's just say its hard for me to turn down good chicken wings
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our party of four included two toddlers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They got the mini cheeseburgers, which were average but good enough for kids to eat
FOOD	[ sauces ]	 We started with 18 wings split into three different sauces
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very tasty wings
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nice crunch to them
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We tended towards the sweet/spicy flavors and they all did not dissapoint
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They were better than BWW, and better than most chain American restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	 On a scale of 1-10 I'd give them a 9
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My wife said "wow, they are pretty darn good wings
FOOD	[ Sandwhich ]	My entree was less than stellar, I ordered the Cuban Sandwhich
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Having lived in South Florida for years this was definitely not on par with them, but wasn't a bad rendition
FOOD	[ O  ]	 About average
FOOD	[ Cajun, spice ]	My wife ordered the Cajun burger, which she said had no spice to it but it was still a decent burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, this place was better than I thought, nothing spectacular, but we'd definitely go back
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Its relatively inexpensive (most entrees 8-10$), service was good, and the drink menu looked great
FOOD	[ beer ]	 They had this cool 4' tower of beer that looked kind of fun to drink from
FOOD	[ O  ]	Amazing place! Love it here! What's with the bad reviews? Are you kidding me? 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best burgers in the Madison area, hands down
FOOD	[ fruity ]	Perfect fruity drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great service!  
FOOD	[ O  ]	bottom line: awesome!Nice atmosphere
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	Cheeseburger was not all that
FOOD	[ O  ]	I came here and ordered the baja burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was DISGUSTING
FOOD	[ vegetables, juice ]	Greasy, with wilted vegetables and absolutely dripping with excess juice
FOOD	[ O  ]	I could barely eat it, but I was so hungry that I just held my nose and forced down a few bites
FOOD	[ sweet potato, chips ]	The sweet potato chips weren't much better; too greasy and stale
FOOD	[ strawberry, daiquiri ]	My friend had a strawberry daiquiri, which I also tried
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was acceptable, but the taste was off
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service wasn't good either
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our waiter neglected us, and we did not feel at all taken care of
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will not be back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fun atmosphere and good for a round of drinks
FOOD	[ shrimp, tacos, rice ]	The food is okay--had the shrimp tacos which were tasty but the rice on the side was bland, dry and obviously made in bulk
FOOD	[ O  ]	I ate at the bar, the female bartender was far more concerned with a handful of male regulars and talking about how she could not wait to go get drunk
FOOD	[ O  ]	The other bartender was overheard complaining about his work hours- staff definitely brought down the fun atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	Never eating here again
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was sick for 2 days after I eat one of their burgers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Paradise?!  Absolutely not!   This place is a joke
FOOD	[ O  ]	  We've gone here a few times and each time confirms the bad experience preceding
FOOD	[ O  ]	  This place just does not serve up what their name implies
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	When I go to a place called Cheeseburger in Paradise I expect something above and beyond the regular burger down the street
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Instead, all they serve up here is hamburgers with fancy names
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Every burger I have ever ordered here has been lesser than any burger at any  greasy spoon or family restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ steak, fries, fries ]	I was hoping they would have some steak fries instead of the usual basic fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nope
FOOD	[ O  ]	  The burgers are just that, basic burgers with a sauce to match the fancy name
FOOD	[ chef, recipes, chef ]	  What chef dreamed up these recipes?   I doubt it was a chef
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Probably some person that said, "good enough, let's go make some money"
FOOD	[ bucks, bucks ]	Our burgers yesterday were about 10 bucks each and just basic burgers that should have cost about 4 bucks
FOOD	[ meat, flavor, sandwich, bun ]	  The meat didn't have any distinctive flavor and was rather skimpy, the sauce was not complimentary to the sandwich and the bun was generally regular too
FOOD	[ bun ]	  At least the bun was fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would only recommend this place to my Republican friends because they have no ability to think for themselves anyway and might actually like the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're looking for paradise you won't find it here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Last best burger I had was at Great Dane, maybe try there
FOOD	[ O  ]	  But I have had lame burgers there too
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Let me think, ummm,  
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are still reading
FOOD	[ O  ]	DON'T GO HERE
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Look elsewhere
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have avoided this place since it opened, but a friend insisted we meet up there for dinner
FOOD	[ fork ]	 First thing I noticed was the dirty fork in my silverware set
FOOD	[ chunk ]	 It had definitely gone through a dishwasher, which baked on a nice chunk of food from the previous user
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Pointed it out to the waiter who just swapped out my silverware set with some from a nearby table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 After that, I needed a drink
FOOD	[ Lime ]	 Ordered a Bud Light Lime since there was a huge banner that said $2
FOOD	[ O  ]	50 for that brand all during May
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nope, they were out and the waiter said we could NOT substitute for another drink (i
FOOD	[ O  ]	a Corona or something similar)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Ok then, I'll just order a $9
FOOD	[ mushroom ]	39 mushroom and swiss
FOOD	[ fries ]	 Food came and the fries were cold
FOOD	[ fries ]	 Told the waiter we wanted new fries and he obliged
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The burger was nothing special
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Should have been half the price we paid
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Then, after I'm half way done with the burger, the waiter returns and says he checked with the manager and we could get a Corona for $2
FOOD	[ O  ]	50
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Too late
FOOD	[ O  ]	 By this time, I just wanted to leave
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The place was not busy at all, I'm not sure what took him so long to check with the manager about that
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I hate these theme restaurants and this trip just served to solidify my beliefs that gimmicky restaurants usually do not have good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'll stick with 5 Guys or Nitty Gritty when I want a good burger
FOOD	[ beat ]	 Hell, just go next door to TGIFridays, even they beat this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	What you're really doing is playing for the experience
FOOD	[ crab ]	I had the mini crab burgers and they were pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	The drinks are good, but overpriced
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was mediocre
FOOD	[ O  ]	OK, I must start by saying that the kids wanted to go here and I was not that excited about it
FOOD	[ beer ]	  However, I was surprised by the reasonable beer selection and the nice menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food came out very slow, slooow, sloooooow
FOOD	[ O  ]	the burgers were pretty good
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	The big problem with Cheeseburger was the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We thought our waiter had a job at a restaurant across town!  He would disappear for long periods of time (could not see him anywhere in the restaurant) and then reappear maybe 15-20 minutes later
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Order food, where did he go? Order a drink, where did he go?  Finish eating, wait 15 minutes for the check
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Try to pay the check, he wanders off for another 15 minutes with the credit card
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not going back, even though the food was fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	Greasy food, lazy service, flat soda
FOOD	[ patty, fries ]	 For a place the is supposed to specialize in burgers they sucked!  The patty was dry and over cooked everything was greasy, and the only thing that was ok were the fries but that is not a reason to go
FOOD	[ fries ]	Service and fries are  where they excel
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We have been there 5 or 6 times and that's what stands out
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I like their burgers but the rest of the menu items are not too good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not a place I am compelled to visit often
FOOD	[ O  ]	Been there twice now and have had mixed results
FOOD	[ O  ]	First time there the service was fast, which is nice because I only have a 50 minute lunch break, and the food was OK
FOOD	[ Guacamole, Bacon ]	I got the Guacamole Bacon burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was tasty but the burger itself was overly greasy
FOOD	[ O  ]	The toppings were very good though so that saved the burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	Second time there had the bigger issues
FOOD	[ O  ]	Again we're on a shorter lunch and usually they accommodate well
FOOD	[ O  ]	We didn't have anybody come to our table for drink orders for over 10 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	2 tables came in after us and got drinks and ordered food before us
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was a little annoying considering the place wasn't that busy when we sat down
FOOD	[ O  ]	Again the good was OK
FOOD	[ Chicken, sandwich, bun ]	This time I had the Sweet Fire Chicken sandwich and it was better tasting than the burger I had but still was very greasy and the bun was mush by the end
FOOD	[ O  ]	Am willing to try it again and see how it goes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Will update review thenI went here with my girlfriend about a month ago
FOOD	[ guacamole ]	I got the black & blu burger and she got the guacamole burger
FOOD	[ bun ]	I thought my burger was greasy, as I was eating it the bun started to fall apart
FOOD	[ O  ]	the service was ok, I've had better though
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had an OK experience but I won't be back
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have been here multiple times and have usually had great experiences, but last night was awful
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	 We made reservations as they had a promotion for National Cheeseburger Day and there were six of us
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When my friend and I got there, we told the hostess that we were meeting friends and had a reservation under another friend's name, and she shrugged at us three times before asking us how many were in our party and never bothered to find our reservation
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We told her we had an infant with us, and she looked annoyed to have to accommodate a baby
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She eventually asked us if we wanted to wait for the others in our party or sit down, and then walked us to our table and told us nothing about who our server was or ever cracked a smile
FOOD	[ O  ]	We sat for at least 10 minutes with no service and eventually flagged down a waiter, who found our server, who arrived about 5 minutes later
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The drink service was incredibly slow, and the food service was okay
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our burgers were average, which was disappointing since we've come there often and enjoyed the burgers
FOOD	[ meat ]	 It seems their buns and meat have changed and the quality is not as good as it had been
FOOD	[ O  ]	A disappointing trip, and we likely won't be back anytime soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	Generic chain food, most of which is made from frozen out of a bag ingredients
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Don't waste your money or time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 TGI Friday's or Applebee's with a Caribbean theme
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was wary about going here but now I know not to ever go again
FOOD	[ food poisoning ]	The atmosphere was fun, our waitress was good, but I gave it one star because I got food poisoning from this place
FOOD	[ fish and chips ]	I ordered the fish and chips and was very sick (stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, bloating, gas) that night until the next couple days
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was horrible
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	I know it was from the food at Cheeseburger in Paradise
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will never go there again! I don't want others to get sick so that is why I am posting this negative review
FOOD	[ O  ]	If this is paradise, I'll stick with the mediocre lifestyle I live from day to day
FOOD	[ O  ]	Awful, sums up my first impression of the place
FOOD	[ Buffet ]	 I was greeted by a revolving door that looked like the windows hadn't been cleaned since the last time Jimmy Buffet was in town
FOOD	[ liquid ]	 We were seated at our booth, but before I could slide on in I asked if they would wipe the liquid off of the seat
FOOD	[ liquid ]	 I went to the bathroom and washed my hands (the bathroom is another story) When I came back, the liquid was still on the seat of the booth
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waitress just sluffed off the fact i was agitated by the lack of customer service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Seriously
FOOD	[ O  ]	 How hard is it to wipe off the booth
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nothing great, but ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Portions are weak however
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You'll probably have to venture across the lot to McDonalds for a Big Mac afterward if you want to be full
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A Big Mac would probably be as flavorful as the burgers served here
FOOD	[ O  ]	What irked me about my trip here was the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 First was the lack of caring when it came to the booth's cleanliness
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Second, I never got a refill on my soda
FOOD	[ O  ]	 For $2
FOOD	[ glass ]	49, I'm sure jimmy could afford another glass of soda
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It took our waitress nearly 10 minutes to collect come back with our bill
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was like they took my debit card and walked to my bank instead of swiping it to collect payment
FOOD	[ O  ]	They get two stars because I didn't have to choke down the food
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger ]	 However I think I'd rather get in my old car, drive to McDonalds, and risk the chance I get explosive diarrhea before climbing into a sailboat and pointing it toward Cheeseburger In Paradise
FOOD	[ fishes, seafood, chicken ]	Decent restaurant with plenty of fishes, seafood and chicken on menu
FOOD	[ pork, beef ]	I dont eat pork or beef
FOOD	[ O  ]	Loved it
FOOD	[ icing, cake ]	I have always loved this place BUT the last 3 times I have visited I have had TERRIBLE service and last night was the icing on the cake!!!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Last night (Thursday) we arrived at 10:20 pm for a late dinner after a show
FOOD	[ O  ]	Since they were supposed to close at 11:00 pm we figured it was enough time to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	When we walked in there were only three other tables of people, one of which was a couple that came in right before us
FOOD	[ O  ]	We waited at the host stand for 3 minutes and finally were greeted by the bartender
FOOD	[ O  ]	He took us to our table and told us our waitress would be with us shortly
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only server left (female, dark brown hair) came over and rushed her greeting by acting annoyed that we were there
FOOD	[ O  ]	She took our order and ran off to start doing the close prep
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 minutes later she came back to our table and said that the bar was closing (10:30 pm) and that we couldn't get frozen drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	She asked if we were interested in ordering another type of drink but we declined
FOOD	[ O  ]	She then acted annoyed that we didn't want something other than water! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our food quickly came out and it was WONDERFUL (thankfully) but our waitress never came back to check on us
FOOD	[ glass ]	I ran out of water and just as I was putting my napkin down she came over with another glass
FOOD	[ O  ]	At that time we asked for our check
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were so mad about the quality of the service that we just wanted to get out of there
FOOD	[ O  ]	We ended up walking out the door at 11:00 pm on the dot! 
FOOD	[ min ]	My partner and I always tip a min of 20% but often if we like someone we will tip way above
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our service was so terrible that we left her a 15% tip with a note explaining how uncomfortable she made our visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	If she had one ounce of sweetness to her we would've given her 20% BUT she was cold and distant
FOOD	[ O  ]	I understand wanting to get off of work but at least fake a smile and a personality
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will not be coming back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes, the food was amazing BUT bad service equals a no go in my book
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, why close the bar 30 minutes early???? The drinks are around $8 so do the math on how much you are losing if our table would've ordered 2-4 drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm just beyond put off
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grade: C
FOOD	[ O  ]	Decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing offensive but nothing memorable either
FOOD	[ O  ]	Average Italian menu items and good service in a nice setting
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Try the steaks they are very good for the price
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Staff is also very good with children
FOOD	[ O  ]	We went here on a Friday night so it was extremely busy, which is to be expected
FOOD	[ O  ]	However management obviously didn't plan staffing well because the waitresses were in a frenzy trying to keep up
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our particular waitress was clearly unnerved and looked miserable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It wasn't hard to see that she didn't want to make small talk, she just wanted you to hurry up and order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So we did
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It took a really long time for the food to come up
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We waited at least 45 minutes for our main entrees
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food was just ok, and our waitress messed up my dining companion's order and when we asked about it she was like, "oh sorry!" as she dashed away and that was the end of that
FOOD	[ O  ]	So the food was average, not great
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was rushed and unfriendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not worth the price
FOOD	[ O  ]	disappointing
FOOD	[ all good ]	server was nice and pretty attentive but that's about all good i can say about this place
FOOD	[ appetizer, mozzarella ]	we ordered an appetizer of mozzarella sticks that were pretty decent but nothing to rave over
FOOD	[ tomato, basil, soup ]	 while we were still eating them, our tomato basil soup arrived so i had to juggle which one i wanted to eat before they got cold
FOOD	[ soup, choice ]	 it turns out, i didn't much care for the soup so that was an easy choice
FOOD	[ appetizer, soup ]	mid-way through the appetizer/soup course, viola!  our main course arrived
FOOD	[ O  ]	 i admit, it's a pet peeve of mine to get food before i'm ready for it
FOOD	[ O  ]	so that's a big part of why this restaurant is not my favorite
FOOD	[ dishes ]	however, the dishes we got weren't particularly good either
FOOD	[ spinach, chicken, ravioli, marinara ]	i got the spinach chicken ravioli with marinara on three and alfredo on the other three
FOOD	[ chicken ]	 the chicken didn't seem quality and it was stuck in the raviolis in chunks and it distracted from the consistency of it as a dish
FOOD	[ steak ]	my beau's steak was inedible
FOOD	[ O  ]	 his first bite was gristle -- so much so that he had to spit it back out
FOOD	[ steak ]	 he only managed to gnaw through half the steak 
FOOD	[ O  ]	and i think he did that only because he was so hungry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 he asked for it medium-rare and it came so rare that, if it was me, i would have definitely sent it back to be cooked more
FOOD	[ O  ]	overally, i was just disappointed by benvenuto's
FOOD	[ O  ]	bummer
FOOD	[ O  ]	Gave it four stars last time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food and service has gone down hill since then
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The specials are absolutely atrocious and old standbys we used to like are lower quality
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Skip this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	OK
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is not a 5-star place
FOOD	[ date ]	 But I had to give the 5 stars in order to offset the ratings to date
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I went there because the Isthmus Annual Manual said it had great wood-oven pizzas
FOOD	[ pizza ]	 I ordered their signature Benvenutos pizza (with ingredients similar to some chain places' "supreme") and tap water
FOOD	[ pizza ]	This was an extraordinary pizza
FOOD	[ pizza ]	 The crust was explosive, the ingredients were pleasing  (I went to a boutique, Sicilian-personally-owned pizza place in Madison last week - - which I charitably did not rate on Yelp - -  where the otherwise-droolingly-pretty and well-assembled aggregations somehow tasted plain and  DULL - - you have to BUY good basic INGREDIENTS)
FOOD	[ O  ]	The truly odd thing about Benvenutos are the aesthetics
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is situated on a desperate strip mall, with a hideous bland exterior, that makes you think it is some pretend restaurant, living on pretentions alone
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The pretentions continue as you go to the giant counter
FOOD	[ buffet, farce ]	 And then there is this quasi-industrial interior, with huge industrial ceiling-fanned ceilings, cute semi-Vegas-italian- buffet faux-italain scrawlings on the strange pompous facades, all amidst these massive spatial proportions that are wholly intimidating, and make you think you are either in some very, very SPECIAL hallowed unknown reclusive monastery purveying mama's most lustrous home-style concoctions (which you know isn't true), or you are in the most prepostrous strip-mall farce that has ever been created
FOOD	[ pizza, pizza ]	It's a little of each, but amidst this aggregation of disparate elements, the proof is in the pizza, and the pizza is incredibly good
FOOD	[ flavor, pie, flavor, appearance ]	 A  billowing perfect crust - -  superb textures all around - -  ingredients with satisfying flavor - -  a PERFECTLY constructed pie (texture, flavor, appearance - - you name it)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nice serrvice
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm going back
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is completely and totally awful
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is hideous
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Don't go there, you will thank me
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good, reliable Italian food
FOOD	[ O  ]	A surprisingly nice restaurant for this neighborhood
FOOD	[ lemon, basil, salmon ]	I often order the lemon-basil salmon, done medium, and I like it a lot
FOOD	[ fish ]	Risky to order fish at an Italian restaurant, but it's mostly very good
FOOD	[ Pizza ]	Pizza is terrific, too
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never had a bad meal here
FOOD	[ Pasta, pizza ]	Pasta is always perfect, the pizza is wonderful and the calzones are huge and excellent
FOOD	[ pizza ]	I had my rehearsal dinner here for a pizza party and it was TOP NOTCH
FOOD	[ pizza ]	I'm still getting comments about how good the pizza was
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service for that large party and whenever its just the hubby and I has always been great
FOOD	[ Tiramisu, pasta ]	DO NOT miss the Tiramisu here!The prices are extremely high, i went here tonight with my mom and i didn't even order anything because of the prices, ($15 for a plate of pasta?
FOOD	[ calamari, fish, sandwich, fish, bun ]	Methinks not! ) my mom got calamari and it was really overcooked (i posted a picture!!) she also ordered a fish sandwich and the fish was literally half the size of the bun
FOOD	[ O  ]	Easy to get a reservation on about 30 minute's notice
FOOD	[ beer, wine ]	 Promptly seated, very attentive staff, nice but simple drink, beer, and wine list
FOOD	[ Appetizers ]	 Appetizers, salads and entrees all presented promplty and fresh from the kitchen
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food quality was excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very accomodating of our unruly 4 year old and slightly late guests
FOOD	[ event ]	 Attached to the Holiday Inn and the only real problem was the dhared parking, as we were staying at the hotel and eating at the restaurant, but had trouble getting a parking spot due to another hotel event eating up all the spots for both business
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nice but nothing special in atmosphere and surroundings
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Would definitely go back for the food next time we are staying in the hotel or a nearby hotel, but probably would not go out of my way just for the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	We go to Benvenuto's a couple times a month after work for drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bartenders are always friendly and efficient
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Such a gem to have on the Northside of Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wish I could give this place no stars
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 The place was nasty, food had no flavor, desserts were freezer burnt, and the only thing good was the McDonald's we had after we left this place disappointed!Disgusting!  I'd rather eat McDonald's over this place!The food is always good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The beers are cheap and the service is above average
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is not the cheapest place to eat but it is worth the price
FOOD	[ bucks ]	 Last time we ate there we spent less than forty bucks for two people with beers and tipI've been to this place a few times, most recently at a dinner at the beginning of a bachelorette party
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think this is a very decent option for someplace on the north east side
FOOD	[ O  ]	For the party, they were very accommodating for a larger group and us adding our own decorations to the tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	The gals hosting the party had planned it with the restaurant and had a fixed menu with three options available for everyone
FOOD	[ O  ]	It worked out really nicely for our party and the food was pretty tasty
FOOD	[ leftovers ]	I don't remember exactly what I got but I do remember enjoying the boxed up leftovers when I was hungover the next morning
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was very good considering we were a boisterous group of about 20 ladies
FOOD	[ ice, tea, glasses ]	I was having an ice tea craving that day and think I went through about 8 glasses of the stuff while we were there
FOOD	[ O  ]	The two waitresses helping our table we spot on
FOOD	[ cake ]	They even allowed us to bring in our own cake and provided plates for serving it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, I think it's decent basic Italian food, but really good at handling larger parties if you call ahead
FOOD	[ Olive ]	Expectations weren't high as I realized it was a chain but it is a definite step above Olive Garden or places like that
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I didn't feel like going out and this was the restaurant in the hotel so I figured I would give it a go
FOOD	[ calamari, dishes ]	 Glad I did because they served me one of the best fried calamari dishes I have yet to have
FOOD	[ batter, Calamari ]	 Excellent batter, tender Calamari, top notch really
FOOD	[ Penne ]	 The Penne Supreme dish was good as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I would definitely try if I were in the area and would go back if I were in the same hotel and did not feel like going out
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I believe they do the room service for this Holiday Inn Suites but you might want to check first
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had to wait a little bit to be seated this past time I went
FOOD	[ O  ]	But nothing to horrible
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices are a little high but the staff is always friendly and the food always tastes really good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Will definitely go back again
FOOD	[ O  ]	Benvenutos is exactly what you'd expect of an Americanized "Italian" restaurant
FOOD	[ bread, olive oil, parmesan, wine ]	They've got your fresh baked bread with olive oil, a wide variety of parmesan filled or topped pastas, a bunch of red wine that doesn't technically go with your meal, and some ridiculously cheesy music that really only should be played in a movie when someone is riding a gondola in Venice
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sometimes this is exactly what you want, a definite dad pleaser for my family
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sometimes you want something that actually comes from Italy, which probably couldn't be further from the menu here
FOOD	[ sirloin ]	Tonight I had a six ounce sirloin with some seasoned veggies
FOOD	[ sirloin ]	The sirloin was medium rare as requested, but pretty charred on the outside
FOOD	[ pasta ]	I suppose ill stick to pasta next time, it's what they do the most of
FOOD	[ chili ]	I also tried their chili which was good but had no kick at all
FOOD	[ minestrone, bread ]	Perhaps they meant minestrone? The best part of the meal was the fresh bread
FOOD	[ bread ]	I mean that not as knock to the meal and more as a compliment to the bread
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was seasoned really well and had a nice hardness to the outside to give it an awesome texture
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great starter!
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was about as good as you can get from a restaurant that had their waiters write on your table in classy crayon
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place looks nicer than a Chilis, but when they start the meal by demonstrating your tablecloth is actually a roll of paper it sets the tone for a pretty laid back meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went to the Benvenuto's on the south sidee, you can see my review there, but this is nothing special
FOOD	[ O  ]	My cousins and I ate here before a movie with their friend
FOOD	[ bread, soup ]	They like it, and they have the bread that's pretty good, but the menu isn't really the same and I was disappointed that they had only three soup options
FOOD	[ appetizer, bread ]	For an appetizer, they give you a pretty decent tasting bread
FOOD	[ olive oil ]	It's soft and there is olive oil to go with it
FOOD	[ baskets ]	They brought us two baskets for our table of 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not bad
FOOD	[ soup, Tomato, Basil, Minestrone ]	I wanted to order soup, but all they had was Tomato Basil and Minestrone
FOOD	[ Portabella, Penne ]	Neither of those sounded really appealing so I ordered Portabella Penne
FOOD	[ salad, soup ]	She asked if I wanted a salad or soup to add, and I asked what my options were
FOOD	[ salad, Caesar salad ]	It's a house salad or a Caesar salad, but there is an upcharge, which she didn't tell me
FOOD	[ Olive ]	I thought perhaps it was like Olive Garden and it came with the meal, but no
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was extra
FOOD	[ O  ]	As I said in my other location, definitely order the dressing on the side
FOOD	[ O  ]	I practiced that again and boy was I happy I did or it would have been drowning
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, it wasn't terrible, but it was nothing to write home about
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wouldn't go there again if I didn't have to
FOOD	[ O  ]	In fairness, I'd give a 3
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 for this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	It wasn't a 4 star place though, hence rounding down
FOOD	[ O  ]	I read reviews before going and had an idea what to expect
FOOD	[ pizza, pasta, appetizer ]	 My husband got the pizza and I got the pasta plus the sample platter appetizer
FOOD	[ pizza ]	The pizza was the star, with good quality ingredients and nice thin crust
FOOD	[ pasta ]	 The pasta was disappointing at best
FOOD	[ bruschetta, chicken, pasta ]	 I got the bruschetta chicken pasta which sounded really good and looked pretty
FOOD	[ pasta ]	However, there was just about nothing on the plate but a huge pile of pasta
FOOD	[ coat, pasta ]	 Not well seasoned, no where near enough sauce to coat even half of the pasta
FOOD	[ chicken ]	 Two measly pieces of grilled chicken
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I regretted my order almost immediately
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sample platter was ridiculously huge
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Seriously enough for 4+ people to get full
FOOD	[ cheese, bread ]	 I was unimpressed with everything on the platter, especially the cheese bread
FOOD	[ butter, cheese ]	 Not good seasoning, tasted like fake butter with too much cheese left me feeling greasy
FOOD	[ cheese ]	 And I LOVE cheese
FOOD	[ leftovers ]	With leftovers, we had food for 3 days
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waiter was hard to find and didn't keep our water full
FOOD	[ bread, olive oil, herb ]	 The unlimited bread was decent with an olive oil herb dipping sauce
FOOD	[ pizza, pie ]	 I would go back for the pizza so in the end, this place is saved by the pie
FOOD	[ O  ]	We have been dining here for quite a few years now
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It has consistently good food
FOOD	[ pizza ]	  The pizza is fantastic
FOOD	[ gourmet, basil ]	 They don't have an increased topping charge for "gourmet" toppings like basil
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I find that annoying at other restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They do not skimp on toppings either
FOOD	[ basil ]	  I ordered basil and got plenty of it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not just a few pieces strewn about
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ O  ]	We have always enjoyed our meals here
FOOD	[ salmon, pasta ]	 The salmon tasted fresh and the pasta is very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have specials and change up the menu on occasion
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service is always great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Everyone there seems happy to serve you, not just doing their job
FOOD	[ O  ]	We have had them cater a lunch for about 50 people at work and they did an excellent job
FOOD	[ diet ]	 They accommodated for a special diet restriction without reservation
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is not fair to compare this place to an Italian restaurant in Chicago or any other big city
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you want Chicago Italian food, go to Chicago
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place to eat with good service
FOOD	[ Taco ]	I couldn't find Taco City but the Rocky's/TacoCity are the same business
FOOD	[ soft shell, tacos, tacos ]	 The soft shell tacos are small I'm used to big hungry-man's portion of tacos
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Did they change the size?  It seemed to take forever in the drive-thru and I was the only customer in line
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Do they just fool-around since their used to closing so early
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was right after 8pm but not close to 9pm
FOOD	[ pizza ]	I always order my pizza thru pickup so I'm surprised they haven't shut down yet
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What   would I do if they shut down?The drive thru is the issue here
FOOD	[ O  ]	One word SLOW
FOOD	[ min ]	I'm a huge Rockys fan but I'll drive to the east side location bc this location is just way too slow! It takes a solid 10-15 min
FOOD	[ pizza ]	For the drive thru and sometimes the pizza is old and  nasty bc its sat too long
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's too bad bc there's not alot of competition on the north side
FOOD	[ O  ]	they are now CLOSED FOR BUSINESS! You have to go to the eastside one now if you want to have Rocky's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really efficient denny's! Great in a pinch
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great staff, open 24-7, clean, and they have security there at night so when things started to get shaky with certain customers they fix the issue fastHorrible food
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	It takes real effort to botch up a turkey sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	so because of their obvious diligence in that regard, I'm giving them one star
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's Denny's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What can I say
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Typical chain food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Kids love it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Comfortable atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Prices are low
FOOD	[ starters ]	For starters, this place has a very strong moldy smell to it
FOOD	[ O  ]	From looking at the old stained carpets, this seems where it may be comming from
FOOD	[ glass ]	 Next, I ordered a soda and my glass was dirty and had oily stains from it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've been to other Denny's Resturants, but this by far is the dirtiest establishment I've been to
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was afraid to try the food, fearing that the Kitchen (shielded from view) would be worse than what customers are able to see
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I would recommend someone inspect the air quality and cleaniness of this establishment
FOOD	[ fast food ]	My favorite place for fast food in Madison - I have both locations in my cell phone for quicker pickup
FOOD	[ Shrimp, Cream Sauce, Crawfish, Cream Sauce ]	 If it's Thursday try the Shrimp in Cream Sauce or Crawfish in Cream Sauce special
FOOD	[ Red Beans, Rice, Sausage ]	any other day, the Red Beans'n'Rice with Double Sausage will never treat you wrong!Arguably the best thing about Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Real
FOOD	[ O  ]	Legit
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not Playing
FOOD	[ shrimp, etouffee ]	Close your eyes, bite into the shrimp etouffee, and you feel like the gulf is close
FOOD	[ O  ]	I lived near the Monroe St
FOOD	[ O  ]	location and frequented this place regularly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Everything is super fresh and authentic
FOOD	[ crawfish, cornbread ]	I was always a big fan of the crawfish etoufee with a big slab of cornbread
FOOD	[ spice ]	 The spice could be a little inconsistent though, which is probably a result of having super fresh spices one time and then not the next time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No big deal though as it was always delicious either way
FOOD	[ O  ]	I regret that I have never had a po' boy from this place, but that is something I will have to remedy ASAP
FOOD	[ O  ]	I also wish that it was easier to eat at the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	I know it is takeout, but it always sucked having to walk home smelling the beautiful aromas roll out of the box
FOOD	[ O  ]	Or, alternatively when it was 40 below/snowing/raining/etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	New Orleans Take Out is all around greatness
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I absolutely love this place and everything on the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When I was a kid the best times were when my father would take an afternoon delivery to the east side and swing by NOTO on the way back
FOOD	[ rush ]	 It was always such a great surprise when my sister and I would be called in for dinner, and right away you could smell those spices!  Those are some of my favorite memories, and to this day I get a rush of excitement just walking in to the place when I get that first waft
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It really is the best outside of the Gulf
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really can't even start on what my favorites are because every time I pick something off the menu it becomes my new favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The po' boys are without exception great
FOOD	[ beef ]	 The roast beef was my first love, and I keep coming back to this one
FOOD	[ French bread, sandwich ]	 The French bread is perfect - crisp and the perfect texture for the sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It took me a while to try the fried oyster po' boy - I was not so adventurous as a kid - but after trying this I see why this is my mother's favorite
FOOD	[ shrimp, fried chicken ]	 The Gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This place is a 5 star easily on the strength of the po' boys alone, but the rest of the menu is not to be skipped
FOOD	[ jambalaya, heat, Tabasco ]	 The jambalaya is great for those that can't take too much heat, and even better with a bit of Tabasco for those that can
FOOD	[ shrimp, creole, heat ]	 The shrimp creole - HOO BOY!  Spicy but not excessive, it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot on
FOOD	[ shrimp, etouffee ]	 Same for the shrimp etouffee
FOOD	[ red beans, rice, sausage ]	 The red beans & rice with double sausage is my all-time favorite comfort food
FOOD	[ Gras ]	 Most of the time I can't make up my mind, so I hit up the Mardi Gras combo, which gives you all three
FOOD	[ cornbread ]	 Perfection!  And it all comes with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've only been to the Fordem location, though there is another on Monroe Street
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm certain that had I not graduated prior to this location opening I would have made it a regular destination
FOOD	[ O  ]	 As it is, I love coming down Sherman then Fordem, and you're suddenly right there looking at the mural on the side of the building
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I call ahead whenever I plan to stop, but about half the time it is straight up impulse that brings me there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No matter whatever else happens that day, it's always a good day if you've been to New Orleans Take Out
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never been to New Orleans, so I don't know if that makes me somehow less qualified to review this place
FOOD	[ China ]	 But, I suspect a fair amount of people have never been to China, and it doesn't stop them from reviewing PF Changs
FOOD	[ O  ]	ANYWAY, the thing about NOTO whenever I have eaten there is that I am always expecting it to be way greater than it really is because of the way people talk about it
FOOD	[ flavor, cayenne pepper ]	 I am always expecting this transcendent experience, but really, all I get is a styrofoam container of some spicy slop that really has no real flavor underneath the initial tongue shock of cayenne pepper
FOOD	[ Cajun ]	This is definitely the place for Cajun
FOOD	[ lemonade ]	When you go in there I want you to expect a special of the day, homemade lemonade, and a everything made from scratch type feel
FOOD	[ O  ]	This isn't a place where you meet a hostess and they seat you
FOOD	[ beans, rice ]	Just expect the best beans and rice outside of New Orleans
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am kind of in love with this place
FOOD	[ chicken, french roll, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, fried chicken, breast ]	The chicken po' boy has haunted me ever since I left Madison back in 2000 - perfect french roll, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and seasoned fried chicken breast = what you need
FOOD	[ rice ]	Also what you need? an order of dirty rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	And that shit is spicy! Get a soda from the machine out front and walk to Tenny Park
FOOD	[ O  ]	Life is good
FOOD	[ french bread ]	back in my younger days of bakery, I worked at the bakery that supplied NOTO with french bread
FOOD	[ color ]	  It had to be a certain length, a certain crust, and a certain color if it wasn't
FOOD	[ O  ]	YIKES!!
FOOD	[ bread ]	I figured if he had such a high standard of quality for his bread, that the same mind of detail would apply to his food, and I was right
FOOD	[ O  ]	, I used to eat at his restuarant faithfully every week
FOOD	[ O  ]	then i moved :(
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was in town so I stopped in on friday for some lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food was excellent
FOOD	[ fish, pecan, meuniere, cod ]	  I ordered the fried fish with sauce pecan meuniere and the fried cod po' boy
FOOD	[ bread, bread ]	  The bread was ok (I stand by the bread we used to make years ago
FOOD	[ fish, lettuce, tomato, pickle ]	it was just perfect), the fish was fried to perfection and the lettuce, tomato, and pickle were just right
FOOD	[ fish, pecan ]	   as for the fried fish with the pecan sauce,   I got a half order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 wasn't enough
FOOD	[ rice, fish ]	 I had forgotten just how great the sauce with the rice and the fish really were
FOOD	[ O  ]	   
FOOD	[ O  ]	Go here for some great food
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of my all time favorite places in Madison;  I like it so much that I had them cater my wedding
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have been eating at NOTO for at least 20 years, and the food is consistently good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I always have a hard time deciding what to get
FOOD	[ shrimp, etouffee, shrimp, Creole sauce, pecan, fish, Cajun, meatballs, cornbread ]	the shrimp etouffee?  A shrimp po' boy with Creole sauce?  Or one of the daily specials like the pecan fish or the Cajun meatballs?  The cornbread is also worth noting for its yumminess
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm a total foodie and Chicago is great for me except we don't have NOTO
FOOD	[ Creole, Cajun ]	The best of the best for Creole/Cajun
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lived down south, been to N'awlins many times when I was a kid in the 70's
FOOD	[ O  ]	NOTO is the best hands down
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wish some adventuresome entrepreneur would migrate NOTO down to Chicago
FOOD	[ O  ]	It would be a huge success I am sure
FOOD	[ O  ]	We don't have anything that is even close to as good so we have to make our own or take a trip up to Madison! :)Ever since my husband (native to Madison) took me here, I always make several trips out from Chicago every year
FOOD	[ Shrimp, Creole, Red Beans, Rice, sausage, Gumbo, Chicken, Jambalaya ]	otherwise my cravings for the Shrimp Creole, Red Beans and Rice with double sausage, Gumbo, Chicken Po' Boy, Jambalaya, and really anything else Roussos has got goin' on that day
FOOD	[ O  ]	will cause me to go into NOTO withdrawal
FOOD	[ flavor ]	Oh! And who can forget the Panola hot sauce he uses! There is so much soul in this food and super flavor, but really it's Roussos' own personal touch that makes it so unique
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is truly special
FOOD	[ appetite ]	So get yo' self out to NOTO but make sure to bring your appetite!this place is on my list at least a couple times a month, and it's probably the only restaurant in madison that can claim that
FOOD	[ crawfish ]	The only thing I've got to say on the negative side is the crawfish off season are a bit mealy and I have switched to shimp
FOOD	[ beans, rice ]	 everything else is spot on, esp the read beans and rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 oh, and it's closed on  sunday
FOOD	[ O  ]	which is always the day you start to crave a po' boy
FOOD	[ O  ]	What do I say you get
FOOD	[ shrimp, creole, bean, rice, meat ]	 for 2 ppl, we get a full order of shrimp etoufee, shimp creole and a red bean and rice double meat
FOOD	[ french bread ]	 all with french bread
FOOD	[ O  ]	 it's a ton of food but oh so good
FOOD	[ O  ]	My boyfriend and I discuss food often and he talked about his place with reverence always
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Well OMG
FOOD	[ O  ]	it REALLY is special
FOOD	[ chicken ]	 A simple chicken poboy made right
FOOD	[ curry, chicken, creole, cheeseburger ]	 Dipping it into certain soups of the day (curry chicken and creole cheeseburger were my favorites)
FOOD	[ dipping sauces ]	 We call them dipping sauces (lol) and have even gone so far as to plan a trip to Madison based on the soups that day
FOOD	[ etouffe, flavor ]	 And their etouffe labelled "too hot to eat" actually lives up to its name while still retaining seriously good flavor is another rare find indeed
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oyster Po'Boy is money
FOOD	[ bread ]	 Their bread is really good and the taste is unique
FOOD	[ Jambalaya ]	The Jambalaya is better than I've had in New Orleans
FOOD	[ O  ]	New Orleans Take out is one of the best values in the city
FOOD	[ O  ]	Can't say enough about it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food for a good price
FOOD	[ O  ]	I finally got to try out the New Orleans Take Out Restaurant and was fairly impressed
FOOD	[ black beans, rice ]	The wife and I split an order of etoufee and black beans and rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was plenty of food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing too fancy, but it was tasty
FOOD	[ dishes ]	I will definitely be going back and will hopefully try out a poboy and some of their other dishes
FOOD	[ O  ]	For the people saying no place to sit
FOOD	[ onion ]	Are you sure you are rating the correct location? They had plenty of tables there complete with copies of the northside news paper, isthmus and the onion
FOOD	[ O  ]	Went here for the first time last night
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thought i'd give it try based on the ratings
FOOD	[ red beans, rice, sausage, shrimp, creole ]	Im originally from the south so i was a little aprehensive about trying it, but thankfully i was totally suprised! Husband had the red beans n rice with smoked sausage, i had the shrimp creole and we got a half order of wings
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything was excellent and very authentic
FOOD	[ Cajun ]	Although i will warn you, it is not for those with sensitive mouths! Cajun is spicy food and this def lived up to that! Will be going backSince I lived in Madison (about 8 years ago) the po' boys at NOTO have haunted me!  The pursuit of a po' boy as good as this has eluded me through 4 cities and countless "nope, not as good"s
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm such a fan I bought a tank top on my last visit!
FOOD	[ bread, shrimp, crawfish, chicken ]	Perfect bread, perfect seasonings - be it oyster, shrimp, crawfish or chicken
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	   Whenever I'm back in Madison (which is, unfortunately, rarely, I take friends to get a "sandwich as big as yo head" and they never leave disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	As I remember it, NOTO is that kind of hole in the wall place that newcomers hesitate to try out
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	 My advice - do it!  As much as I love these sandwiches I hardly ever order them out anymore because I know they will never be as good as at New Orleans Take Out in Madison, WI
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love the food here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love the vibe
FOOD	[ O  ]	Allow me to express my undying love for New Orleans Take-Out
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	I lived in Madison almost 8 years ago and have yet to find another shrimp po' boy even remotely close to the delicacy at NOTO
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's one of those hole in the wall places that looks scary and not hygienic on the outside but is completely amazing and totally worth it
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	I remember the first time my dad took me for a "sandwich as big as yo head
FOOD	[ O  ]	" I had just taken the ACT as a 6th grader and afterwards all I was really capable of was mumbling simple sentences
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	I remember being surprised that dad wasn't kidding, the sandwich really was as big as my head
FOOD	[ O  ]	And that it was like, really awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	My fam were instantly regulars
FOOD	[ O  ]	8 years and 3 citites later, the search continues
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	I'm not even asking for a better sandwich (I don't think one exists), but one that's just as good (it seems like that doesn't exist either)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh and if this review sounds similar to the one by Sheena F
FOOD	[ O  ]	it's because she's my sister
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a family obsession
FOOD	[ shrimp, jambalaya, cornbread ]	Good shrimp jambalaya but great cornbread in a developing neighborhood
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A future spot on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives show
FOOD	[ O  ]	Been to New Orleans
FOOD	[ O  ]	this place is just as good as anything there
FOOD	[ shrimp, cream sauce ]	 Today's shrimp in cream sauce was outstanding
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food, slightly high prices
FOOD	[ crawfish, etouffee, cajun ]	I had the crawfish etouffee, my standard cajun dish
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was quite good
FOOD	[ red beans, rice, sausage ]	 My brother had red beans and rice with sausage, which he loved
FOOD	[ red beans, rice ]	 Our friend had red beans and rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All were good
FOOD	[ leftovers ]	 No leftovers, but we were full
FOOD	[ lemonade, bacon ]	 The fresh lemonade was good; the maple bacon pralin was meh
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not the friendliest staff, but this place is one of the true gems in town all things-considered
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food but totally overpriced
FOOD	[ O  ]	While in Madison for a ski trip, I tapped into the almighty resource that is Yelp to find some unique eats
FOOD	[ O  ]	I didn't want to eat any of the other chain garbage that all the other tourists were eating near the hotel
FOOD	[ O  ]	Enter NOTO
FOOD	[ O  ]	What an awesome little find!
FOOD	[ O  ]	After reading some of the reviews, I wanted to try a little bit of everything
FOOD	[ Gras, Shrimp, sandwich ]	The woman at the counter suggested we try the Mardi Gras Combo and the popular Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich
FOOD	[ rice, rice, rice ]	I wanted to try the dirty rice and was told that I could substitute the regular rice in the Combo for dirty rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes, please!
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	First, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out to be
FOOD	[ French roll ]	It's a standard French roll with a standard amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best I've ever had
FOOD	[ shrimp, lettuce ]	The juxtaposition of creamy, tangy sauce with the crunchy, juicy shrimp combined with the fresh lettuce will have you swooning for more
FOOD	[ O  ]	On to the combo
FOOD	[ O  ]	What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G
FOOD	[ creole ]	) of beautifully tasty french creole goodness all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box
FOOD	[ O  ]	It traveled several miles successfully in the manner as well
FOOD	[ rice, shrimp, creole ]	The warnings of the menu and lady at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate
FOOD	[ spice ]	It was a flavorful, creeping sort of spice that increased with each bite
FOOD	[ O  ]	Absolutely fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	The name "take-out" is rather misleading because there is ample seating inside the place and many interesting jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll definitely be making a stop here again whenever I'm in the Madison area for some good ol' N'Orleans style cookin'
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've always meant to order from  here, but I used to go to New Orleans so often that it's never been pressing issue
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finally, one day the cravings got to us, so we tried the place out
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place was exceptionally easy to order from
FOOD	[ O  ]	They don't play 1,000 questions with you, which is nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu is easy to find online if you don't have a paper copy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I admit, when I picked up our order and got it home, we were slightly dismayed at the quantity
FOOD	[ dishes ]	We ordered two dishes for three people
FOOD	[ O  ]	We spend a lot of time in the Big Easy and have become accustomed to ordering from the locals' joints which cater to the service people
FOOD	[ O  ]	Large portions, cheap prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	Then we tasted it
FOOD	[ jambalaya ]	We had the large trio (combination of a few things) and it was so good -- the flavors were great, the stuff was actually spicy, and I found I could love jambalaya (normally not a fan)
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	 We also go a shrimp po'boy -- I was so excited that it tasted almost exactly at the one we get from our normal go-to place in the Quarter
FOOD	[ O  ]	While the quantity was less than we expected, the quality was superior to what we get at our little dive joints
FOOD	[ flavor ]	You can definitely see they emphasize flavor and texture, rather than giving you a week's worth of food
FOOD	[ dishes ]	That works for me -- we were all full off our dishes and very happy
FOOD	[ flavor ]	Overall felt like the food lacked flavor
FOOD	[ jambalaya, gumbo ]	The jambalaya and gumbo seemed blah to both of us
FOOD	[ BBQ, shrimp, cornbread ]	The BBQ shrimp and cornbread were both good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have been going to both of the NOTO places for many years now, I would have gone four stars but there are some quality problems at the eastside shop
FOOD	[ dishes, vegetables ]	 It is closest to our house so we would like to go there but over the years we have gotten a few inedible poorly prepared dishes from the east side establishment and when it is good it still seems lower quality vegetables and such, less fresh like the food has been in a steam table for a while
FOOD	[ O  ]	The downtown establishment I have never had a bad dish from as a result we drive across the isthmus to get takeout which is a bit of a schlep so we order from them less often then we might otherwise
FOOD	[ gumbo, chicken, fish, pecans ]	best place ever and good gumbo and chicken filetHubby had the fish with pecans, and LOVED it
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	I, on the other hand had an absolutely pitiful shrimp Po Boy
FOOD	[ bread, shrimp, bread, cover, lettuce, tomatoes ]	 Big ole piece of bread, 8 shrimp set on the bread to try to cover space (it doesn't), smidge of lettuce (not necessarily a bad thing), and mushy disgusting tomatoes
FOOD	[ bread ]	 Take a bite, and all you taste is bread
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Never again
FOOD	[ red beans, rice, cornbread, rice, fries ]	I had the red beans and white rice with cornbread, dirty rice, fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not quite what my granny used to make
FOOD	[ rice, rice, beans, flavor ]	But the dirty rice was spicy and I added it to the bland white rice and beans to add flavor to it
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was ok buy upset my stomach
FOOD	[ Cornbread ]	Cornbread was dense and moist? Flavorless though
FOOD	[ buttery, cornbread ]	I wanted some warm buttery cornbread goodness
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nope
FOOD	[ fries, bbq ]	The fries and bbq sauce was all I liked in my order
FOOD	[ Cajun ]	I love this place!!!! It's an authentic hole in the wall kind if place with the best Cajun food in Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have been to New Orleans and eating here takes me right back! The food is fresh and delicious! My favorite way to treat myself
FOOD	[ O  ]	Highly recommendI just love this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing else like in Madison!Can I give zero stars? I didn't even get to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	As soon as we walked in the cashier looked at us and walked in the back and never came back out
FOOD	[ O  ]	The cooks were outside smoking and gossiping about the night before's drunk
FOOD	[ O  ]	This was at 6 pm
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prime dinner time
FOOD	[ O  ]	The tables were all dirty
FOOD	[ O  ]	The visible part of the kitchen was messy and cross contaminated
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, we were flagrantly ignored
FOOD	[ O  ]	We left after ten minutes of non-service
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was very sad because I had heard such good reviews and the menu looked good, but the facilities were sketchy
FOOD	[ shrimp, etouffe, beverage ]	love the too hot to eat shrimp etouffe favorite spicy dish in madison all the kinds of po boys ive tried have been very good could have better beverage selection i like the cornbreadSo much on the menu, I wish I could have tried more
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I made the decision to go with a half order and should have gone with the full
FOOD	[ beans ]	 The beans are amazing - I ran into a some great flavors
FOOD	[ rice ]	The rice is just right not mushy not hard
FOOD	[ french bread, butter ]	 The french bread is yum, though I personally could use heaps of butter on it
FOOD	[ red beans, rice, sausage ]	Good mercy this red beans and rice with sausage is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wish I had found this place sooner
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices are reasonable too
FOOD	[ O  ]	4 *'s because it's my first time there and "Yay! I'm a fan
FOOD	[ O  ]	" Hope to make it 5 after the next visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	A Madison institution for all the right reasons
FOOD	[ O  ]	The soups are just perfect
FOOD	[ Creole, cheeseburger ]	Creole cheeseburger is one you should try
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Po boys  are my favorite
FOOD	[ rice, beans ]	The rice and beans are overpriced
FOOD	[ O  ]	John is the original owner and totally legit
FOOD	[ O  ]	Place looks like a Louisiana dive, but is clean
FOOD	[ O  ]	Counter service only
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Decent menu selections, better than average service for a restaurant outside of downtown, and a fair price
FOOD	[ game ]	 It is hardly authentic, but we dine with our six year old often and Pedro's is a great place for kids or to go after work to watch the game
FOOD	[ salsa ]	 They have changed the salsa twice and it still sucks
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was informed by the manager that the old recipe was 'too spicy' for people in this overgrown Mayberry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Over all it is decent with pretty good service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 4 stars are for value and service
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	There really should be some kind of board that gives accrediation to restaurants claiming to be "Mexican
FOOD	[ Taco, Mexican ]	" That way the consumer would know that places like Taco Bell, Pedro's and ChiChi's (if they're even still open) are not really Mexican restaurants, even though they purport to be
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	That way folks wouldn't be fooled into eating at a "Mexican Restaurante" just because there's an "e" at the end of "Restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	" 
FOOD	[ Taco, Mexican ]	After my meal at Pedro's, I decided to just hit up Taco Bell the next time I'm in Madison and I want "Mexican
FOOD	[ O  ]	" It's just as crappy as this place, but far easier on the pocketbook
FOOD	[ cuisine ]	This place is an afront to the people of Mexico and their cuisine
FOOD	[ O  ]	By all common sense i should detest this place, over-salted food
FOOD	[ O  ]	check, stereotypical music
FOOD	[ O  ]	yup
FOOD	[ O  ]	includes ranch in food
FOOD	[ O  ]	oh yes
FOOD	[ margaritas, happy hour, tortillas ]	(and then there are the monstrous portion sizes) I keep coming back because they have 1/2 priced margaritas on Thursdays, a fairly decent happy hour, fresh tortillas, fresh ingredients, and decent service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food plays to the lowest common denominator so my friends who hate all things not-American food can find something they enjoy
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	If you want authentic Mexican go to S
FOOD	[ O  ]	Park Street and hit up El Pastor
FOOD	[ O  ]	(for serious) Also If you have to choose between the east side Pedro's or the west side location
FOOD	[ O  ]	hands down pick the west
FOOD	[ chicken, fajitas ]	(east is a tad dumpy)All I ever get here are the chicken fajitas and those are fairly hard to screw up
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Anything else I've tired here has been sub-par
FOOD	[ tortillas ]	 Really, the best thing about this place is the freshly-made tortillas
FOOD	[ O  ]	First of all, they charged us to split an entree
FOOD	[ O  ]	 In fact, we had to do the splitting - I guess they charge to have access to an extra plate
FOOD	[ mushrooms, enchilada ]	 The mushrooms in our enchilada were canned, and then burned
FOOD	[ Spaghetti ]	 The ranchero sauce tasted like the red sauce that comes with Spaghetti-O's
FOOD	[ chips, salsa ]	  The chips and salsa was less spectacular than the stuff I buy on sale at the grocery store
FOOD	[ Mexican, margaritas ]	 The part I depend on most to get me through crappy Mexican food - margaritas - also disappointed
FOOD	[ tequila ]	 They tasted like Kool-Aid (but without adequate water) and lacked tequila
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This was all at the west side location, and I hear the east side is even worse
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No vuelvo
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not even the hungriest, rabid infested pack of Chihuahuas would touch this food
FOOD	[ O  ]	All their food is canned process nonsense
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's like Mc Donalds on Mescaline
FOOD	[ tortillas ]	Now the freshly made tortillas are good, but that's it
FOOD	[ Mexican, enchilada, dishes ]	I'm not going to lie to you, this food is nowhere near Mexican, but the enchilada suiza is delicious in it's own right (ignore the side dishes, blech!)
FOOD	[ margaritas ]	 The margaritas are delicious, and if you go on half-price Thursdays, very reasonable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have a good price on their lunch menu
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	  I wouldn't say I recommend it necessarily if you are looking for authentic Mexican
FOOD	[ O  ]	buuut, eh, it's tasty once in a while
FOOD	[ fish ]	it is Pedros, but the baked Friday night fish is the best I had in Madison
FOOD	[ rye bread, chipotle, coleslaw ]	 Great texture, spices, the rye bread, chipotle sauce and coleslaw were great too
FOOD	[ tortillas ]	  Of course the freshly baked tortillas were fattening and awesome
FOOD	[ fish ]	 The atmoshpere is a little off, but a great surpise for Friday fish
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	Does anyone in Madison consider this a great Mexican food location? Both of my experiences at Pedro's have left me disheartened
FOOD	[ O  ]	They go a little something like this:
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thursday night
FOOD	[ margaritas ]	Friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas
FOOD	[ feet, tequila ]	Am   approached by a girl who wants me to go out with her father standing 10 feet away, who ironically is the least creepy of the crowd looking to enjoy cheap tequila
FOOD	[ O  ]	Implementing Gym Rules, i
FOOD	[ O  ]	baseball cap and hoodie upon my next visit post 9pm
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wednesday evening
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dinner with a friend
FOOD	[ O  ]	Server who may or may not go on living if she stops texting, poor quality food and terrible lighting, which is imperative unless practicing G
FOOD	[ O  ]	(see above
FOOD	[ fajita ]	Being a girl from the southwest, I have had a great fajita or two in my day
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	If you are feeling rebellious and decide to go despite the many poor reviews, know this: Mexican food is great, and this is nowhere near that
FOOD	[ O  ]	Let me just get this out of the way
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	I grew up in Madison and for years this was my favorite Mexican place
FOOD	[ O  ]	I thought it was the best possible place
FOOD	[ O  ]	anywhere
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	Then I moved to Phoenix and had real Mexican food and now
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wanted to review this place because it's not as bad as some of the other reviewers are making it sound
FOOD	[ salsa, chips ]	Their salsa and chips are fresh and some of the best around
FOOD	[ tortillas ]	They serve you fresh warm tortillas with your meal that go well with anything
FOOD	[ quesadillas ]	Some of the pre-meal quesadillas are fantastic
FOOD	[ Bean, Burrito ]	My favorite dish here is the Bean Burrito with red sauce
FOOD	[ beans, cheese ]	The way the beans and cheese are melted together just makes it so craveable
FOOD	[ O  ]	Still, a lot of this food is simply not authentic, and more than a few are on the heavy side
FOOD	[ O  ]	You will walk away feeling full and likely be on the toilet for a little while the next day
FOOD	[ O  ]	There is no way around this
FOOD	[ mexican ]	The simple truth is that there is no superb mexican food here in Madison, and Pedro's fits right in to this muddy amalgam of mediocrity
FOOD	[ O  ]	Some things it does well though, and the cheap drinks on a Thursday night usually make for a good atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They had a great Valentine's Day special that we went here for, and the service was prompt and we got our food quickly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our waiter was friendly (they have been whenever I've gone) and the food was pretty tasty
FOOD	[ Mexican, Seafood ]	 All in all, not much to separate Pedro's from the other Mexican restaurants in the area, and it certainly isn't the best out there, but decent in price, quality and service for sure (the Seafood Suiza is the best there, in my honest opinion, but all other foods are just ok)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went here last night slummin'
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Uh huh, that's right, I said it
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	This is not the go to place for authentic Mexican food, by now most people know this
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's what many would call "Americanized
FOOD	[ enchiladas ]	"  I had the enchiladas suiza
FOOD	[ cheese, spinach ]	 One with cheese, one with spinach
FOOD	[ cheese ]	 The flavors appealed to the "fat American who likes cheese" in me
FOOD	[ spinach, leaf ]	 The freezer burned spinach with crunchy leaf stems was not so pleasing however
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	I wasn't overly offended by anything, because I went in here knowing it would be mediocre Americanized Mexican food complete with kitschy  decor
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bonuses of the night included well, not much, but hey, the waitress was hot
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like this place
FOOD	[ mexican ]	When you go there you know what you are going to get; warm cheesy comfort food, that is definitely not mexican
FOOD	[ O  ]	But if you go there knowing what to expect, you won't be disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	Check their name of the day, you get a free meal! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	And its fun to go for half price margs on Tuesdays and Thursday, which usually coincides with karaoke or the fueling pianos
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I like what one reviewer said though, def don't dress up of you are going to drink here
FOOD	[ O  ]	You will get hit on by creepers and townies
FOOD	[ O  ]	The item you pick for your dinner can quite literally make or break the experience here
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	 That is, your cheesy, Americanized Mexican food experience
FOOD	[ tamale ]	 I tried the vegetarian tamale and it was nothing less than awful
FOOD	[ cheese, flavor ]	 No cheese anywhere, no flavor, just HOT
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Ok yes, the menu indicates this a "spicy" dish, but it didn't indicate its high degree of suck
FOOD	[ O  ]	Unfortunately on this particular visit we didn't get a hot waitress
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Instead we got a disenchanted guy who apparently didn't want a very big tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	 His heavy sighs, eye rolls, and general lack of even being around 99% of the time led me to believe he was channeling his inner emo and couldn't be bothered
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were sat next to a group of teenage girls, which by automatic default says "we hate you and want you to die
FOOD	[ O  ]	"  They talked very loudly about their sexual escapades and did that annoying screech laughing
FOOD	[ ass ]	 I get it, I was a teenager once too, but if I could go back in time I'd kick my own teenaged ass
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food, service, and ambiance was like the time I fell off my motorcycle and got really bad road rash
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I hope I won't be doing that again any time soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pedros is a staple in the community
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A great place where you can bring family and friends to have a really good time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is all made fresh, which is great
FOOD	[ beat ]	 For the price and the selection, you really can't beat it
FOOD	[ O  ]	One other thing to mention
FOOD	[ event ]	 Have had a group event at Pedro's - and also a couple events catered
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The catering menu is great - and they make it really easy
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	You cannot compare Pedro's to the other big Mexican food presence, Laredo's
FOOD	[ tortillas ]	 Pedro's has home made tortillas, Laredo's does not
FOOD	[ bowl, salsa ]	 Pedro's gives you a much bigger bowl of salsa that Laredo's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I never have to look around for a refill
FOOD	[ salsa ]	 But the salsa tastes vary different between the two restaurants
FOOD	[ Mexican, rice ]	 The Mexican rice at Pedro's is very tomatoey (?)  Service at Pedro's is not as good as Laredo's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Overall, Pedro's deserves a look
FOOD	[ O  ]	This West location is now CLOSED
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Owner would like to reopen in the future
FOOD	[ O  ]	Opinions are a changing
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Went to Pedros over the weekend
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Tamales were not good
FOOD	[ heat ]	 The sauce had formed a skin on the top because it sat under the heat lamps too long
FOOD	[ pork ]	 I took three bites before I found any pork
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I ate half of one and the waiter asked if I wanted to take the rest home
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When I said no, my satisfaction was not questioned
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'll stick with Laredos
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I could give no stars, I would have
FOOD	[ O  ]	Coming from Texas, this place is a disappointment
FOOD	[ O  ]	It just sucks
FOOD	[ Mexican, tortilla ]	They have real Mexican's working for them, yet they can't even make an even tortilla
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are always puffy, misshapen, to thick etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	Most of the food comes out cold and doesn't even make sense
FOOD	[ O  ]	Disgusting!The west side location was way better
FOOD	[ O  ]	After they shut down I started going to this one
FOOD	[ tortillas ]	The food isn't as good and the fresh made tortillas are always either hard, cold, or burnt
FOOD	[ O  ]	Half the time I'm there they screw up my order
FOOD	[ O  ]	One time there was a miscommunication between the waitress and my boyfriend which ended up costing us $7
FOOD	[ O  ]	It wouldn't have been that big of a deal if the manager at first told the waitress to tell us she wasn't there and when she did finally come out she didn't apologize, make any effort into making the situation any better, and then started repeating the same thing over and over again so we'd shut up
FOOD	[ O  ]	A couple of my friends and I have decided to never go back here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hopefully the west side one will open up again
FOOD	[ fajitas, tortillas, tortilla ]	The fajitas were awesome and the tortillas were fresh from the tortilla-machine which was kinda fascinating
FOOD	[ corn ]	Delicious corn cakes
FOOD	[ fish, tacos, fish, tortilla ]	The fish tacos however were shitty, the fish was fishy, dry and not enough of it, Maciek had a dry tortilla, which is weird since they were all fresh and everything
FOOD	[ O  ]	All in all it was pretty good and the service was great, they stayed open way past closing time for us
FOOD	[ mexican ]	Stopped at this place on a ride from Minnesota to Chicago, on my way back to california--the beacon of good mexican food in the US
FOOD	[ O  ]	so I was excited to see what this place had to offer! Very friendly staff and reasonable prices on  generous portions
FOOD	[ chips, salsa, tortillas, butter, sugar ]	We were started off with the customary chips and salsa, which was quite tasty, and then a fun treat--warm fluffy tortillas which we could put butter or sugar on
FOOD	[ O  ]	These were amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	I liked this change
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was getting full by this point and the entree hadn't even been served
FOOD	[ O  ]	We also got some guac which was made in a cool manner with some great ingredients table side
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious
FOOD	[ corn, cake ]	When my vegetarian tamales finally came, I was already pretty full and managed to eat half of one and a yummy corn cake
FOOD	[ tamale ]	The tamale was a little spicy for my taste, but not bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	The margarita wasn't the most amazing, but also not bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	A good little experience passing thru Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Danger Will Robinson! Avoid this place
FOOD	[ chips, salsa ]	Stale chips, Pace Picante salsa, microwaved food
FOOD	[ chimi ]	I ordered a chimi and the middle was still frozen
FOOD	[ O  ]	Server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	The dining area is extremely shabby: ripped cushions and dingy tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	I do not know why I stayed after the first five minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	DO NOT EAT HERE!  The food is microwaved and tastes like it came out of a box
FOOD	[ tortillas ]	 Yes, they have homemade tortillas, but the stomach ailment you suffer from after visiting here is totally not worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Even the drinks are watered down and the place is full of viejitos
FOOD	[ Buckeye ]	Instead, take a short drive to Cuco's on Buckeye Rd off of Stoughton and ask for Diana
FOOD	[ margaritas, chuck ]	 She makes great margaritas :)This place has the potential to be an adult chuck e
FOOD	[ cheese, beer ]	cheese for happy-hour-nacho-and-beer-aficionados
FOOD	[ O  ]	however, thats not the experience I had
FOOD	[ O  ]	I sat down and immediately wondered what was in store
FOOD	[ burrito ]	What followed (a bland burrito) was both surprising (not in a good way) and disappointing (for the obvious blandness)
FOOD	[ O  ]	In short, the food left much to be desired
FOOD	[ O  ]	I did enjoy the kitschy ambiance but it did not make up for subpar food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Venture into this establishment at your own risk
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love this place!  Was sooooo sad when I found out the Wisc Dells location closed
FOOD	[ chips, salsa, strawberry ]	 So, detoured into Madison on the ride home and still got my fix of yummie fresh hot chips and salsa with a tasty strawberry marg
FOOD	[ Enchiladas, seafood ]	 Onto my fav dish, the Enchiladas seafood suiza, yum
FOOD	[ mexican, date ]	 My fav mexican place to date
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pedro's really only deserves two stars, but more on that later
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	 Don't come to Pedro's in search of authentic Mexican food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But there are some things on the menu that are perfectly fine should you find yourself here for some reason, at a loss as to what to order
FOOD	[ Tex-Mex ]	 I would suggest avoiding most of the menu, which is essentially Tex-Mex T
FOOD	[ cheese ]	dinner-type fare, except with molten cheese-drowned portions that could feed a T-Rex
FOOD	[ carnitas, fajitas, pork, vegetables ]	 I would suggest, instead, the carnitas fajitas: the pork is very tender and flavorful, and the sauteed vegetables are tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not authentic--but perfectly fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They do have a good Tuesday/Thursday margarita special, though the drinks are too sweet for my taste
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I met my S
FOOD	[ O  ]	at Pedro's: hence the extra star
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It will always have a special place in my heart, and I'll keep coming back most Tuesdays for trivia night
FOOD	[ O  ]	Warning: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE! Terrible service! I've had multiple items on the menu, and they've all been below average
FOOD	[ burrito, meat, lettuce, tomato, rice, beans, burrito, steak ]	BTW, if you're looking to have a burrito with the usual items (meat, lettuce, tomato, rice, beans, etc) be prepared to have 1 menu option (The 3 lb burrito) that runs you 13-15 dollars, and MORE if you want grilled steak (of which they will give you 5-7 SMALL pieces)
FOOD	[ Margaritas ]	Margaritas are OK, but be prepared to wait
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	Absolute worst Mexican food I have ever eaten, period
FOOD	[ Mexican, Mexican ]	It's like Mexican food for people who don't like Mexican food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Much of the food had little taste to it
FOOD	[ Taco, Taco ]	I would rather eat Taco Bell, and I don't like Taco Bell
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pedro's was some of the better that I have tasted in Madison
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	 Being from AZ, Mexican food which is "amazing" is hard to find
FOOD	[ salsa, flavor ]	 Their salsa had a good flavor
FOOD	[ tortillas ]	 One thing which was great is their tortillas, fresh made and if dipped in the con queso sauce they are even better!  The service was not amazing, drinks were empty a lot
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	 Overall Pedro's is eatable, if you want authentic Mexican then this is not the place for you
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have to give Pedro's a "good news, bad news" review
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I tried the Camarones wrap -  big mistake
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	 The shrimp were barely warm and slimy
FOOD	[ lettuce, tomatoes ]	 The rest of the filling in the wrap was also unappetizing; shredded lettuce and maybe some tomatoes in a disgusting creamy sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	 After 2 bites I had to give up, I couldn't choke down any more
FOOD	[ O  ]	I give the waiter credit though
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When I complained he offered to bring me something else or take if off the bill with no argument
FOOD	[ Guacamole, avocado ]	 My party ordered the "table" Guacamole, a 2 avocado version mixed to your preference at the table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That was very good
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	So try the table guac, but give the shrimp wrap a pass
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waiter was also truly nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So like I say, good news, bad news
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pedro's is a place that I remember fondly from my childhood
FOOD	[ O  ]	We used to eat there from time-to-time when I was a kid
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sadly, the place hasn't seemed to evolve much since the 80's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We went for an early dinner one night before seeing a show in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We were seated at about 4:30 pm, and were the only ones in the dining room
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The decor is 80's "americanized Mexico
FOOD	[ O  ]	" It looked exactly as I remember it from years ago
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It did seemed to be kept up
FOOD	[ tortillas ]	I was really looking forward to the hot fresh tortillas they used to serve
FOOD	[ tortilla ]	 There is a tortilla maker in the middle of the dining room
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Unfortunately, the machine wasn't running
FOOD	[ tortillas ]	 I can understand that since the place was pretty empty, but the tortillas they gave us were dry and hard
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They had been sitting out for awhile
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That was a bit disappointing
FOOD	[ burrito ]	I had a burrito, it was ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nothing too exciting
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	 In the 80's and 90's it would have been great, but Mexican food in Wisconsin has gotten so much better over the years
FOOD	[ chips, salsa ]	I still love their chips and salsa, though!  However, that probably isn't enough to bring me back again anytime soon
FOOD	[ game ]	Badger game disappointment! Watered down drinks, slow service and rude management! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband and I have watched many badger games at Pedro's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good drink specials and multiple TVs have made this our go to spot for years
FOOD	[ game ]	The service is always slow and the food is just decent but it's a good spot to watch a game
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tonight was a completely different story! My Guinness tasted just like water, I suspect it was watered down
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our service was super slow
FOOD	[ chips, salsa ]	We were there for over 30 minutes before we received chips and salsa
FOOD	[ chips, salt ]	The chips were hot but they needed salt
FOOD	[ salsa, ketchup ]	Their salsa tasted like ketchup
FOOD	[ O  ]	Once we ordered, again our food took forever
FOOD	[ sour cream ]	My cousin asked for sour cream and waited another 20 minutes for it
FOOD	[ O  ]	My food was ok
FOOD	[ tamale ]	The tamale was actually pretty good
FOOD	[ spice ]	It needed spice though
FOOD	[ O  ]	The kicker was when the manager, Brett, started changing the channels shortly after halftime! We asked the waitress what was going on
FOOD	[ game ]	We came for a badger game
FOOD	[ menus ]	Our menus had badger specials, FB also listed their badger specials
FOOD	[ O  ]	Having just received our food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes it took two quarters, we couldn't relocate to another establishment
FOOD	[ O  ]	Apparently, there was a UFC fight on
FOOD	[ O  ]	We asked to speak to management, this is when we met Brett
FOOD	[ game ]	We asked about the game
FOOD	[ game ]	He refused to turn the game back on stating that they paid $2000
FOOD	[ O  ]	00 for the UFC fight and they were going to show it
FOOD	[ base, game ]	I looked around at the sea of red and asked him what his current demographic/ customer base thought of missing the second half of the game
FOOD	[ O  ]	He again referenced the cost
FOOD	[ O  ]	His solution was to have us move tables in the middle of our dinner to be in view of a smaller tv with no sound! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Worst of all was when I told him we wouldn't be returning because of this he said,"Ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	" 
FOOD	[ Margaritas ]	He clearly doesn't care about his customers! Awful!The only thing good about this place is Tuesday and Thursday is half price Margaritas
FOOD	[ chip, salsa, cheese, bean, buffet ]	That and they have a chip, salsa, cheese and bean buffet with that
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was really really good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fast and courteous service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The prices and menu selection was very reasonable
FOOD	[ O  ]	I plan on returning for future visits
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is ok
FOOD	[ Fajitas ]	Fajitas were pretty good
FOOD	[ Enchiladas ]	Enchiladas left much to be desired
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service is ok, kind of slow especially if you have 8 or more people
FOOD	[ chips, salsa ]	Table is served the standard chips and salsa
FOOD	[ tortillas, butter ]	Also served fresh tortillas and butter which I have never seen anywhere else and were very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love hosting large groups here! They are so accommodating, will do separate checks and provide excellent customer service
FOOD	[ bat ]	I've had at least 5 events with parties of 20+ people (sometimes even last minute) and they don't bat an eye
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is pretty good and they have a very large bar selection
FOOD	[ tortillas, shrimp, fajitas ]	The tortillas are fresh and my favorite dish is the shrimp fajitas
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	Pedros is a decent chain for Mexican Resturants, however it comes no where near the good authentic stuff you can have down south!
FOOD	[ chips, salsa, tortillas, butter ]	Starting off with the chips and salsa is always so good, but so filling, by the time my food comes, its all I can do to eat more!  The tortillas are also to die for, a little butter and they are heaven!
FOOD	[ Enchiladas, corn ]	Chick Enchiladas Suiza are the only way to go! I always have a side of corn cakes as they are delicious!Service at the bar was good, food not so good
FOOD	[ mashed potatoes, Mexican ]	 My fault for ordering mashed potatoes at a Mexican restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Entree size very small for the price
FOOD	[ tortillas, chip, salsa, salsa, seafood, burrito, shrimp ]	great fresh tortillas and chip and ask salsa ask for the hot salsa reasonable priced kids menu even better deal on sundays love the seafood burrito with shrimp good enchildas probarly not true authentic mexician but my family has always liked it good place for large groups service is solid we come as much as any sitdown resturant in townWent with a friend who remembered it being good from years ago
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was barely adequate
FOOD	[ Asado, burrito ]	I ordered the $10 Asado burrito
FOOD	[ steak ]	I kid you not there was 8-10 small peices of cut up steak
FOOD	[ O  ]	That was it
FOOD	[ burrito, onion ]	The rest of the burrito was onion
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was so bad I actually got sick and threw it up when I got home
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't believe the ridiculous prices for a small amount of food
FOOD	[ O  ]	I could have made that entire meal for less than $3 at home
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll never go back
FOOD	[ O  ]	And I'll make sure to let all my friends know not to bother going at all
FOOD	[ lights ]	Very Disappointing!Top 3 high/low lights
FOOD	[ O  ]	1) interior is kind of dumpy/old
FOOD	[ O  ]	2) great service
FOOD	[ O  ]	3) average quality food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had dinner at Pedro's on a recent weeknight
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had never been before but have always noticed that the place looks a little dumpy/weathered from the outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sometimes restaurants that don't look like much from the outside can end up being amazing so we decided to give it a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	The inside of the restaurant is also older looking and probably in need of a refresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	However , the place is gigantic and it was nice to be seated right away
FOOD	[ chips, salsa, gluten, tortillas, gluten ]	The service was quick and we were bought a basket of chips and salsa (gluten free!) and a basket of warm flour tortillas (sadly not gluten free)
FOOD	[ mango ]	I had a mango margarita (Pedro's has lots of options for their house margs) which was great
FOOD	[ gluten, Mexican ]	They have a gluten free menu within their standard menu and as with most Mexican restaurants there are lots of g free options
FOOD	[ tacos, corn, tortillas, rice ]	I had tacos in corn tortillas with veggies and rice on the side
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was just ok, not awful but not stellar either
FOOD	[ rice ]	The veggies and rice were luke warm which was disappointing
FOOD	[ fajitas ]	My boyfriend had the fajitas which he said were "just ok" as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wouldn't mind stopping in again if I am in the east side of town but wouldn't go out of my way to come here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I last visited Pedro's in the mid 1990s, so it's been a while since I've swung-in
FOOD	[ O  ]	A large group of us arrived after a show on Friday, April 18
FOOD	[ O  ]	There were 15 of us, and it was 10:45pm
FOOD	[ O  ]	Despite us wandering-in so late, and despite the fact that the crew had mostly cleaned-up for the night (we were the only people there), the staff was *extremely* friendly, accommodating, prompt, and helpful
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ It looks exactly the same as I remember it from back in the day
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Decent tap selection
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ INCREDIBLE tap prices - I got a 32oz mug of Lake Louie for $6
FOOD	[ Cadillac ]	- Cadillac margarita was served warm (despite being on rocks) - not sure how that happened, but it happened twice
FOOD	[ Cadillac ]	- Cadillac margarita delivered a nice headache the next day
FOOD	[ tequila ]	That's unusual, as we normally don't experience one when we have "good" tequila
FOOD	[ tequila, cadillac ]	I'm uncertain what type of tequila they use in the cadillac version, but I suspect it was still closer to "rail"
FOOD	[ chips, salsa ]	+ Good chips and salsa, and they were complimentary, even though we didn't order any other food
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Tons of seating options
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Tables/chairs - looking a little dated and some were quite wobbly
FOOD	[ O  ]	All-in-all, this was a great option for our group, and I couldn't have been any happier than I was with the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was really, really outstanding
FOOD	[ appetizers ]	I'd return for drinks and appetizers again
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	Pedros serves up everything you would want from an Americanized, cheesey Mexican restaraunt
FOOD	[ chips, salsa, burritos, cheese, margaritas ]	They have some over the top mariachi music playing in the dining room, fake parrot cages hanging from the ceiling, free chips and salsa, solid service, gigantic burritos smothered in cheese and a ginormous variety of margaritas
FOOD	[ Mexican, cuisine ]	While I won't venture to say this represents anything close to legitimate Mexican cuisine, it is exactly what the doctor ordered for like 95% of Madisonians
FOOD	[ O  ]	My favorite things about this place:
FOOD	[ tortillas ]	-Fresh tortillas, pressed and warmed in the dining room
FOOD	[ Strawberry ]	-Flavored Margarita variety, because Strawberry should be standard, but blue is something to be applauded
FOOD	[ Corn ]	-Corn cakes - don't waste your sides on anything else, double down on these guys
FOOD	[ O  ]	-Karaoke in the bar with super cheap margarita mugs
FOOD	[ Seafood, olives, enchilada ]	-Seafood Suiza - even with olives (yuck) this is my favorite enchilada anywhere
FOOD	[ Fried Ice Cream ]	-Fried Ice Cream - this place is where it was invented as far as I'm concerned
FOOD	[ tortilla, chips, salsa ]	Pro tip: Don't order off the menu for your kids, a buttered tortilla with crushed up chips and a little salsa is probalby the best thing they have, and its not even on the menu
FOOD	[ til ]	Pretty awesome, don't knock it til you try it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bad service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Waiter was rude and obnoxious
FOOD	[ salsa ]	 We never got refills on drinks or salsa
FOOD	[ menus ]	The menus were sticky
FOOD	[ Fajitas, cheese ]	Fajitas came out w literally one tablespoon of cheese
FOOD	[ O  ]	we live in Wisconsin! !! The chimichangas were on point though
FOOD	[ beans, rice, Mexican ]	Holy hell, what happened to this place?? This had been my go-to place for beans-and-rice Mexican in Madison for the better part of two decades, and I had converted my wife into a Pedro's fan
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	I'd had past or present Madison residents take issue with my insistence that Pedro's was a great casual dinner place, but I took that as part and parcel of Madison's legendary pretentiousness toward anything that's not "edgy," such as old-school Americanized Mexican food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Unfortunately, it turns out any snobbery against Pedro's may be justified
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife and I stopped in for the first time in 3 or 4 years and we were both sorely disappointed with our experience
FOOD	[ burrito, fajitas, dishes ]	The burrito is smaller than it used to be -- I suppose that's how they've been able to hold the line on prices so the size reduction is probably justified -- but my wife's fajitas were chewy, and both dishes lacked that "kick" that they used to have
FOOD	[ appetizer, rock ]	Our quesadilla appetizer arrived luke-warm and was nearly rock-hard within minutes
FOOD	[ age ]	The premises haven't changed in the nearly 20 years I've been eating there and it's starting to show its age
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was adequate, no more no less
FOOD	[ O  ]	which would be fine if everything else up to par
FOOD	[ O  ]	 In short, Pedro's lacks that extra spark that used to make it worth a special stop when visiting or passing through town
FOOD	[ Mexican, cuisine, game ]	Not to mention the Mexican cuisine options have exploded in Madison in the last 20 years, so one would think Pedro's would need to step up their game rather than rest on their laurels
FOOD	[ O  ]	Looks like we'll be checking out the newer competitors on our next visit to Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Standard family diner
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing surprising here
FOOD	[ O  ]	A decent place to stop for breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh
FOOD	[ O  ]	My
FOOD	[ O  ]	God
FOOD	[ O  ]	One would think that any restaurant in America's Dairyland, especially a chain restaurant that has been around for decades, could serve breakfast without screwing it up
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our family of three ordered breakfast for dinner tonight and this Perkins disappointed the heck out of us
FOOD	[ steak, eggs, steak, eggs ]	One order was steak and eggs: the steak was supposed to be medium and the eggs over hard
FOOD	[ steak, eggs ]	What came to the table was a bloody, raw steak -- not rare, mind you, but raw -- and eggs with a translucent, inedible crust around the outer edge
FOOD	[ scrambled eggs, biscuits, gravy ]	Some of that crust ended up in one of the other orders, which was scrambled eggs with biscuits and gravy
FOOD	[ scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs ]	One does not expect the possibility of breaking a tooth when eating scrambled eggs, but not one, not two, but three two-inch long pieces of that translucent crust ended up in the folded, dry "scrambled eggs
FOOD	[ scrambled eggs ]	Another order of scrambled eggs -- mine -- had a long, thin, hair-like thread of indeterminate origin
FOOD	[ string ]	Was it the same substance as the translucent crust? Was it a string from a hairnet? Was it a human hair? When I pulled it from my mouth, it split in two and curled up like elastic might curl up
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our server was appropriately apologetic and tried to make things okay -- the service was good, but the food was absolutely horrid!
FOOD	[ O  ]	The manager asked us how our dinner was when we went to pay, so we told her
FOOD	[ O  ]	She took 20% off of our bill but, truly, the food we ate was overpriced at any discount
FOOD	[ O  ]	If we all hadn't been so darn hungry and tired, we'd have left without eating
FOOD	[ eggs ]	And if I had it to do over, I would have insisted we all leave after finding the inedible translucent hard gluey stuff in the eggs and find somewhere else to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	Do NOT repeat our mistake
FOOD	[ O  ]	AVOID this restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Try the IHOP down the road if you want breakfast
FOOD	[ steak ]	Go across the interstate to Texas Roadhouse if you want a steak
FOOD	[ O  ]	Go hungry if you must, just don't eat here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Please
FOOD	[ O  ]	Was staying at the comfort inn next to Perkins and the clerk told me they gave 10% off for guests
FOOD	[ O  ]	I figure I'd get a late night burger and I wasn't disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	I called and ordered
FOOD	[ grill ]	It was coming off the grill in the time it took me to walk over
FOOD	[ O  ]	Burger was good and staff was friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife introduced me to Perkins just this year and every time we've driven through 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wisconsin, we've stopped at a Perkins
FOOD	[ O  ]	This was the 3rd Perkins that I've been to and have enjoyed the food and service every time
FOOD	[ bacon ]	We both ordered pancakes with a side of bacon
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was very good and the service was even better
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife commented that either Perkins manages to hire the friendliest people or they have excellent training
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is so below average
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant decor is out dated and worn out
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Poor service below average breakfast and how do you even screw up breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Manager asked how was everything I said "just ok"he said ok did not inquire
FOOD	[ flavor ]	Food did not have quality flavor it was very bland
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pretty good breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good service - I didn't wait at all to be seated or to receive my food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I really like the food came exactly as I ordered it
FOOD	[ pie ]	Well, The pie is good
FOOD	[ coffee ]	The coffee is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restroom was gross
FOOD	[ O  ]	But they did have lots of parking
FOOD	[ O  ]	My breakfast was 75% correct
FOOD	[ O  ]	As the Yelp 2 Star rating says: Meh
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've experienced better
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not so good
FOOD	[ Eggs, hash browns ]	Eggs were overcooked, I could not chew the whites, and the hash browns were burned on the outside and raw inside
FOOD	[ O  ]	Come here for desserts only, not breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was excellent and friendly and the restaurant was clean
FOOD	[ eggs, hash browns ]	Prices were quite high, three eggs and hash browns was $14
FOOD	[ coffee ]	00 with coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	Note:  This review is location-sensitive
FOOD	[ O  ]	I called the wrong location (Sun Prairie) when I needed delivery to east Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	To THEIR credit, the girl there was incredibly nice and gave me the new number of the east side location
FOOD	[ O  ]	Rude employee, Bad food, Bad service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Will never order from them again
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, when I called the Commercial Street location, a gentleman answered, with incredibly loud music in the background causing me to barely understand the questions I expected
FOOD	[ O  ]	He asked for the necessary delivery info and what I wanted
FOOD	[ O  ]	I asked him which would be easier for him, the numbers or titles of what I wanted (given that I looked online prior to calling) and he replied with 'whatever, no both'
FOOD	[ O  ]	I started my order and he corrected me rudely telling me I wasn't referring to the correct numbers, that they belonged to another store (there's only one website)
FOOD	[ hung ]	After taking my order, he took my card number, said it would be 45 minutes, and hung up
FOOD	[ Crab, Chicken, Fried Rice, Pork, Egg Roll, General Tso's Chicken, chicken, rice, dough, crab, green onions, cookie ]	The delivery man was very cordial, however, the food was the worst Chinese I've ever had (Order: Crab Rangoon, Chicken Fried Rice, Pork Egg Roll, General Tso's Chicken) - the chicken and rice was dry, the general tso's was mostly fried dough, the crab rangoon had overpowering green onions and the fortune cookie stale
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone
FOOD	[ Chang ]	Was not feeling well yesterday so I ordered some food online for delivery from Chang Jiang
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Originally I though I had enough cash to pay for the order but realized as I was finishing my online order I'd have to pay by credit card
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I took the $23 and threw on the table next to the door so I could tip in cash
FOOD	[ feet ]	When the guy delivered,BTW he was in my neighbors driveway about 2 feet into his lawn, I grabbed what I though was a $3 tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Woke up this morning and realized that I had given him $23 instead of 3
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I forgot to remove the $20 bill when I handed him the cash
FOOD	[ O  ]	I didn't look at it, like I said, I was sick
FOOD	[ conversation ]	 I called this morning to and began the conversation with him like this " Hi, you delivered food to me yesterday on ____ St
FOOD	[ O  ]	and I think I may have mistakenly given you too much for the tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He started yelling in to the phone that I gave him a $3 tip not a $23 dollar tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He was ranting and raving
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The weird part is that I had not even said the amount I though I had mistakingly tipped him
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was talking calmly and he was ranting that I also had stolen his pen from him(a 20 cent pen!)  
FOOD	[ O  ]	Why would someone react like that to a simple inquiry??I was not accusatory, I was simply inquiring
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And then for him to say he wanted to come over and pick up the pen I had taken from him? WTF?  
FOOD	[ Karma ]	Ever heard of Karma dude?Solid option
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I live on the east side and delivery is limited
FOOD	[ Chang ]	 Chang Jiang is not the greatest place out there, but it is decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have online ordering or over the phone
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They deliver in blizzards and on Sundays
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They also regularly send out coupons
FOOD	[ appetizers, crab, egg rolls, soup ]	They have a huge menu!  Their appetizers are lacking, there are only about 8 options which include the usual crab rangoon, egg rolls and soup
FOOD	[ chicken, chicken ]	I generally order their orange chicken or their General Tsao's chicken
FOOD	[ fried rice ]	 All of their meals come with fried rice (unless otherwise noted) or you can substitute
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I love my food VERY spicy and they always amp it up when I request that
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They make it exactly how I like it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall flavors are decent
FOOD	[ meat ]	 They sauce can sometimes be overpowering to the point where you can not tell the different between veggies and meat in your container
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The portions are inconsistent
FOOD	[ containers ]	 They had switched containers for awhile and portions got smaller
FOOD	[ containers ]	 Then all of a sudden we are back to big containers!  It is not a big deal, I still got a ton of food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Basically this is a typical/standard Chinese food place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wow, this place is so hit or miss
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm honestly just not sure what I'll be getting for delivery each time I order (the same thing)
FOOD	[ O  ]	They must have a different person cooking the stuff every single time because nothing ever comes to me the same as the last
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have had some great General Tso's here, and I have had some horrible way too spicy un eatable Tso's here
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's just so confusing
FOOD	[ O  ]	I enjoy the lunch special the best
FOOD	[ O  ]	Most lunch specials are around $4
FOOD	[ fried rice, egg roll ]	99 and come with fried rice (or white/just ask) and a egg roll
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great! It's enough food for a second meal for most
FOOD	[ beat ]	Who can beat that? Pretty much anything and everything is offered under this lunch special as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	What a deal!
FOOD	[ egg rolls ]	Great egg rolls, Very good Rangoon! Awesome soups! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yet
FOOD	[ O  ]	like I said, you can't expect the same dish every time
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a surprise to what quality of food will end up in front of you
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pretty quick delivery (usually around 25-30 minutes)
FOOD	[ sesame, chicken, chicken, beef, broccoli ]	Good sesame chicken, orange chicken, beef and broccoli
FOOD	[ Cracker, Barrel ]	First off- as an 11-year Madison resident, I ate at Cracker Barrel for the very first time (here) last weekend
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We met friends from out of town, and overall it was pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The staff had no problem pulling together two tables for the 7 of us, and service was both prompt and correct
FOOD	[ O  ]	 CB serves breakfast all day, and what a breakfast it is!  Portions were fair, not huge, and the price was right
FOOD	[ Bacon, eggs, biscuits, grits ]	 Bacon, eggs, biscuits and grits- yum
FOOD	[ sausage, gravy, gelatinous, bowl ]	 My only gripe was that the sausage gravy was gelatinous and plopped out of the bowl instead of pouring
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That was kind of gross
FOOD	[ O  ]	CB clearly caters to insterstate travelers, and it does this well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You can also find some interesting items in their huge "country store", from cutesy mugs and figurines to sweatshirts for Gramps and Easter dresses for the young'uns
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is good, can be bland at times, but still pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service is top notch and will try to seat big groups as fast as they can
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place fills up fast on weekend for breakfast so come early
FOOD	[ cracker, barrel ]	I've been to cracker barrel twice
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was ok, I agree with Thomas that the food can be bland
FOOD	[ conversation ]	Warning-if its busy don't expect to be able to carry on a conversation very easily
FOOD	[ Cracker, Barrel ]	Can be really loudIt had been quite a while since we ate at a Cracker Barrel
FOOD	[ O  ]	We stopped there when shopping at East Towne Mall
FOOD	[ pot roast, chicken ]	I ordered the pot roast and my husband ordered chicken and dumplilngs
FOOD	[ salt ]	Yuck! It had more salt than you'd find in food at McDonalds
FOOD	[ meat, pot roast ]	The meat in the pot roast tasted processed
FOOD	[ dumplings ]	The dumplings were slimy
FOOD	[ vegetables ]	The vegetables were so salty, they were inedible
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pros: The shop is very cute
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cons: Don't eat the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am sorry to hear about the bad food some people had here because we have never had a bad meal here
FOOD	[ O  ]	(update, just had a bad meal here
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	 The shrimp dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	  one of the worst I have ever had
FOOD	[ fish, shrimp, popcorn, shrimp ]	 They do fish so well but their shrimp was over breaded popcorn shrimp that did not have that country specialness that you expect from CB
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The hushpuppies were also dry and flavorless
FOOD	[ trout, steak ]	)   I have had very good trout and also a very well done steak
FOOD	[ beat ]	  It fits into a narrow country recipe selection but when you are in the mood for that you can't beat the price and the quality of food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service has always been good, the environment is pleasant and there is plenty of room
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The bathrooms are very clean
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The gift shop has something for everyone
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We almost always find something and they don't particularly cater to out taste
FOOD	[ candy ]	  In the midst of country craft, bible baubles and kitchen kitch (is there such a thing?)  we have found some nice decorative items, ornaments, candy, and other gifts
FOOD	[ egg ]	Found a hair in an egg and they immediately remade the entire meal and the manager came out to speak with us
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Good and appropriate recovery
FOOD	[ O  ]	  My pancakes this time around were not as flavorful as the last
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They were still good
FOOD	[ O  ]	On a cold winter day get a seat near the fireplace and have a nice home cooked meal
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 The coffee has always been good too
FOOD	[ O  ]	  It isn't fancy stuff but still good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Folks here are almost always very pleasant and talkative
FOOD	[ French Toast ]	Update: The French Toast was nothing special
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Third meal I have had here that I didn't care for much
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Avoid it
FOOD	[ Ham, sausage ]	 Ham was so-so as was the smoked sausage
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not a good breakfast for me
FOOD	[ Coffee ]	  Coffee wasn't good this time either
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Staff continues to be great
FOOD	[ dishes ]	I would suggest the management review all their dishes and step them up a notch
FOOD	[ O  ]	  The meals are underpriced
FOOD	[ dishes ]	  Maybe this is leading to less quality dishes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Stop this
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Raise the prices and improve the quality
FOOD	[ Cracker, Barrel ]	I am writing this review as a big advocate of Cracker Barrel in general
FOOD	[ O  ]	Every city I travel, I know I wont be disappointed
FOOD	[ casserole ]	Not to sound like a broken record, but my favorite is the Grandpas breakfast with hash brown casserole
FOOD	[ apple, dessert, apples, apple ]	I decided to get the apple dumpling dessert here and to my big surprise, they do not peel the apples here in the apple dumpling
FOOD	[ Cracker, apples ]	Call it picky, but other two previous Cracker Barrels that I have gone to, they peel the apples
FOOD	[ O  ]	It tastes much better and when i told the waitress that, she simply shrugged it off
FOOD	[ berry, dessert, bowl ]	When my friend also complained that his berry dessert was only half of what it should be (completely deflated and only half the bowl), she didn't offer to take it back or anything, just kind of laughed it off
FOOD	[ etiquette ]	Most likely, we probably wouldn't have sent our food back simply because I use to work in the food industry, but I know its just simple etiquette to at least offer
FOOD	[ Cracker ]	Nevertheless, I will still continue to go to Cracker Barrels no matter what
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food at a GREAT price
FOOD	[ O  ]	I nicknamed my "lunch special" the "recession plate," as my portion was significantly smaller than my table mates
FOOD	[ fatty ]	The food was okay, just kind of fatty
FOOD	[ corn, muffins, butter, butter ]	The corn muffins had so much butter it was nauseating - and i love butter
FOOD	[ chocolate ]	The only thing that saved this place was the chocolate bar i purchased in the store area
FOOD	[ O  ]	That shit was good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really like CB for a good breakfast meal
FOOD	[ Pancake ]	I still think the Original Pancake House trumps them
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are in a league of their own but the CB does provide good quality and breakfast for a excellent price
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can feed a family of 5 and everyone be full for a great price
FOOD	[ pork, bacon, sausage ]	Being someone who doesn't  eat pork and this being a breakfast country restaurant, I am very pleased that they have turkey products like bacon and sausage
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu is very large as they have  two, one for breakfast and the other for lunch/dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service has always been good when I've dined there and the staff has good knowledge of the menu
FOOD	[ gourmet ]	I reserve 4 and 5 stars for upscale and gourmet restaurants but is give the CB a solid 3 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious food (their burgers are seriously the best fast-food burgers)! The service here is fine, the prices are a bit high, and this location is nice and quiet
FOOD	[ fast food ]	All-in-all, an okay place, especially considering it's fast food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hardee's in Madison is kind of a tradition for my family whenever we drive through town
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We do not have a Hardee's where we live so it is kind of a treat for us
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Simply put, the food is better than Mc Donalds and the deals are comparable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service is not quite as quick but your food is fresher when you get it
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's pretty good, but it is expensive
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Think Culver's prices
FOOD	[ fast food ]	Really great value! Best fast food burgers in town, better than culvers
FOOD	[ bucks ]	Went on a Thursday and thick burger combo was $6 bucks with tax! Burger was big tasty and messy
FOOD	[ Fries ]	Fries we're hot and seasoned nicely
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If your thinking red robin burger without the sit down price tag, come here and you'll be pleasantly surprised :)I stopped here on the way to my hometown from the airport one of the last times I was in the Madison area
FOOD	[ Melt ]	I'm normally a huge fan of the Wisconsin Swiss Melt, but the one I had here was not so good
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	First, the sandwich was exceptionally greasy
FOOD	[ patty, melt, sandwich ]	I don't think I've ever had a patty melt-type sandwich that was that greasy in my life
FOOD	[ butter ]	Yeah, I understand this is a joint that specializes in butter burgers, but this was extreme, even for Culver's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Second, the size of the burger was pathetic
FOOD	[ patty, sandwich, bread ]	Admittedly, I've been out of Wisconsin for a few years now, so maybe my recollection of the size of Culver's burgers isn't so good, but the patty on this particular sandwich was seriously thin, and the burger came no where close to covering the bread
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're just passing through the north side of Madison and have a sudden craving for Culver's, I'd suggest you keep going and stop at the location in Waunakee or the location near East Towne Mall, depending upon which direction you're heading
FOOD	[ O  ]	This Culvers gives Culvers a bad name
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	Ive had excessively slow service, hair in my ice cream and burgers that resemble dog food and that's enough for me
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ive never quite seen a burger paddy so thin and greasy before in my life
FOOD	[ O  ]	You've  got to be desperate to eat there
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bastard child of two sexy Culvers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grade: C
FOOD	[ O  ]	Chain food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Okay service
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't explain why I don't hate this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	For a chain this place is great
FOOD	[ chips, salsa ]	The chips and salsa is AOK
FOOD	[ Bean ]	The Bean burger is better than a lot of other places
FOOD	[ brownie ]	and the desserts are good too (the blondie brownie)
FOOD	[ O  ]	the servers are kinda rude and uninformed though
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our waiter was very friendly, he had a southern accent
FOOD	[ O  ]	I could not tell if he was a high school kid or college kid but he was very friendly and provided great service
FOOD	[ soup, salad ]	I had the lunch special - half soup and half salad
FOOD	[ soup, chili ]	For soup I had the chili- it was way too soupy
FOOD	[ beans, meat ]	Come on, pack the protein, more beans and more meat please!
FOOD	[ salad ]	The cobb salad was not bad
FOOD	[ avocado ]	The avocado dressing that came with it was delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	And $7 for that? Oh yeah
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Ask for Waitress Aimee ~ she was friendly and professional
FOOD	[ O  ]	Stopped for an early dinner with my wife,she wanted to try the two for twenty special
FOOD	[ O  ]	As soon as we told the server what we wanted the service went downhill
FOOD	[ alcohol ]	We did not order any alcohol and we were having the special so this was not going to be a big check for the server but restaruant was not busy so any check should be better than no check
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Used the kiosk to pay for meal since i couldn't get the server to come back to check on us
FOOD	[ O  ]	Discount did not show up on kiosk I shouls have been  more aware since i had heard a similar comment from another table when we came in
FOOD	[ O  ]	Server said not to worry that the amount was correct
FOOD	[ O  ]	I pushed for reciept showing what was actually being charged to ny card
FOOD	[ O  ]	server said she needed my card and would have to talk to the manager
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finally got my paper reciept with correct charges but kiosk on table showed the over charge and had not adjusted
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife thought we were going to be billed twice for the same meal, so she has been watching the debit card account
FOOD	[ O  ]	This incident killed my night and the weekend with my wife constantly checking the bank account
FOOD	[ O  ]	This incident is all that my has been talking about to her friends all weekend long, I am sure that this will continue once she gets to work tomorrow
FOOD	[ chili, steak, fajitas ]	Ordered a cup of the chili and the steak fajitas
FOOD	[ Chili ]	 The quality was consistent with other Chili's I've eaten at in the past
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nothing spectacular but then nothing terrible either
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere is typical of the chain, and kept clean enough
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only downside was the waiter
FOOD	[ beans, rice ]	 He messed up the drink order by bringing a Corona instead of the Blue Moon and included the up sell beans and rice, which I had told him I didn't want at time of order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Both mistakes seemed to be intended to get the ticket price up to increase his tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a national chain so you pretty much get what you'd expect
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have never had problems with the service and the food is always good
FOOD	[ salad ]	Had the Santa Fe salad
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Man, was it good!I do a lot of shopping at Copps because 1) it's close and 2) I usually frequent Copps as a change of pace from the smaller markets and co-ops
FOOD	[ coffee, salad ]	As far as large chain grocery stores go, Copps has a wide selection in pretty much every food category, including a coffee stand, bakery, butcher, salad bar, and deli (whose workers are the most surly you've probably ever encountered)
FOOD	[ cheese, liquor ]	There's a selection of organic foods that is decent for a chain grocery, a good cheese aisle, and a well-stocked liquor section
FOOD	[ O  ]	Copps has weekly sales from time to time, often on its own line of products, but prices in general tend to be middle of the road or higher for your usual goods
FOOD	[ O  ]	Be sure to get a Copps card (its free) to take advantage of the sales
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you have a chance, I've noticed the Copps on University on the westside is *much* more posh and has a better selection and display of its items, particularly the service counters (deli, bakery, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	Having visited this Shopko location after encountering the westside Copps made things look a little bit drearier
FOOD	[ O  ]	THANK GOD! I am sick of co-ops
FOOD	[ O  ]	One shop for everything food
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like plastic bags and large carbon footprints
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not going to martyr myself and pay more for a smaller selection for some pinko environmentalist agenda
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a Copps
FOOD	[ frozen food ]	They generally have higher prices than I'd like, and I find their image-signs in the frozen food completely counter-intuitive, but it's clean, the food is decently fresh, and if we're in the area we'll stop in for a thing or two, but we won't go out of our way to go here
FOOD	[ O  ]	We'd much rather go to HyVee
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is so-so
FOOD	[ O  ]	No one outstandingly friendly, and no one outstandingly rude
FOOD	[ O  ]	We have been shopping at this location since we moved into the neighborhood this past year
FOOD	[ O  ]	Copp's (the past year or two) has really gone down hill
FOOD	[ O  ]	We normally do our big shopping at Woodman's because it's cheaper
FOOD	[ O  ]	We'd go to this Copp's more but 1, the prices are higher MUCH higher than almost any place in Madison
FOOD	[ stock ]	Also they have a horrible time having things in stock
FOOD	[ O  ]	A lot of shelves are barely stocked (during the week even) and the signs in the frozen area are dumb, having lame pictures isn't helping me find products
FOOD	[ stock, stock ]	If they updated a few things, had more things in stock and even regular items in stock I'd give a better rating
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also the parking lot is pretty dim/dark
FOOD	[ O  ]	Makes me feel unsafe
FOOD	[ O  ]	Again
FOOD	[ O  ]	not a fan of Copps, in general
FOOD	[ O  ]	This one seems a bit older and a bit more in need of a facelift, but it's not bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wide aisles, plenty of check outs, and decent produce
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices are typically higher than Woodman's, but Copps allows the use of credit cards (or using your debit card as a credit card, which I do because my bank gives me 5% cashback when I do)
FOOD	[ chocolate ]	Bakery items are usually stellar - especially the chocolate donuts
FOOD	[ O  ]	;-)Cozy place with good fried food and super cheap booze
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I expected some attitude from the locals when stopping in here before a party nearby and got none--partly because we were the only folks there but also the bartender was nice as could be
FOOD	[ O  ]	Perhaps some day I'll go back and point out the inconsistent apostrophe position in their signage and get punched in the face
FOOD	[ O  ]	A friendly locals' dive bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't expect much, however, it's a nice enough place if you need to whet your whistle out yonder
FOOD	[ event ]	Due to the third annual Schizophrenia hardcore/gabber event, my friend Aaron and I found ourselves on the outskirts of Madison and in need of whiskey
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Luckily the warehouse we were destined for was by Slices' (Slice's/Slices)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Boy, oh boy, factory bars in Wisconsin pour stiff drinks!Drinks are stiff, and the bartender is awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I lived in this town for 26 years and didn't know this place existed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Come in and ask for Justin, he'll treat you right
FOOD	[ Tom Collins ]	 He makes a mad decent Tom Collins
FOOD	[ sausage, sandwich, corn ]	The summer sausage sandwich is a pure Sconnie experience and paired with the mini corn dogs is the bees' knees
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sound system is nice and the jukebox is deep if that matters to you
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bar is now called Slice's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bullit is gone (thank god)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great friendly service, great food and the owner is cute as a button
FOOD	[ O  ]	Justin no longer works there but Kimmy and Brian will treat you right
FOOD	[ O  ]	There mixology is beyond reproach
FOOD	[ fish ]	Great fish fry and even better burgers
FOOD	[ chicken, teriyaki ]	Good quality chicken teriyaki in the mall
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very affordable and huge portionNom nom nom
FOOD	[ teriyaki ]	Yummy teriyaki and big portions
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of the few places to get nearly-fresh 'fast' food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Once, when I was a kid, I was reading a book at recess because I was a big nerd and that's how I rolled
FOOD	[ O  ]	This kid in my school, his name was Weston, came up behind me and, without warning, kicked me in the crotch as hard as he could
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was the kind of kick where I didn't see it coming
FOOD	[ O  ]	 His foot caught me right in the jewel-box and lifted me a good six inches off the ground
FOOD	[ body ]	 I felt everything go weak in my body
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I crumpled to the ground clutching my boys and screaming
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I cried like a little baby
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You would have, too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Weston ran off--I didn't find out he was the one who did it until days later
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When the playground teacher walked over to find out what was wrong with me, I couldn't even talk to tell her what had happened
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I thew up from the pain
FOOD	[ feet ]	When I could finally function again, I discovered my book had scattered a few feet out in front of me and landed in a puddle
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was ruined
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And I had brought that book from home
FOOD	[ O  ]	For weeks, nay MONTHS, after that, the other boys in my class thought it was so funny that I got nut-rocked like I did, that they spent most of their free moments trying to find ways to replicate it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When I walked through the halls, I had to constantly look over my shoulder, lest I find a foot planted in my nards
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When I was at recess, I had to stand with my back to the wall at all times, lest someone attempt to crotch-punt me across the playground again
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was miserable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I had started out first grade loving school
FOOD	[ O  ]	 After that day, I never once liked school again
FOOD	[ chicken, teriyaki, event ]	Sarku Japan's chicken teriyaki is so good, that when I eat it, for a few blessed seconds, I forget the trauma of that event
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grade: C-
FOOD	[ O  ]	I hate Applebee's
FOOD	[ diet ]	It only tasted good because I'm on a diet
FOOD	[ O  ]	The epitome of a crap chain
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Why did I get talked into going here?  Because I am a tool
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Crowded, loud, mediocre food, slow service, and on this particular occasion a strange man two tables down and across the aisle staring at me and not his dining companion, during the entire meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I should have just yelled, "watch my head spin" and vomited there at the table
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's an Applebee's
FOOD	[ O  ]	what do you expect?  Every Applebee's I've ever been to has sticky tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	must be something in how they are made or cleaned
FOOD	[ glass ]	 The shot glass desserts aren't bad, but if you go here, you know what you are getting in to
FOOD	[ O  ]	My folks love this place and I can't imagine why
FOOD	[ chicken, candle ]	 I had the chicken wrap and it could not hold a candle to the wraps at the Great Dane
FOOD	[ fries, glass ]	The fries are so overly seasoned they are almost impossible to eat without a huge glass of water
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Don't go there
FOOD	[ O  ]	This needs no explanation
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service has always been excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	usually i go there just by myself but sever always pays a lot of attention to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am not a big fan of their steaks - i think they are not tender enough and a bit chewy
FOOD	[ parmesan, shrimp, pasta ]	but the rest of the menu is amazing! try parmesan shrimp or their pasta bowls
FOOD	[ appetizer, garlic, potatoes, sour cream ]	2 for 20$ including an appetizer - who doesn't love that? thei garlic mashd potatoes loaded with sour cream are very good too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Always good service, never much of a wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Other than that, it's Applebee's
FOOD	[ O  ]	you should already know what to expect
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was great and quick
FOOD	[ Melissa ]	Our drinks arrived quick and our server Melissa had honest and accurate suggestions
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She was really friendly and fun!  Only problem was that it was really cold because of the air conditioning
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Otherwise it was a great experience!The service was great, I love my server!TERRIBLE!!!!!!
FOOD	[ choice ]	I have been in the state for 4 months and this is the WORST restaurant choice we have made so far
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had a bad feeling and should have listened to my instinct
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wasted $40
FOOD	[ O  ]	Let me start by saying the host/hostess were the nicest staff at the place
FOOD	[ sirloin, mashed potatoes ]	My husband ordered the 7 oz sirloin with riblets, seasonal vegatables and mashed potatoes
FOOD	[ sirloin ]	The sirloin was mostly fat and rubbery
FOOD	[ meat ]	There was no meat to be eaten
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was just a hunk of fat
FOOD	[ flavor, cigarette ]	The riblets even had a weird smoke flavor that he compared to cigarette smoke
FOOD	[ O  ]	We do not go places looking for an all smiles server, but this guy did not smile and when he saw we were not enjoying our meal and my husband's plate was still full, he did not even ask if the food was okay or if there was something he could do
FOOD	[ O  ]	We don't like to complain and just were not in the mood to even let him or the manager know
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really did not expect the food to be so bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will stick to TGIFridays, Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse from now on;they never disappoint and we have no problem putting down $50 or $60 plus a $10+ tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	For the same $40 spent, we could have gotten a meal we actually enjoyed
FOOD	[ chicken, fries ]	The only good part was my daughter's chicken fingers, fries and pepsi
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sad
FOOD	[ O  ]	We will not be returning
FOOD	[ O  ]	For such a nice "looking" exterior, you would think they'd have more quality food and servers
FOOD	[ O  ]	I guess you get what you pay for
FOOD	[ O  ]	sadly
FOOD	[ O  ]	Do not go here! We will be voiding it like the plague
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food was good
FOOD	[ Berry, Sangria ]	A little disappointed in my Berry Sangria
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wish it looked and tasted as good as the picture
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing stood out to me tho
FOOD	[ cheese sticks ]	I might go back for their cheese sticks tho:)Last time I went I was very disappointed in the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had a large group so I can understand it taking a little longer than normal but our server took forever to ask us what we wanted to drink (we were a little later than the rest of the party who already had a drink)
FOOD	[ game ]	Also all the TVs were on a preface channel while there was another game that was actually on
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't think I'd ever pick to go there again
FOOD	[ O  ]	Will only go if someone else wants to
FOOD	[ O  ]	We like it here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The two of us went in today for lunch and there was a short wait (15 minutes) so we decided to grab our drinks at the bar while we waited
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The Bartender was visually a bit flustered as there were three unsavory looking and sounding women seemingly trying his patience with their drinks and menu ordering
FOOD	[ Cadillac, glass, Cow ]	When her got to use I ordered a Cadillac Margarita on the Rocks in the Big glass and he got a tall Spotted Cow on tap
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I continued to be friendly to the Bartender as I know the type and he was tipped $3 for the drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	 While we got down off our bar stools he did say 'thank you, enjoy your meals
FOOD	[ mozzarella, appetizer ]	Our waitress was Tasha and she was very pleasant; we ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and chatted in between watching basketball and Men's gymnastics on one of their many TV's
FOOD	[ bacon, cheeseburger, cheese ]	  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with the works (hold the cheese) and he ordered two (2) trios; one for now and one for later
FOOD	[ fries ]	The food was good, but the fries were sparse and non-crispy while they were seasoned OK
FOOD	[ Cow ]	 He had another Spotted Cow and we cashed out
FOOD	[ O  ]	All in all another nice afternoon at Applebee's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Let me preface this by saying that I'm usually a Burger King guy (I like their mascot better, McDonald's is too funny looking)
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, my friend was in town, and I thought, "why the heck not? live a little!" so I brought her here
FOOD	[ O  ]	On our way to McDonald's, also known as "Mickey D's" in other areas, I begin to worry that maybe I should have called to reserve a table in advance
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, upon arriving, we were pleasantly surprised to find no line!! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	We did wait a minute or two to be seated, but apparently, this is one of those seat yourself places
FOOD	[ O  ]	As I approached the front, I was immediately mesmerized by their huge selection of burgers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their menu ranged from McSingles to McDoubles to even McTriples!! They also had a dollar menu consisting of items costing $1
FOOD	[ O  ]	07 after tax
FOOD	[ Chicken ]	I decided to go with their house special, The Big Mac, and their seasonal Chicken "McNugget" Pieces
FOOD	[ chicken ]	When I opened up my box of chicken nuggets, the pale-golden/yellow skin indicated that it had just came out of the storage unit next to the fryer
FOOD	[ meat ]	As the freshness evaporated with every bite, I really began to taste all the other kinds of meat that went into making the nuggets
FOOD	[ pork ]	I think I even tasted some pork, but don't take my word for it
FOOD	[ dipping sauces, containers, blend ]	Oh my God and then you have the dipping sauces! These little containers held the perfect blend of artificial sweetener and manufactured taste  
FOOD	[ O  ]	As I eagerly unwrapped my Big Mac, I was slightly disappointed to find that it wasn't as advertised (the picture on the display made it seem a lot bigger!!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh well
FOOD	[ chef ]	I would really like to commend the chef on making the buns just how I like them, extremely soggy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was even more impressed that the soggy, limp buns were able to maintain their round form
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is some pretty advanced cooking technique!!
FOOD	[ mayo ]	Anyways, as I bit into my Big Mac, the first thing I tasted was the mayo
FOOD	[ mayo ]	Actually, it was the only thing I tasted, but it was some damn good mayo
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finally, if you're watching your waistline, they have a plethora of drink options
FOOD	[ Diet, Diet, Sugar, Diet ]	Choices like Diet Coke, Diet Coke Zero, Sugar-free Diet Coke Zero, etc
FOOD	[ diet ]	ensures that there's a perfect diet drink for everyone
FOOD	[ date ]	PS: Perfect date spot for Valentine's Day
FOOD	[ O  ]	Highly recommended!!I broke down and was craving McDonald's and wanted to check out the newly built one
FOOD	[ bacon ]	Ordered the new bacon clubhouse burger
FOOD	[ cooler ]	It was tasty but on the cooler side of hot
FOOD	[ fries ]	Once again though fries as bad as you can get
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cold, dried out and down right uneatable
FOOD	[ O  ]	I do like that they have coke zero even as it wasn't mixed properly
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service, what service
FOOD	[ O  ]	No warm welcome or even a smile and it was a manager who was besides himself for having to leave his set position to help me the only customer at noon in line
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dining room looks great new
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dirty as all hell
FOOD	[ O  ]	Looked to sit at 3 high tables and all the seats had greasy soda spots all over them
FOOD	[ O  ]	How hard is it to manage a place like this
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've done it quiet successfully for many years
FOOD	[ O  ]	And yes someone can contact me if they'd like
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am 95% sure I acquired a nasty food based illness here
FOOD	[ chicken ]	I ate some of the chicken nuggets, and within 2 hours I was terribly ill, vomiting the entire contents of my stomach into my kitchen sink because I was not able to get to the bathroom
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was that bad
FOOD	[ hygiene ]	As for the service, the 'help' if you can call it that clearly did not want to be working at the place, and I observed several questionable hygiene related issues in regards to how the staff handled themselves - and the food
FOOD	[ Hamburger, chicken, potato ]	How was I able to do this, you ask? Well good reader, the reason is that I was standing for 10 minutes at the counter waiting for my order, a Hamburger, a single order of chicken nuggets, a baked potato, and a large soft drink
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had ample time to observe these things
FOOD	[ fast food, feet ]	I know only the most 'interesting' person would actually enjoy working at a fast food place, but the help here set a new bar of horribleness - if the bar was buried 3 feet into the ground that is
FOOD	[ fast food ]	Add in the for lack of a better term - 'wiped out' dining room which was filthy, and you get fast food hell
FOOD	[ O  ]	Avoid at all costs - go to another Wendy's - any other Wendy's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't even want to give this place any stars
FOOD	[ chunk ]	I found a chunk of tin foil in my burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	I took it up to get a new one and the person didn't say one word to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	No sorry no nothing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just took the burger, made me a new one and gave it back
FOOD	[ O  ]	without saying one word to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	Customer service is absolutely terrible which is a shame because the food is usually good there
FOOD	[ beef, fish, beef, meat, flavor ]	Not sure what happened to the beef at Wendy's, BUT I have been to this location and the fish hatchery location and the newer thicker beef patties have a strange old meat flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not sure when or if I will go back
FOOD	[ O  ]	This used to be a favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wish they would go back to the old style of burgers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Speedy, friendly service, rarely messes up my order, even if it is complicated, which it usually is
FOOD	[ O  ]	Late night staff get swamped regularly, but handle it well
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great vegetarian and vegan options
FOOD	[ fast food ]	(I feel I need to say that my five stars is versus other fast food restaurants, but for the money it definitely still holds its own
FOOD	[ Taco ]	)After months of inadequate staff who constantly messed up our order and took forever, something changed, and this Taco Bell has returned to what it had been
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Friendly staff, reliable service
FOOD	[ Taco, cook ]	 And that tasty Taco Bell quality I've come to enjoy when I'm good and hammered or just not in the mood to cook or drive very far
FOOD	[ O  ]	Easily the best TB in Madison (though with State St and University/Segoe closed, it's not much of a competition)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything is made very well, very fresh, and very fast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great service
FOOD	[ O  ]	The location rocks too right between 30 and Milwaukee
FOOD	[ O  ]	No complaints and this one is much less sketchy than the one on Park
FOOD	[ Taco ]	It's a Taco Bell
FOOD	[ fast food, choice ]	Certainly you haven't come here with Rick Bayless expectations, but it's still a top tier fast food choice
FOOD	[ O  ]	The interior is great and clean, and the staff is generally friendly, but that's about where the good vibes start falling
FOOD	[ O  ]	Go between lunch and early dinner hours, and you'll never have an issue
FOOD	[ O  ]	 At least, I haven't
FOOD	[ O  ]	After 730pm, however, avoid it
FOOD	[ tacos, meat ]	Mistakes aplenty (two tacos had no meat!) from the drivethru, the waits get longer as the night goes on, and if you think you want to stop here around "fourth meal" time, prepare to be overwhelmed by how much they've run out of
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a little disheartening due to the proximity of our drill location, but we still forget the late night issue and get suckered in once a month
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grade: C+
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes, you read that rating correctly
FOOD	[ Chalk, shrimp ]	Chalk this one up to a dare to see if I could eat 30 shrimp
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not a problem
FOOD	[ O  ]	Interesting clientle aside, this place was surprisingly not sucky
FOOD	[ Lobster, cheddar, biscuits ]	Red Lobster is always really crowded because peeps love the cheddar biscuits
FOOD	[ cheddar, biscuits ]	 Who are we kidding here?  We all know it's the damn cheddar biscuits that keep em' coming
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Even the wait staff knows it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our waiter had his shtick down to a science and his main sell was the what???  
FOOD	[ Cheddar, biscuits ]	Cheddar biscuits
FOOD	[ O  ]	In fact towards the end of our meal he greeted a couple that had just sat down behind us, and ran through his entire spiel word for word as he had done for us
FOOD	[ cheddar, biscuits ]	The humiliating part was that the woman has the EXACT same reaction that I did when he said, "and might I say, the cheddar biscuits are the best part of the meal!"  
FOOD	[ Lobster ]	"Hahaha!  Yes!!"  *nods and smiles like a complete jackass*Typical Red Lobster
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is delish
FOOD	[ biscuits, Lobster ]	cant get enough of those biscuits!Red Lobster is  consistently excellent
FOOD	[ Biscuits ]	The Biscuits may be a draw for some ,(altho I can only eat one myself)
FOOD	[ Lobster ]	I go back over and over because of the great staff, the impeccable Long Island Iced Teas and the always Hot Steamy Perfect  FRESH Lobster
FOOD	[ Lobster ]	Our Madison Red Lobster aims to please like no other chain in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu is extensive and never disappointing
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am thrilled to have them here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Worth the time and money, every visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had lunch at this place on X'max Eve, it was such a disappointing lunch given the food was not served 30 minutes after we finished ordering
FOOD	[ O  ]	After calling the manager the food was finally on the table but apparently there is something within this restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	The manger was friendly but the waiter at our table was showing us some attitude after manager was called up
FOOD	[ O  ]	So, service-wise, it was such a failure
FOOD	[ lobster ]	Food is okay, just like any other red lobster place, but please keep in mind that waiting for 30 minutes is never acceptable
FOOD	[ crab ]	I am so happy they aren't keeping this crab and scallop "pot"
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 It was overly messy and no return of flavor
FOOD	[ crab ]	 Better off just having steamed crab legs instead
FOOD	[ Lobster, crab ]	 Overall, Red Lobster is a great place for me to get my crab fix when I need it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There isn't any other affordable place in town to support my cravings
FOOD	[ Lobster ]	My wife and I stopped at the Red Lobster on 7/4/13
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was open and the parking lot was busy
FOOD	[ bruschetta, shrimp ]	 We started with the wood fire grilled bruschetta with shrimp
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was really good
FOOD	[ bottle, chardonnay, salmon, shrimp, skewers, crab ]	 A bottle of Kendall Jackson chardonnay made it even better!  We then shared a trio of wood fire salmon, shrimp skewers, and crab legs
FOOD	[ salad ]	 It came with a salad
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The flavors were fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The portions were small
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our server was pleasant
FOOD	[ bottle, bruschetta, shrimp ]	 We'd return, but would probably  stay at the bar to enjoy a bottle of KJ with 2 orders of the  wood fire grilled bruschetta with shrimp and pass on the rest
FOOD	[ biscuit ]	love their special biscuit, soft and delicious
FOOD	[ seafood ]	the seafood is fresh and nice
FOOD	[ shrimp, choice ]	endless shrimp is a great choice
FOOD	[ Lobster ]	I absolutely Love Red Lobster
FOOD	[ Lobster, fish ]	 I will go out of my way to eat at a Red Lobster for shell fish
FOOD	[ Lobster ]	 Unfortunately, I have never had a good meal at this Red Lobster
FOOD	[ cook, seafood ]	 They do not know how to cook seafood
FOOD	[ O  ]	Visited this location on 2/27 with a friend for Lobsterfest
FOOD	[ Lobster ]	I ordered the Lobster in Paradise
FOOD	[ lobster ]	The lobster was NOT fresh, it was tough and very chewy
FOOD	[ Lobster ]	I was really bummed out by this because I was really looking forward to trying this dish and I don't normally have any complaints about Red Lobster
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was excellent, our waiter was very friendly and attentive
FOOD	[ O  ]	My boyfriend and I visited for the first time ever on Thursday
FOOD	[ O  ]	I work for Darden, so I was expecting great service and delicious food
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was nothing amazing, but it was still a decent value for the price
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, our waiter was extremely rude
FOOD	[ O  ]	He acted like it was a burden to serve us
FOOD	[ age ]	I'm assuming it was our age, but that shouldn't matter
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm a server myself and it's wrong to treat your guests like they are wasting your time
FOOD	[ O  ]	It made the entire experience quite disappointing
FOOD	[ Lobsters, Biscuits ]	Red Lobsters Biscuits is what drives me to dine at their restaurant
FOOD	[ biscuits ]	However, now that they sell their brand of biscuits at Costco, I fail to see why I would ever dine here again
FOOD	[ seafood ]	I love seafood
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's my favorite food
FOOD	[ Lobster, cook, seafood, garlic, butter ]	However, Red Lobster seems to think that the best way to cook a good seafood dish is to drown it in garlic and butter
FOOD	[ butter ]	My goodness, it's ridiculous how much butter and oil is used in any given dish
FOOD	[ Salmon ]	I am (was) a huge fan of their Salmon New Orleans
FOOD	[ wild rice, broccoli, salmon, shrimp, tabasco, butter sauce ]	It came with wild rice, broccoli, broiled salmon and shrimp covered in a tabasco butter sauce
FOOD	[ butter ]	I always got the sauce on the side because again, the add too much butter/oil
FOOD	[ butter ]	Since the dish is super easy to make, I decided to make it on my own with less butter
FOOD	[ Lobster, bias, butter ]	Viola! Dish turned out better than Red Lobster (IMO which is very bias I will admit) For what you pay to get a good meal, the food is very average while being coated in nothing but butter
FOOD	[ O  ]	Even the salads are iffy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their food is nothing special
FOOD	[ O  ]	The most decent cooker can make anything on their menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	I never understood why the lines are always out of the damn door when I drive by on a weekend
FOOD	[ O  ]	Convenience? Must be
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, people must REALLY like it considering the wait time on a Friday or Saturday night can be up to a hour
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I am to leave one positive comment, the service has always been great in my past experience dining here
FOOD	[ seafood ]	Solid seafood place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I had the tilapia last visit in July 2014 and it was tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service is good but not exceptional on our average visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I could call this 3
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars quite honestly
FOOD	[ fish, salmon, flounder, fish, fish, cod ]	 The one thing that could help them out I think is having more variety of fish, they usually have salmon, mahi mahi or flounder sometimes, tilapia and one other fish fry generic fish like a cod
FOOD	[ grouper, bass, fish, monkfish ]	 I would love to see them get things like grouper or sea bass, or ever more tasty fish for a weekly special like monkfish or barramundi
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But overall a solid night out for a decent price for what you get
FOOD	[ O  ]	I came through this dive while pub-crawling amongst friends
FOOD	[ O  ]	As we lined up at the bar to order beers and grub -- the bartender's muttering under her breath "oh shit
FOOD	[ O  ]	" should have tipped us off to the piss poor service that awaited us
FOOD	[ O  ]	Apparently they're not accustomed to seeing a group of ~12 people waltz in this dump
FOOD	[ fig ]	Go fig'
FOOD	[ rush ]	Mind you, we were very accommodating, and considerate of the surprise rush we created
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food, I was forced to demand a refund
FOOD	[ O  ]	They're lucky I wasn't a complete a**hole and demanded the portion of the tip that I already paid toward my food order
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sure, if you're looking for a very lonely dive all to yourself and a /few/ friends, this might be your place
FOOD	[ O  ]	But for us, it was a complete and utter disaster
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh, did I mention the incessant flies throughout the establishment? Yeah, not cool
FOOD	[ Fish ]	I have a feeling this place usually has better service, but a sudden downpour sent everyone to Dexter's at the same time for their Fish Fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	So we waited
FOOD	[ O  ]	and waited
FOOD	[ fish ]	and a good hour later our fish came out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Folks who ordered to-go showed up only to sit there for a half hour and, well, wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	They got visibly cranky
FOOD	[ beer, cod, waffle, fries, beer ]	The beer battered cod is really good, so are the waffle fries, and the beer guy/owner(?) is definitely uber passionate about what he has on tap
FOOD	[ O  ]	just wasn't a good night for service
FOOD	[ brew, fish ]	Don't expect anything nice, this is just a small bar/restaurant full of Eastsiders looking for a great micro-brew and some good fish
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have to disagree with these other reviews
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband and I frequent Dexters often and really love the place
FOOD	[ waffle, fries, chips ]	We haven't ever had a bad experience with the service and love the food (our faves are the waffle fries, pub chips and the burgers)
FOOD	[ fish, beer ]	The atmosphere isn't all that, but nonetheless it's a great little neighborhood pub with friendly bartenders, good food and great drink specials!Quick Review: If it weren't for the stellar fish fry and the awesome beer selection, this place would be a solid 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	5-star establishment
FOOD	[ fish, beer ]	 Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison's finest
FOOD	[ O  ]	Detailed Review:
FOOD	[ Fish, fish ]	The Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter's Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot
FOOD	[ fish, shrimp ]	 The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye
FOOD	[ O  ]	We put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds
FOOD	[ chunk ]	 We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange
FOOD	[ garnish ]	 I'm sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish
FOOD	[ O  ]	Regardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn't a problem
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Dexter's recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks
FOOD	[ cheese, curds, salad, soup ]	We immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup
FOOD	[ soup, chili, salad ]	 I went with the vegetable garden soup; others at the table went with chili and salad
FOOD	[ soup, soup ]	 The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could've been a little warmer
FOOD	[ chili ]	 I'm told the chili was good as well - not life altering, but good
FOOD	[ beer, cod, shrimp ]	The waiter came back to take our dinner order: two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp
FOOD	[ fish ]	 He said he'd be back in 10 minutes with our fish
FOOD	[ curds, fish ]	Nearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for: refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She apologized profusely
FOOD	[ curds ]	curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us
FOOD	[ beer, cover ]	 The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter's doesn't strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover
FOOD	[ Curds, curds ]	Curds were excellent - not your typical "from the bag" curds, which was a nice surprise
FOOD	[ cheese ]	 They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese; they were cooked perfectly
FOOD	[ Fish ]	Fish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait
FOOD	[ cod ]	 The cod was phenomenal
FOOD	[ fries ]	 Three huge pieces with a mound of fries - now that's what we're talkin' about
FOOD	[ batter ]	 The batter was light, crisp, and flavorful
FOOD	[ fish ]	 The fish was thick, meaty, and perfectly flavored
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I loved every single bite of it
FOOD	[ shrimp ]	I also sampled the Lake Perch and shrimp - both of which were excellent as well
FOOD	[ fish ]	 Huge props to Dexter's for their fish fry - it's definitely a top-10 offering
FOOD	[ curds ]	In the end, they also made things good as the waiter comp'ed us our drinks and curds, so we got out of there for under $40
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We tipped well and called it a night
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'd definitely go back to Dexter's - sure, they dropped the ball, but they did an honorable thing and made everything right by us
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Thanks, Dexter's!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dexter's = WIN
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food = 4
FOOD	[ fish, curds, fries ]	5 stars (excellent fish; curds and fries were stellar)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service = 2 stars (they forgot about us, but made up for it)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value = 2 stars (would've been over $85 for the 4 of us)
FOOD	[ beer ]	Misc = 3 stars (the place isn't much to look at, but has an excellent beer selection
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh - also, parking is hard to come by, so be prepared to park on the street and/or walk a bit to get there
FOOD	[ beer ]	A Pub serving Lagunitas' beer on the tap gets an automatic 4 stars in my book keeping
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't rave enough about how delicious the pint of Gnarleywine was
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is solid, as many people have already Yelped
FOOD	[ O  ]	My lake perch was delicious - in my opinion, better than Avenue Bar's
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was full when I finished the 1/4 of their huge serving portion
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good mix of crowd
FOOD	[ O  ]	Kids, 20-somethings, old and all
FOOD	[ beer ]	I shall be back there to sample more beer and heckle at Olympic games on a TV screen
FOOD	[ fish ]	Checked out Dexter's for a Friday fish fry and it was surprisingly awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great atmosphere for a neighborhood bar
FOOD	[ beer ]	Unexpectedly diverse beer selection that's constantly rotating (had a great Lagunita's Hairy Eyeball)
FOOD	[ Fish ]	Fish was some of the best I've had in Madison
FOOD	[ cod, grease ]	Ordered both the cod & walleye and both were delicious--thinly battered and fried perfectly without excess grease
FOOD	[ Waffle, brew, fries ]	Waffle & brew fries were delicious too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Amazingly, after over a thousand calories of deep fried food, I still didn't feel nasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thanks for helping me kinda stay catholic
FOOD	[ O  ]	Special mention to their outstanding service
FOOD	[ spinach, artichoke, dip, appetizer ]	After someone stole our place in line, they apologized profusely and hit us up with a free spinach & artichoke dip appetizer
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very sweet
FOOD	[ fish ]	I wanted fish fry last night, but we didn't feel like driving, so we figured we'd give Dexter's a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	(It's 3 blocks from our house
FOOD	[ O  ]	) 
FOOD	[ O  ]	My first impression was that this place doesn't belong in Madison - it belongs somewhere much farther north
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was an awesome mix of people there, which is always a good sign for me
FOOD	[ O  ]	They had all sorts of games playing on the multiple tvs (not just basketball, hooray!) and my boyfriend was delighted to note that they have shuffleboard
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were seated immediately (pretty good for a Friday night) and placed our drink orders
FOOD	[ Ale ]	My boyfriend got a Great Lakes Irish Red something or other, and I ordered a Pyramid Winter Ale, which wasn't all that great
FOOD	[ beer ]	I personally wish that they had some more local stuff on the beer menu, but aside from that, I can't really complain about the selection
FOOD	[ beer, cod, carrot, soup, chili, garlic, fries ]	For dinner, I ordered beer battered cod with carrot soup, and my boyfriend ordered a burger with chili garlic fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our food was AMAZING
FOOD	[ fish ]	This is hands down the best fish fry I've had outside of da nortwoods, definitely the best I've had in Madison so far
FOOD	[ soup, cilantro ]	The soup was interesting but delicious - kind of spicy with a hint of cilantro
FOOD	[ chili, garlic, fries ]	I didn't try my boyfriend's burger, but the chili garlic fries were awesome
FOOD	[ garlic, garlic ]	I'm someone who believes that there is no such thing as too much garlic, though, so they might be a bit much for less of a garlic lover
FOOD	[ fish ]	I am so stoked to have found a great fish fry place so close to our house
FOOD	[ O  ]	We will definitely be going back soon
FOOD	[ beer ]	I'm from out of town and was looking for a place to have some beer and some good food and this place was excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 First of all, the waitress was very kind with great service and helpful advice for a couple "newbies"
FOOD	[ beer ]	 The beer selection was great and we got a pitcher of a microbrew for $10, which I thought was a great price
FOOD	[ cheesecurds, fries ]	 The burgers were huge and very tasty along with the cheesecurds and fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I will definitely visit this place again next time we're in town
FOOD	[ beer ]	EXCELLENT tap-beer selection with many microbrews
FOOD	[ liquor ]	 EXCELLENT liquor selection as well with lots of flavored vodkas and rums and the like
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Prices are average
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Always a diverse and friendly crowd
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is okay
FOOD	[ pizza ]	 The pizza is actually pretty delicious, but the other food is not remarkable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great jukebox too
FOOD	[ game ]	 Lots of TVs if you want to watch a game
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The dining area is a little dreary and dark, but the bar area is large and okay
FOOD	[ mozzarella ]	The food is good!  I particularly like the more unusual offerings, like the mozzarella rolls
FOOD	[ pizza ]	 The pizza is only mediocre
FOOD	[ beer ]	The beer selection is wide and diverse, with an emphasis on Wisconsin brews
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It only gets really crowded for trivia nights (Tues and Wed 8-10) but other than that not too bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have been to Dexter's several times for drinks, food and football
FOOD	[ game ]	 I love that on Badger saturdays they have a shuttle that will take you down to the stadium for the football game and pick you back up
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Their breakfast is FANTASTIC and very large portions, 2 of us usually share something
FOOD	[ beer ]	 They have a great selection of beer and pour a great drink too!  The wait staff is fantastic as well, extremely friendly and hard working
FOOD	[ waffle, fries ]	 They seem short staffed often but they all run their butts off and there is hardly a wait for anything!  Last night I had the Rueben w/ waffle fries and it was delicious!  I would suggest getting a big screen TV for watching the games but what they have works well too!  I love this place, a definitely must go to!  They also have trivia on tuesday which is a blast!  The food is great, prices are cheap, staff is fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	what more could you ask for?So, I have been to Dexter's before to play some cards a few months ago, but it wasn't until I moved into the neighborhood that I decided to give the food service a shot
FOOD	[ steak, sandwich, fries ]	  I ordered a steak sandwich and some fries, it was one of the 3 specials being offered
FOOD	[ fries, sandwich ]	The fries were decent enough, but the sandwich was bland dry and just quite dreadful, even for a pub
FOOD	[ cheese, curds, nachos ]	My friend then joined me and we ordered the worst cheese curds I've ever had in my life, and then we had the ironically named "super" nachos
FOOD	[ Nachos ]	The Super Nachos are anything but super
FOOD	[ meat, chips ]	The ground meat (not positive what animal it came from) was again under seasoned and the chips were stale
FOOD	[ O  ]	I thought about sending them back, but I am chalking this up to the back of the house just doesn't give a shit about their job
FOOD	[ O  ]	  The server was the three P's, Pleasant, Prompt, and Pregnant
FOOD	[ O  ]	She was the reason I will return and give the food another shot, and why this Pub is getting even two stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Has a local feel, not quite dive-y but pleasantly local
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not unexpected based on the location
FOOD	[ Beer ]	Went for the Bell's tap take-over for Mad-Craft-Beer-Week
FOOD	[ fish ]	Wife and I had the fish, right tastee
FOOD	[ fish, waffle, fries ]	Had a great 5 piece perch fish fry with yummy waffle fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good food, neighborhood bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been frequenting Dexter's quite often over the past few months (to the tune of around twice per week) and am happy to report that every visit has been absolutely STELLAR
FOOD	[ beer ]	There's the obviously excellent beer selection - it's constantly rotating, and it always tastes fresh and wonderful
FOOD	[ beer ]	 The staff really know their beer - if you ever have a question, don't hesitate to ask because they will offer a sample, suggestions, and plenty of information
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food has been incredible with every visit
FOOD	[ hummus, hummus, waffle, fries, fish ]	 Sure bets: the hummus platter (wow, that IPA hummus is unreal), the waffle fries, any of the burgers, most of the specials, and of course, the fish fry
FOOD	[ tomato, garlic, onions, ham, bacon, egg, cheese, Patty, Melt, cook ]	I've had several burgers (The Abbey (with tomato garlic sauce), the Defibrillator (onions, ham, bacon, egg, cheese), and the Patty Melt) - each was delicious, and they cook them exactly to order
FOOD	[ Chicken, salad ]	I've had the Santa Fe Chicken salad - wow, those roasted veggies are great
FOOD	[ chili, chili, spice ]	 The soups have also been excellent - I recently had the spicy vegetable and the chili; the chili features a spice that slowly crescendos - by the end of the cup, you're feeling a little of that capsaicin love
FOOD	[ melt, ham, cheese ]	I've had several specials, including a turkey melt and a loaded ham and cheese
FOOD	[ fish ]	And of course, I've had the fish fry several more times and am PLEASED to report that it remains excellent
FOOD	[ batter, cod ]	 The hearty, perfectly applied batter and the flaky fresh cod is among Madison's best
FOOD	[ fish ]	 I will be updating my fish fry review with new pictures and details in the near future
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service has markedly improved - the staff is fast, friendly, and as mentioned, super helpful
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I really enjoy their company - it's great to drop by and sit at the bar or to grab a table and chill for a while
FOOD	[ O  ]	UPDATE: Dexters = MAJOR WIN
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food = 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	75 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Really great, really consistent
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service = 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	75 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fast, helpful, attentive
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value = 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quality is there, so the prices are worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	MISC = 5 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great vibe, great crew, good jukebox - love it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Summary: 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I now live about 25 miles from Dexter's, and I don't hesitate to make the drive
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If someone asks, "feel like grabbing a bite tonight?" I'm always happy to recommend Dexter's, even if it means a 30+ minute ride
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's that good
FOOD	[ fish ]	I love their friday night fish fry 
FOOD	[ O  ]	The price is right and great bluegil and perch
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have to keep going back there
FOOD	[ fish, sandwiches ]	love it! I defeintely recommend fish or even sandwiches, burger
FOOD	[ chili, fries, fish, fish ]	Oh, don't forget their greasy chili gralic fries :)I've been to Dexter's several times before for drinks and really liked the place, and a few months ago we went for the Friday fish fry and the food was delicious- some of the best fish fry we've had in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, when we went back a month or so later, we had a horrible experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We had to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food and then when we got it- it was terrible
FOOD	[ garlic, chili, fries, grease ]	 My boyfriend had the garlic chili fries and they arrived not only COLD, but DOUSED in disgusting grease- they were inedible
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to bring a new order, but it turned out the new order was just as terrible as the first one
FOOD	[ beef, sandwich ]	 I had the roast beef sandwich and it was horrible- very dry and bland
FOOD	[ O  ]	 To her credit, the waitress did give us free cupcakes to take home to make up for the horrible food (although it turned out the cupcakes were also inedible and terrible)
FOOD	[ fish ]	We hoped this was just an unusually busy night and not the norm, and because the fish fry is so good, we went back again tonight, hoping for a better experience
FOOD	[ min ]	 We were wrong!  We went around 7 and waited 15 min or so for a table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Once we were seated we placed our order right away with the waiter, since we already knew what we wanted
FOOD	[ O  ]	 An hour later, we were still waiting for our food
FOOD	[ fish, waffle, fries, fish, fries ]	 All we ordered was the fish and waffle fries- so nothing complicated- and on such a busy night, you'd think they'd be making sure to keep batches of fish and fries going steadily into the fryer
FOOD	[ fish ]	 When we finally got our food, it was the tasty fish we'd remembered from before, but by that time, we were so tired and crabby from having to wait for so long, it wasn't quite so enjoyable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 After our meal, we had to wait quite a long time for the waiter to bring the check, and then he didn't come back to pick it up for a good 15 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We would still go back to Dexter's just for drinks, but I don't think we'll be going there to eat the food anymore
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Two terrible experiences with inexcusably long waits is enough to keep us from going back for dinner
FOOD	[ fish ]	 It's too bad because the fish is good, but not good enough to justify the SLOW service
FOOD	[ fish, food poisoning ]	Edit: Turns out the fish wasn't so good- ended up being up all night with food poisoning
FOOD	[ fish ]	 Yup, definitely will NOT be going back there for dinner!Decided to stop in on a recent Friday to try the fish fry based on reviews
FOOD	[ O  ]	Worried that would be waiting for a table, we went in hopeful
FOOD	[ O  ]	Got a booth right away for four and it was very busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had been in here pre-Sandlot days and wasn't impressed but this "make-over" is proving positive
FOOD	[ O  ]	Key points:
FOOD	[ beer ]	- waitress was great, offered tastes of beer to help my decision
FOOD	[ cod ]	- perch and cod, both good and plenty of it
FOOD	[ fries ]	- pub fries were great, not overcooked like so may places
FOOD	[ beer ]	- echoing other compliments on the beer selection, nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	- fine for the kids too, at least earlier around dinner time (5-7)
FOOD	[ fish ]	I'd come back to try non-fish fry some night
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really nice place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great beers on tap
FOOD	[ fish, fish ]	I will preface this with the fact I deem it deplorable that a WI fish fry joint does not have pan fish of some sort on Friday nights
FOOD	[ beer ]	I've been to Dexters a couple times now and am in love with one thing about it; the beer selection
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Pretty impressive for a tiny little place
FOOD	[ crappie ]	 Each time I've been I've gotten walleye as previously stated there is no superior crappie, bluegill, perch, etc
FOOD	[ cod ]	 and I refuse to order cod
FOOD	[ cod ]	 I've never caught a cod in WI waters and until I do I'm not ordering it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The walleye is ok to goodish that's all that needs be said
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We again had the kid with us, and the staff was very kind and accomodating
FOOD	[ fish, cod ]	 Also be prepared to wait for a table on Fridays, apparently I'm the only fish snob around and the cod is the hot item I guess
FOOD	[ beer ]	 The waiting isn't too bad as I said before, their beer offerings are pretty boss
FOOD	[ O  ]	 (Yeah I said 'boss', what of it?)Lot's of things going right for this place, as long as you get there at the right time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great selection of micro brews
FOOD	[ O  ]	Interesting and delicious food
FOOD	[ beer ]	The last time I went in for food and a beer it was lovely
FOOD	[ O  ]	However on previous occasions, I was freezing in winter, or deafened on trivia night
FOOD	[ O  ]	I hope they get a better announcer and a better PA system so customers don't have to suffer through the distortion
FOOD	[ O  ]	In on Tuesday, 7/24
FOOD	[ pizza ]	 Tried the pizza burger after someone finally decided to come A
FOOD	[ O  ]	get a drink order after sitting down 5 minutes prior
FOOD	[ O  ]	 B
FOOD	[ chalk ]	 Recite the specials off the chalk board because they didn't know what the specials were
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 The  burger was ok, but didn't have the peperoni flavor I would have expected
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've been here a ton of times, and the food is for the most part, very good, but service this evening was horrible
FOOD	[ beverage ]	 I had to ask for another beverage 1/2 way through my meal, and ultimately walk to the bar to pay the bill
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Go drunk
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You may not notice that the staff doesn't give a crap about you, or getting your money
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We could have walked out
FOOD	[ O  ]	and almost did without paying
FOOD	[ O  ]	We venture here often, as it's walking distance from our house
FOOD	[ fish ]	Fine fish fry and good other offerings
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really kid friendly before 7 (seriously, the dining area is almost like a day care sometimes), adult friendly after
FOOD	[ beer ]	Decent beer selection most of the time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thumbs up
FOOD	[ O  ]	I frequent this place because it's close to where I live, and I do team trivia on Wednesdays
FOOD	[ beer, salad ]	 The beer selection is both expansive and fresh (they open new taps frequently), and the food is excellent bar-food fare with some healthy salad-type options
FOOD	[ chicken, bean, fries ]	 But hey, you're there for bar food, right?  The burgers are yummy (you can sub in chicken or black bean), the fries and rings are tasty
FOOD	[ pizza ]	 I've heard good things about the pizza, but haven't tried it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There are lots of TVs, so if you care to watch some sports it's a great place to do so
FOOD	[ O  ]	The servers are very nice, but on busy nights they can be super slammed and stretched thin, so you may have to wait several minutes for service
FOOD	[ cook ]	 The kitchen isn't all that large and they actually cook food to order, so do plan to wait a bit for your meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 In fact, that's the only down-side I can think of about this place - the service can sometimes be slow
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're not into trivia, I suggest that you avoid Tuesday and Wednesday nights after 8:00 PM or so, because that's when the trivia crowd is there and the place is packed to the gills
FOOD	[ garlic, fries ]	**Don't pass up the garlic chile fries!**
FOOD	[ beer, fish ]	I love the tap beer selection and all of the entrees we've tried have been great!I'm not sure what happened to Dexter's fish fry, but wow - it seems like it's on a downward spiral, which is unfortunate, because it used to be one of my very favorites
FOOD	[ fish, fish, fish ]	I've revisited this fish fry three times this year, and each time has been underwhelming - I'm not sure if they've switched fish suppliers or what, but I've got serious reservations about returning for the fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	We arrived last night (9/21) at around 8:30pm, and the place was packed to the gills
FOOD	[ O  ]	 As luck would have it, a table opened up near the bar, so we snagged it and decided to eat in the bar area
FOOD	[ appetizer ]	 An extremely helpful waitress immediately took our drink and appetizer orders; we browsed the menu until she returned
FOOD	[ appetizer, hummus, cod ]	With drinks in hand and the appetizer (IPA hummus plate) underway, she regrettably informed us they had run out of cod
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We opted for 2 plates of the lake perch and 1 plate of the walleye instead (I was dining with a couple of friends)
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was excellent; she regularly checked on us, refilled drinks, and kept us in the loop the entire night
FOOD	[ O  ]	 5-stars for service
FOOD	[ fish, grease ]	The fish arrived and it was swimming in grease
FOOD	[ batter ]	 Gone was the excellent batter that I had experienced in the past; the perch was rubbery and extreeeeeeemely fishy tasting
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The walleye was equally greasy, over-battered, and also very fishy tasting
FOOD	[ fish, fish ]	I love fish, and my friends are huge fishermen - they take trips to Canada, the boundary waters, and all sorts of other places to fish
FOOD	[ fish ]	 But even they agreed that the fish didn't taste like it should - one barely finished his smallish plate of perch; the other left at least half of the walleye
FOOD	[ fish ]	 I felt especially terrible when they asked me why I felt the fish was so good here
FOOD	[ O  ]	:-(
FOOD	[ hummus ]	The rest of their food remains superb, especially the IPA hummus
FOOD	[ hummus ]	 I'm certain you won't find a better hummus in the area
FOOD	[ habanero, shrimp ]	 I would also recommend the habanero shrimp and any of their burgers - they're excellent
FOOD	[ fish ]	Our check arrived; we settled-up and left, disappointed by the fish
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's a shame, because I like Nick, and I really like the crew here, but something is amiss
FOOD	[ clam, chowder, chili ]	:-(Best clam chowder I've ever had! My husband loves their chili and I believe all their soups are made from scratch and I've always been pleased
FOOD	[ Fish ]	We typically only go for Friday Fish Fry and are never disappointed, just be prepared for a long wait for both a table and the food but I believe it is worth it
FOOD	[ beer, sandwiches ]	great beer choices that change frequently and we were pleasantly surprised by their sandwiches as well
FOOD	[ game ]	We went in on an off night (Monday) to watch a football game
FOOD	[ game ]	We were seated right away and the game atmosphere was great with many televisions so you don't have to worry about where you are seated
FOOD	[ game ]	I have been to Dexter's quite a few times now, usually for their specialty tappings or to watch a football game
FOOD	[ O  ]	Atmosphere - I would classify Dexter's as hole-in-the-wall hipster-esque classic Wisconsin bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	It will appeal to people who just want to go to a local pub and crack open a Hamm's
FOOD	[ beer ]	It will also appeal to people who want an unassuming space to quaff some delicious craft beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	It isn't fancy, but it is roomy
FOOD	[ O  ]	My one complaint is that it is always chilly
FOOD	[ coat ]	I usually keep my coat on or I freeze
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food - The food at Dexter's is pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is slightly amped up pub food
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is most certainly better than your standard pub fare
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	They have some yummy options for spicy, heart-clogging sandwiches that my husband loves
FOOD	[ Fajita, salad, pulled pork, sandwich ]	I like the Fajita salad and pulled pork sandwich
FOOD	[ Beer ]	Beer -  Fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is real the reason to go to Dexters
FOOD	[ beer ]	They have rotating taps of featured beer
FOOD	[ brewing ]	They are attentive to trends in craft brewing and will often have something that is new and difficult to find
FOOD	[ beer ]	Their bartenders are usually knowledgeable about the beer, and they know how to pour a hefeweizen correctly
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is not the best deal you will find in town, but they will also have pours other places don't get
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service - Also pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have no complaints about the staff here
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are attentive without being annoying
FOOD	[ O  ]	They also know what they are talking about which is refreshing
FOOD	[ O  ]	As a plus, in the warmer months, they have an outdoor space you can play volleyball
FOOD	[ O  ]	Or you can join their volleyball league
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dexter's Pub is a great neighborhood bar
FOOD	[ beer ]	Good beer selection, which always rotates
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great service, friendly staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have always gone on Wednesday night for trivia (8pm) and its usually full but you can always get a seat if you arrive around 7:30pm
FOOD	[ portabella, mushroom, sandwich ]	Last time, I had the portabella mushroom sandwich
FOOD	[ portabella ]	It was good, but sort of lacked portabella (the piece was pretty small and meek)
FOOD	[ waffle, fries ]	The waffle fries were good
FOOD	[ hummus ]	Also tried the hummus one time, which was awesome!
FOOD	[ fish ]	Overall, Dexter's is a cool spot that I will continue to frequent!This has easily become my go-to Friday fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I like it so much, I've been hesitant to even write this review
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nonetheless, Dexter's does it right
FOOD	[ cod, batter ]	Fresh, Bering sea cod enveloped in a crispy, salty batter keeps me dreaming of Fridays
FOOD	[ clam, chowder ]	 The clam chowder is phenomenal and so are the rest of their soups
FOOD	[ O  ]	obviously lovingly tended to and cooked from homemade stocks
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I could further pontificate, but no need
FOOD	[ O  ]	the execution in the kitchen is stellar
FOOD	[ beer ]	Now, the beer list is exquisite in my opinion
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I love Madison, but many bars get so caught up on local-centric taps lists
FOOD	[ Ale ]	 Consequently, more often than not, you walk in to see the taps jammed with Ale Ayslum, Lake Louie and Capital
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	but I'll be damned to say I could choke down another Hopalicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Dexters, on the other hand, opens their taps up to pretty much anything
FOOD	[ beer ]	 From Toppling Goliath (which I love, but you can't really get outside of Iowa and Wisco) to Belgian Flander's Reds, they kill it with their beer selection
FOOD	[ beer ]	 Also, I really respect that they let you know on the beer list what's on deck
FOOD	[ O  ]	this has kept me coming back many-a-times
FOOD	[ fish ]	So why not the 5-stars?  Well, we've run into some seriously long waits, both for a table and then for the fish
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If they could streamline a little more in the kitchen, I'd gladly give it that extra star
FOOD	[ O  ]	 In the mean time, we NEVER come here on Fridays after 6pm
FOOD	[ O  ]	forget it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you don't mind dining with the Greyhairs
FOOD	[ O  ]	you'll do just fine
FOOD	[ fish ]	After reading several rave reviews for the fish fry we decided to try this place
FOOD	[ Lent ]	 We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday in Lent and knew we were already in trouble when parking was hard to find
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The dining room was packed and we were told there would be an hour wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Since we had driven across town, we decided to wait it out in the bar
FOOD	[ beer ]	 There is plenty of room to wait and have a beer from the huge selection they have
FOOD	[ O  ]	 In 30 minutes we were called for our table
FOOD	[ cod ]	 Two of us ordered the lake perch and one ordered the deep fried cod
FOOD	[ cod, blue gill, shrimp ]	 There is also baked cod, walleye, blue gill and shrimp to choose from
FOOD	[ fish, choice, potato, waffle, fries, fries, potato, chips, cottage cheese ]	 The fish comes with your choice of  - baked potato, waffle fries, pub fries, homemade potato chips, and some other things like cottage cheese etc
FOOD	[ waffle, fries, potato, chips, fries, beer ]	 We had waffle fries, potato chips and the pub fries, which are beer pattered
FOOD	[ cole, slaw ]	 You also get a small container of cole slaw and a white grocery store roll
FOOD	[ fish ]	 There was a short wait for our fish, but the dining room was still packed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When it arrived, it was hot, tasty and a generous serving
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We were all very satisfied with our dinner
FOOD	[ potato, chips ]	 I thought the homemade potato chips were excellent, they came out warm and crispy
FOOD	[ tartar sauce ]	 The only thing I did not care for was the tartar sauce, can't place what it was, but had a funny taste to it to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Everyone that waited on us was friendly and efficient without being intrusive
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Wish this place was closer to my side of town, but we will definitely try it again
FOOD	[ brew, fries ]	 Get there early or expect to wait!Absolutely the best place to get a delicious Reuben and brew fries in town! My favorite dive on the Eastside of Madison
FOOD	[ fish ]	I started out on a quest to find Madison's best fish fry and stumbled upon this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	One thing to know beforehand is they do not take reservations and they pack the place on Friday nights
FOOD	[ O  ]	Expect to wait a while
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a nice little neighborhood bar on the east side of Madison that has a huge following
FOOD	[ fish, fish ]	They offer several different types of fish for the Friday fish fry
FOOD	[ Cod ]	Fried or Baked Cod, Perch, or Walleye
FOOD	[ cod ]	I went with the fried cod which was absolutely delicious
FOOD	[ garlic, chili, fries, chili ]	I couldn't turn down the garlic chili fries or their home made chili
FOOD	[ fish ]	Needless to say I could have used a wheel chair for the way out! It was by far one of the better fish fry joints to go to in town and I will for sure be back
FOOD	[ lent ]	My only complaint with the place was that they don't take reservations and they won't do carry out during lent (due to an overwhelming amount of business) but it's good to see a business that does so much business they have to turn some away
FOOD	[ O  ]	Easily one of my favorite local hangouts, Dexter's is a "dive" bar without the "dive
FOOD	[ beer ]	" The beer selection is wonderful, bartenders and staff are knowledgeable and attentive, and the food is well above typical bar food standards
FOOD	[ game ]	There are tables for dining, a long bar for sitting and watching the game, and volleyball courts out back for summer fun
FOOD	[ fish ]	If you're going for the food, I have to recommend the fish fry and/or nacho platter
FOOD	[ beer ]	If you're going for the beer, you won't be disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	And if you're looking for a fun place to watch a Badger victory with friends, you've got the right bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	6/27/13 Met my wife for drinks & dinner at Dexter's Pub
FOOD	[ beer ]	 They have a great tap beer selection (lots of micro brews)
FOOD	[ bourbon ]	 They also have many bourbon and whiskey options
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I opted for a cold and yellow pint of PBR
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I rode my bike after all
FOOD	[ hummus ]	 We started with their hummus plate
FOOD	[ grill ]	 We'd recommend you ask them to put the pita on the flat grill vs
FOOD	[ O  ]	having them fried or plain
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We had them plain which was okay
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There were plenty of crisp veggies
FOOD	[ catfish, fries ]	 We then shared a catfish po'boy with fries
FOOD	[ catfish ]	 The catfish was generous and tasty
FOOD	[ bread ]	 The bread was okay
FOOD	[ fries ]	 The fries were great
FOOD	[ grill ]	 They do a great job for only having a flat grill and a deep fryer
FOOD	[ fish ]	No carry out on Friday nights!?!  I'm new to the area and was looking to trying Dexters Friday fish fry after hearing so many great reviews
FOOD	[ O  ]	Unfortunately I didn't get the chance as they do not provide a carry out option on Friday nights
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was speechless went told this over the phone!  I did try another place (Brothers Three) that was happy to provide carry out to this customer and it was wonderful!9/27/13 My wife and I stopped in for lunch
FOOD	[ catfish, bread, Hop, Ale, Stout ]	 Their catfish po'boy is even more awesome because their bread improved!  They have many great reasons to stop in, but if you haven't tried Central Waters Hop Rise Session Ale or Central Waters Satin Solstice Imperial Stout grab a seat and imbibe!The food is great and the craft beers are even better
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff is very friendly but I docked them two whole stars because the service is very untimely
FOOD	[ O  ]	You will often spend time waiting for what you want, and if you are in a large group prepare to be there a long time
FOOD	[ O  ]	How hard is it to franchise a Portillo's? 
FOOD	[ hot dog, beef, chocolate, cake ]	You know, the Chicago hot dog, beef world famous chocolate cake shake chain? 
FOOD	[ Italian beef sandwich ]	It's a question that's been running through my mind since moving to Madison where I have had no luck finding an authentic Chicago style Italian beef sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	Until Lydia dished that Dexter's is way more than a hip hangout for trivia
FOOD	[ O  ]	(And she was right
FOOD	[ Italian beef sandwich ]	They have THE BEST Italian beef sandwich I've found in the 608 and pretty darn near close to Portillo's
FOOD	[ sandwiches, bread ]	Only thing that's slightly off from the hundreds of sandwiches I swallowed back in the windy city - the bread
FOOD	[ O  ]	But that's not enough to make me never want to order it again
FOOD	[ O  ]	in fact I'm thinking about going there tomorrow
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere leans more neighborhood dive which might not make you say, "let me see a menu," but do! Because there's a solid selection of typical bar fair kicked up a notch and healthier alternatives too if you're not a fan of fried
FOOD	[ beer ]	The craft beer selection is solid and changes often
FOOD	[ O  ]	so often that they designed an app for smartphones so you keep track of what's what! THEY HAVE AN APP! And while I didn't partake, I hear housemade desserts are pretty rad
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	I'm ok going back to try one, it means I can get another sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't live quiiiiite close enough for this to be MY neighborhood bar, but it meets all the requirements: laid-back atmosphere, great food, and seriouslygreatcraftbeerlist
FOOD	[ cherry, beer ]	Their beers are all of the cant-pick-up-at-the-gas-station variety and it's worth coming by just for that--the menu diversity is the cherry on top of my craft beer float
FOOD	[ event, fish ]	After going to the Yelp event, I could not wait to go back!  We went for Wednesday night fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is not a year round occurrence from my understanding
FOOD	[ O  ]	 More like, a fall occurrence
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was with 5 other people
FOOD	[ fish ]	 Four ordered the fish fry
FOOD	[ fish ]	 There were three fish options
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The most expensive was $14 and was a huge amount of food
FOOD	[ fish ]	 One of my friends ordered the fish baked and it looked amazing
FOOD	[ Beef ]	I tried the Italian Beef
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 While, it is not a Chicago style sandwich, it did not disappoint
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was the closest I have found to Chicago-style
FOOD	[ bread ]	 It would almost be there, except for the bread
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	My only complaint?  Adding your side to the price of the sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	Otherwise, the owner is friendly, the staff is friendly
FOOD	[ beer ]	 The beer menu is ridiculously long
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Go to Dexter's, it will not disappoint
FOOD	[ rush ]	We drove 45 minutes through rain and rush hour darkness to get here, but were not disappointed
FOOD	[ soup ]	Service was fast and we had two great beers and our soup before we knew it
FOOD	[ beer, chips, onion, dip, pretzel, dips ]	One of the best beer lists in town too! Great homemade chips and french onion dip and a locally made pretzel with great dips came next
FOOD	[ tartar sauce ]	Smelt fry was great! Very lightly breaded as advertised (nothing like the pre breaded frozen kind) and great tartar sauce
FOOD	[ Pizza ]	Pizza had great thin crust
FOOD	[ O  ]	We would definitely come back again for many reasons
FOOD	[ beer ]	As a non beer lover (I know, I know), I wasn't expecting to fall in love with Dexter's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I don't think one has to worry about that considering my experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our food was just so
FOOD	[ O  ]	terrible
FOOD	[ salmon, salad ]	 I ordered the salmon salad, not having any huge expectations with it due to ordering it at a hipsterish hole in the wall type establishment
FOOD	[ salmon, color ]	 The salmon was a weird color
FOOD	[ croutons, tomatoes, cucumber ]	it had greasy fried peppers, croutons, tomatoes and cucumber
FOOD	[ food poisoning ]	I was pretty sure I was going to get food poisoning but miraculously, I did not
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My husband ordered a burger
FOOD	[ bun ]	the bun was dry and crusty, he asked for it medium well and it was slightly alive still
FOOD	[ leaf, lettuce, tomato ]	 Plus, they didn't even provide a leaf of lettuce or tomato
FOOD	[ cheese, hamburger, bacon ]	 Just cheese, a ball of raw hamburger and 1/3 of a slice of bacon
FOOD	[ waffle, fries ]	 Our meal was so unsatisfying but at least the waffle fries were the highlight of the night!Just in case anyone was wondering
FOOD	[ Italian beef sandwich ]	the Italian beef sandwich and hot wings are just as tasty when you take them to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	You know
FOOD	[ O  ]	in case you needed that information
FOOD	[ waffle, fries ]	I crisped up the waffle fries in the oven when I got home, and it was like sitting there
FOOD	[ O  ]	But without the friendly faces and awesome tap line up
FOOD	[ fish ]	Still tasty!  This is just an update to say that trivia night is only on Tuesdays now, and Friday night is very busy with their fish fry - so go early!I love Dexter's
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a short walk away, so I go there a lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been there dozens of times
FOOD	[ soup ]	Their daily specials are usually what I check out, and they come with a cup of soup
FOOD	[ soup ]	And that soup is usually amazing
FOOD	[ chili ]	Their chili is always fantastic
FOOD	[ fish ]	Their fish fry is also very good
FOOD	[ beef, brisket, sandwich ]	They have a beef brisket sandwich called the BBLT that is always really good
FOOD	[ beer ]	They have plenty of beer on tap, and plenty of televisions for your viewing pleasure
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff is always friendly and willing to recommend something
FOOD	[ fish ]	My husband, my mom, and I braved Dexter's on a Friday night for fish
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh man, I am so glad we did!
FOOD	[ O  ]	We went into it expecting a wait, and we did end up waiting about an hour and a half
FOOD	[ O  ]	At first, we had to stand in the bar area, but we got drinks relatively quickly and were able to snag a table after about a half hour of standing
FOOD	[ beer ]	Their beer selection is amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	I tried 3 different new-to-me beers and there were still a bunch more I wanted to taste
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hooray for options!
FOOD	[ appetizer, spinach dip ]	We ordered soon after sitting down and didn't have to wait long for our appetizer (spinach dip with veggies & pita)
FOOD	[ dip ]	The dip was good and their pita (fried) was as awesome as you would assume fried pita would be
FOOD	[ cod, shrimp ]	Our meals were great too! Between the three of us we had cod, perch (or bluegill? woops, can't remember), and a shrimp po-boy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would order any of our three choices again
FOOD	[ fish ]	In summary: the fish fry is worth the wait & the Friday night crowd
FOOD	[ fish, Beer ]	We went to Dexter's on Friday for the fish fry at the start Craft Beer week
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So we knew the wait would be long
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was about an hour or more wait to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But that didn't matter because we got to have a couple of tasty beers
FOOD	[ clam, chowder ]	 Once we sat down to eat, we started off with the clam chowder
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I loved it
FOOD	[ clam ]	 The chunks of clam were huge and tender, not chewy
FOOD	[ soup, onions, potatoes ]	 The soup wasn't too thick that it overshadowed the clams, onions and potatoes
FOOD	[ cod ]	 We both ordered the deep fried cod
FOOD	[ O  ]	 One of the best we've had
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It came out hot and crispy
FOOD	[ batter, cod ]	 The batter wasn't too oily and you could taste the flakey cod
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waitress was very busy but always available if we needed anything
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I can't wait to eat there more
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love the atmosphere at Dexters
FOOD	[ beer ]	 It's a great mix of people who are friendly and there to enjoy the beer/food
FOOD	[ beer ]	Dexter's is a nice neighborhood bar with good beer selection, and GREAT drink specials
FOOD	[ O  ]	Always something to drink for cheap
FOOD	[ O  ]	I only discovered this when looking for a place to watch the Stanley Cup playoffs (Go Hawks!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is pretty mediocre
FOOD	[ pizza ]	The pizza is good - they seem to make it fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here had I not lived in the neighborhood at the time
FOOD	[ O  ]	The pub quiz seems to be a good pull on Tuesdays, outdoor volleyball too, and the crowd seems fun in general
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place will always have a special place in my heart for reasons known by me and Steve L
FOOD	[ O  ]	:-)
FOOD	[ beer ]	I'm fairly new to the world of craft beers, but I'm a big fan of the beer list here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Always something new and interesting to try
FOOD	[ appetizers ]	I haven't had a proper dinner here yet, just appetizers
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have been just "ok"
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu sounds promising, though
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like the open style of the kitchen area, always curious to see what folks are up to in there
FOOD	[ O  ]	The wait staff was very attentive, if slightly impersonal, as well
FOOD	[ flip ]	I found it odd that a waitress was allowed to work wearing flip flops, though
FOOD	[ O  ]	(I notice details
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was a nice cozy place to wind up the end of my work week last night
FOOD	[ O  ]	To be continued
FOOD	[ fish, appetizers ]	Haven't been back for the fish fry for quite some time, but have been in for drinks and appetizers on numerous occasions since the last review of nearly 2 years ago
FOOD	[ beer ]	+ One of the best craft beer lists in all of Madison; changes daily
FOOD	[ beer ]	+ Host tons of beer-related events and tap-takeovers
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Even when swamped, you can usually find a seat at the bar or at a high-top
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Service is quite prompt and thorough, but as noted, not super personable/friendly 
FOOD	[ hummus ]	+ Hopalicious hummus remains one of my favorite plates in the area
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Not a huge fan of the pizzas; I've tried several and they're not all that awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	Can't put my finger on it - something's just "off" with them
FOOD	[ Sandwiches ]	+ Sandwiches are excellent
FOOD	[ Salmon, salad, salmon ]	- Salmon salad has been hit-or-miss; often times, the salmon has been waaaaay undercooked (like still nearly frozen in the middle in spots)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think it depends on who's cooking that night
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Plenty of televisions, but they aren't "in your face" like they are at some bars
FOOD	[ Buffet, buffets ]	+ Accept credit/debit (a rarity in this neighborhood)Old Country Buffet is above average as far as American buffets go
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're in the mood for it, it's pretty tasty
FOOD	[ buffet ]	It's old country buffet, what do you expect?  Lots of different stuff to choose from, and definitely caters to those who want to eat themselves into bland oblivion
FOOD	[ cuisine, chef ]	 If you go here looking for exotic, flavorful, unusual cuisine skillfully prepared by a fantastic chef you must be well deluded
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ahhhhh, "The land of &" A meal & a heart attack, or 1000 cc's of insulin
FOOD	[ Buffet ]	Never was a fan of Old Country Buffet, but the new revamp has brought some life into this old staple
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's still full of Blue Hairs and people who sport clothes that are covered w/ stains and holes
FOOD	[ Buffet ]	Also, if you are rotund like I am, your self-esteem will be boosted when you realize no matter how fat you are, their is always someone fatter at the Hometown Buffet
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food choices here are awesome
FOOD	[ Mexican ]	Mexican, American, Italian
FOOD	[ O  ]	all piping hot and ready to pig on
FOOD	[ salad ]	The salad bar has surprisingly fresh veggies and staff works hard to keep the place clean and well stocked
FOOD	[ O  ]	Too bad every freakin kid in the place has to touch everything, wipe their hands on their nose, then bare hand the items
FOOD	[ chicken ]	I even saw the staff kick some woman out for filling up an old "Country Crock" container w/ chicken wings
FOOD	[ O  ]	I guess takeout isn't allowed
FOOD	[ O  ]	LOL 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good desert choices too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Soft serve and the usual box-made cakes and pies
FOOD	[ O  ]	The quality of the food won't win any awards
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not nearly as good as a freshly prepared 5 star meal, but better than prison
FOOD	[ O  ]	What do you expect for $9
FOOD	[ O  ]	95?For those that like an abundance of mediocre food that is poorly cooked than this is the place to be
FOOD	[ O  ]	For those that actually like good food I would suggest another restaurant and preferably not a chain
FOOD	[ yogurt, shrimp ]	The only saving grace was the frozen yogurt and the fried shrimp
FOOD	[ buffet ]	Okay selection of hot and cold stations for a buffet restaurant that is near the interstate and right in the middle of nowhere
FOOD	[ yogurt ]	The sweet station made my day - frozen yogurt
FOOD	[ buffets ]	If you are into buffets, try them out
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food is diverse
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food is hot 
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 Good flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's good for a family of picky eaters
FOOD	[ O  ]	All you can eat for under $10
FOOD	[ junk ]	what is there to complain about?? If you want junk food and you want lots of it oh this is THE place to go! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	You've got several hungry mouths to feed and  not that much $$ in the wallet
FOOD	[ O  ]	then this is THE place to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	Other than that I'm not sure why you would go here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Truly a guilty pleasure
FOOD	[ salad, chick peas ]	I love the salad bar (it always has chick peas)
FOOD	[ meatloaf, ketchup, meatloaf ]	I certainly have a weak spot for the meatloaf and the sweet ketchup sauce, in fact it my favorite meatloaf in town
FOOD	[ buffet ]	Do I always end up with heart burn? You bet! Will I come back again (mostly cause the 6'-5" teen boy always asks)? Of course!This buffest reminded me of a Las Vegas buffet except all the food gave me heartburn
FOOD	[ buffet ]	 I'd been to a hometown buffet before so when my bf suggested it I relied on my memory of the experience and agreed to go
FOOD	[ Buffet ]	 Unfortunately my memory must have been jilted by the occasion or this Hometown Buffet was just bad, I dont know
FOOD	[ O  ]	 what I do know is that the food is cheap, about 10$ per person
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is also soft
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And by this i mean everything is overcooked
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And it all gave me heartburn that lasted all day
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So will I be back?  Maybe in about 10 years when I've forgotten about this experience
FOOD	[ cheese ]	I love the Mac n cheese
FOOD	[ chocolate, cake ]	But the last time I went, I grabbed a chocolate cake
FOOD	[ cheese, cake ]	When I took my first bite, I was hard! And the cheese cake was not good either
FOOD	[ O  ]	$11 for dinner
FOOD	[ buffet ]	Cheap typical american buffet fare
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not much more to say
FOOD	[ O  ]	Highs:
FOOD	[ Fried chicken ]	+ Fried chicken
FOOD	[ Cheese ]	+ Mac & Cheese

FOOD	[ Fudge, cake ]	+ Fudge cake!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lows:
FOOD	[ popcorn, shrimp ]	- Gross popcorn shrimp
FOOD	[ pot roast ]	- Dry pot roast
FOOD	[ fruit, cantaloupe, peaches, oranges, buffet, holidays ]	- Sad selection of fruit (just cantaloupe and canned peaches/oranges)I have been to this hometown buffet multiple times, a lot for family holidays
FOOD	[ buffet ]	Recently we moved to California, went to a hometown buffet here, and were severely disappointed
FOOD	[ food poisoning ]	Hopefully we won't get food poisoning, but it isn't looking very promising I wanted to write a review on the Madison one since it is sooo much better
FOOD	[ O  ]	First off, great selection of food! Beyond great
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't think I have tasted something I didn't like
FOOD	[ O  ]	We normally always have the same waiter, his name is Carlos, and he is great! The manager Tony is THE BEST! Seriously! I miss going to this place
FOOD	[ fried chicken, chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy ]	I go here solely for the fried chicken and chicken tenders, with sides of mashed potatoes with gravy and stuffing
FOOD	[ honey ]	The yeast rolls are nicely honey buttered
FOOD	[ salad, fruit ]	The salad and fruit bar is really good too
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But the other choices don't interest me
FOOD	[ dessert, ice cream ]	The dessert are not too good except the ice cream
FOOD	[ buffet ]	So this is a typical buffet
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Wide selection of food and it was decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	  They had a good spread for Thanksgiving with all the typical food and sweets
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I would not be a regular, but when I am looking for a huge meal that is decently priced, I will visit Hometown again
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Since I visited on Thanksgiving the place was packed
FOOD	[ buffet ]	     The staff did a great job keeping the buffet well stocked and I was seated in about 10 miniutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Surprisingly excellent Easter Dinner
FOOD	[ brunch, horseradish, cream ]	 Prime rib to die for (better than we've had at Great Dane's brunch), and their homemade horseradish cream is really good
FOOD	[ Coconut cream, pie, carrot, cake ]	Actually has some snort to it! Coconut cream pie & carrot cake both delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	May become our new Easter tradition! (Sure liked not having to clean up my trashed kitchen!)Wow this place is the suck
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We ate there twice
FOOD	[ tofu, pasta, bowl ]	 The first time the tofu was massively burned to a crisp and the second time I found a rusty fishing hook in my pasta bowl
FOOD	[ O  ]	 WTF??  I've eaten at other locations and they are just fine, but this one must have bad staff and management problems because they are the SUCK
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Stay away
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food, reasonable prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been to the location on Univ avenue and it's pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like the East town location
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food, love the ability to eat on the patio
FOOD	[ O  ]	Location is a lot different than the downtown one, crazy busy around the lunch hour
FOOD	[ O  ]	but the food
FOOD	[ peanut ]	oh the food!  There is nothing like the indo peanut
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It may not be authentic, but it is delicious, for sure
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Worth a stop - be extra nice to the staff, they are awesome
FOOD	[ Noodles ]	I love Noodles & Company, and fact being this one is only a few miles away from my home when I drive back from work - I always call in for a pick up
FOOD	[ O  ]	My penna rosa is the best from here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I might have found a new addiction
FOOD	[ Noodles ]	I can't count the number of times I visited Noodles and Company while I was in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I loved it so much that I emailed them to see if they would open one in Auburn
FOOD	[ O  ]	Only time will tell
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really only tried their Asian menu
FOOD	[ noodles, peanut ]	I tried the Japanese udon noodles and the Vietnamese peanut saute, with the later being my favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've had the Pad Thai in the past- when I lived in Columbia MO, and I remember that being excellent as well
FOOD	[ fast food ]	It is fast food but really doesn't feel like it
FOOD	[ china ]	The food comes to you after you are seated in fine white china
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything I've tried has been wonderfully made and essentially everything on their menu is vegetarian
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can add a protein if you desire
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only blah item was the Flatbread
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have visited three different locations in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	This one is a bit smaller than the one on University but it is still great
FOOD	[ O  ]	The employees keep the tables clean and are always willing to help
FOOD	[ Noodles ]	I love Noodles
FOOD	[ O  ]	I know I'll be back a few more times before headed back to my village of Auburn
FOOD	[ O  ]	Always a family favorite!  Tastes great, cheap, and filling!Wonderful as always
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's our go-to for a quick bite to eat
FOOD	[ Cheese ]	Your kids will like the Wisconsin Mac n Cheese
FOOD	[ O  ]	Mine do
FOOD	[ fish ]	It's been 5 years since I've been here ya'll!  The last time I was here I bit down on what appeared to be a rusty piece of metal resembling a fish hook
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, because we like to live life on the edge we decided to go here again this last weekend
FOOD	[ noodle, dishes, strawberry, spinach, salad, blue cheese, bacon ]	I didn't have any noodle dishes this time though, I tried the strawberry spinach salad minus the blue cheese and bacon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was really, really good
FOOD	[ fig ]	 Everything tasted fresh and the balsamic fig dressing was delicious
FOOD	[ noodle, bowl, tofu, bowl ]	  My dining companion and the minor had the Indonesian noodle bowl with tofu, and the thai bowl
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 They both seemed to enjoy their dishes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Guess what?  No one got forked with a piece of metal this time!!!  Indications for going back look good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I go here all the time (about 4 times a month) and i have never had a bad meal or bad service
FOOD	[ Noodles ]	I love Noodles but this location is going downhill fast
FOOD	[ chicken ]	They undercook/ overlook my chicken every time
FOOD	[ noodles, sandwiches ]	They are also getting good at under boiling noodles!Food is always great tasting and ready in no time! Also they have a great variety of pastas and sandwiches
FOOD	[ flavor, Linguine, cream, tofu ]	 Can't say enough about how awesome this place is!Hidden vegan item bursting with flavor that even the most zealous carnivore could endure: Whole Grain Tuscan Linguine sans cream topped with tofu
FOOD	[ O  ]	Giggity
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you've not had the pleasure of sinking your chompers into their Ride Krispy Treat, you're not living life to the fullest
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm convinced the generous wedge of ooey gooey marshmallowy goodness is straight out of an angelic bake sale recipe book
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't want the secret - I just want them to never stop - ever
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think this might be the only place in the area that consistently gets my order right
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I always get take out so I can't speak to the dine-in experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My food is always fresh, the proper temperature, nicely packaged and correct
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This location in particular has been very pleasant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Highlights/lowlights 
FOOD	[ gluten ]	1) lots of gluten free options
FOOD	[ O  ]	2) quick
FOOD	[ Noodles, gluten, free lunch ]	Noodles and Company may not come to mind immediately when you are looking for a fast gluten free lunch or dinner
FOOD	[ Noodles ]	well it should! Noodles and Co
FOOD	[ rice, noodles ]	Offers rice noodles   
FOOD	[ gluten, corn, pasta ]	And gluten free corn pasta
FOOD	[ dishes, rice, noodles, pasta, macaroni, cheese, gluten ]	Oh the possibilities! You can substitute most of the regular dishes with the rice noodles or g free pasta (not the macaroni and cheese though as the sauce has gluten)
FOOD	[ gluten ]	The pad thai is gluten free as is so you don't even need to make substitutions
FOOD	[ flavor ]	This location has one of those awesome soda machines with every coke product flavor you can dream of 
FOOD	[ diet, cherry ]	Bring on the diet cherry coke!
FOOD	[ O  ]	The East Towne location service was really friendly, however there were tons of dirty tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	I understand not cleaning them as quickly when you are slow (I was there for dinner around 8:30pm on a week night) but 7-8 dirty tables with nobody walking around to clean them is kind of gross as the location is small
FOOD	[ gluten ]	Overall not a bad place for a quick lunch or dinner with plenty of gluten free options
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grabbed lunch here while passing thru while out of town
FOOD	[ Noodles ]	Good service, and the fare I've come to expect from Noodles locations
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can finally say that I've been to the elusive Eagle's Crest in the sticks of northeast Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Two days later, I am still struggling to digest the burger I consumed on Sunday morning
FOOD	[ beef, bacon, cheese ]	They don't even glamorize this real-deal burger with 16oz beef, 8 strips bacon and a think layer of melty cheese for $8
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't even see how they make money
FOOD	[ O  ]	Is it the best burger in Madison? I don't think so
FOOD	[ meat ]	It's not very well seasoned and the massive amount of meat is hard to handle
FOOD	[ O  ]	Is it an adventure in fun townie bar that has good cocktails? Yes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Horrible service
FOOD	[ Taco ]	We went for "Taco Tuesday
FOOD	[ O  ]	"  We waited for nearly 15 minutes before walking up to the bar to ask if we could get some service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 "I thought you were helped" the lady grunted at me as she took our order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She was the only bar keep in the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Must have an Alzheimer's style memory
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nearly 10 minutes later our drinks showed up
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We witnessed others get their food that had ordered after we did
FOOD	[ taco, Taco ]	 We ordered the taco special, so being "Taco Tuesday," one would think these would be readily available
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finally after 1/2 hour, we got our food tossed on the table
FOOD	[ glasses ]	 The personable waitress didn't notice our drinks were empty, so I had to walk the glasses to the bar to get them refilled
FOOD	[ O  ]	 While waiting quietly, some Harley- riding local came in and he was greeted like royalty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He barged right in front of me and he got served pronto
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bar tender went to him like files to a fresh pile of doo
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Thanks
FOOD	[ hygiene ]	Looks like the only way you'll get served here is if you are known by the employees, ride a Harley, have more tattoos than stripper convention or poor hygiene
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	At  $5
FOOD	[ taco ]	75 for a taco, the price was awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'd go back if it weren't for the lousy service
FOOD	[ taco ]	 Maybe I should buy  a new Electra-Glide next time I want a taco
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place was gross and depressing
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We live nearby, but I will avoid ever going back
FOOD	[ Taco ]	 We went to Taco Tuesday and were greeted with horrible service and even worse food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I did not come here expecting anything nice or classy, so even with low expectations I left feeling slightly down and depressed from this sad place
FOOD	[ O  ]	I try to not speak like a rapper, but "haters gonna hate
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seriously, this place is a dive bar, not a high-end french restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The servers sometimes double as bartenders
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You do not go to this place for the fast service, that is what people made McDonald's for
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You go for the 1lb
FOOD	[ O  ]	burgers!  They range from $7-$8
FOOD	[ O  ]	 How do they make money?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Is it the best burger?  No
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Is it in the top 5 of burgers that I have eaten?  Yes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Definitely
FOOD	[ bun, choice ]	 Everything is well thought out right down the to the bun choice
FOOD	[ kettle, chips ]	 The burgers all come with kettle chips
FOOD	[ kettle, chips ]	 I hate kettle chips
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Hate them
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You know what?  I ate theirs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yeah, the service took awhile, but you do not go to a dive bar to get out of there fast
FOOD	[ onions, onions ]	 The server was friendly and precise (I did not want onions, I did not get onions)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That care barely be said about high end restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was nice to sit back and relax and then the burger came
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They are huge
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	 I had a cheeseburger
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I barely made it through half
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They are cooked medium well, but they are still so juicy
FOOD	[ vegetables ]	 The vegetables are fresh and generous
FOOD	[ tomato ]	 I had two pieces of tomato large enough that one covered the burger
FOOD	[ bacon, cheeseburger ]	My friend had the bacon cheeseburger
FOOD	[ bacon ]	 I could barely see the burger under the bacon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I dared not try that on my first time out
FOOD	[ ham, cheese ]	I can not wait to try their hot ham and cheese
FOOD	[ ham ]	 It comes with two HUGE slices of ham
FOOD	[ brunch ]	 They have brunch on Sundays
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I am talking myself down from finding any excuse to go there again
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are craving a massive bar burger from a towny bar, this is the place to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	The burgers are so large that you should plan on cutting it in half and take the other half home
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are excellent!
FOOD	[ bacon, bacon ]	If you order the bacon burger, you can expect at least 6 plus long stripes on bacon on it, I was completely amazed with the quantity and quality of the burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	Amazing
FOOD	[ Taco ]	I have also been to the Eagle Crest on Taco Tuesday
FOOD	[ taco ]	Prepare yourself for the largest taco you will ever see
FOOD	[ taco salad, chips ]	If you order the taco salad they give you a very large plate stacked high with chips and all the fixings
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's great
FOOD	[ O  ]	More than any one person can eat in one sitting
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a bar people! Don't expect proper waitress service, the bar tenders are serving you most of the time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just be happy that this particular bar has amazing food
FOOD	[ Bloody Mary ]	Since this is a bar, maybe the best Bloody Mary in town
FOOD	[ shrimp, beef, pickle, olives ]	It comes in a large mug with 2 huge shrimp, a beef stick, pickle, and green olives
FOOD	[ O  ]	A meal in itself
FOOD	[ O  ]	If your hungry and don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the place I would suggest
FOOD	[ O  ]	My new favorite bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had gone to Eagles crest for lunch a few times and decided to take my family, from out of town, one weekend
FOOD	[ O  ]	When we arrived, there was a sign on the front door saying that it was customer appreciation day
FOOD	[ O  ]	We Bought a round of drinks and found a table to sit at
FOOD	[ O  ]	Other patrons were going through the food line which was set up at the pool table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But my sister-in-law went To get a veggie plate, One of the female staff came from around the bar and slapped the plate out of her hand And told us that we were not welcome there
FOOD	[ O  ]	We finished our drinks and left
FOOD	[ O  ]	As we were leaving we checked the sign on door again to see if it was marked private party, but it was not
FOOD	[ O  ]	After that experience I will never go back to Eagles Crest
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum, yum, yum
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I felt the need to update the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nothing has changed and that is what I love!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Consistency is appreciate when the quality is so high
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I appreciate that their burgers are as special, juicy and flavorful as always
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They are not trying to dress up the place or make things so fancy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The truth is, they stick to good, simply and quality food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So thank you for staying the same and staying fabulous
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was atrocious
FOOD	[ O  ]	We're en route from Baraboo to Chicago and had a group of 7
FOOD	[ O  ]	Though it was Memorial Day, the restaurant wasn't packed yet we waited 25 minutes for a table
FOOD	[ O  ]	Another 20 before our orders were taken and drinks brought
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant itself was truly filthy - stained, disgusting carpet and very poor layout so patrons are walking through service areas
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not cool
FOOD	[ O  ]	Should have gone to Log Cabin in Baraboo
FOOD	[ beverages ]	when we got there we ask for a couple minutes to decide on food and beverages
FOOD	[ O  ]	after the server had not come back for 25 mins we left
FOOD	[ O  ]	Your food is not that great so customer service should be where you shine
FOOD	[ O  ]	just a tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will never return to this location
FOOD	[ O  ]	Two adults and one kid equals a 40 dollar meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's not like we ordered everything on the menu either
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The kid had pancakes and a drink, the adults each had an omelet and one drink
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The pancakes were great, but the omelets were super salty, and the ingredients were the furthest thing from fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service was horrible
FOOD	[ rush ]	 They kept forgetting things, and it felt like they were trying to rush us out the door, even though there was only one other table there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Another reviewer mentioned having to walk through a service area, and it's true
FOOD	[ O  ]	 To get to the bathrooms you have to walk through a narrow service area that seems awkward
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The bathrooms were nasty dirty, next time I'll just hold it
FOOD	[ food poisoning ]	To top it off I got food poisoning and spent the rest of the day suffering immensely
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thanks International House of Poop!!!Too institutional
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Out of a can, bag, box, or freezer
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Parking is very limited
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not a fan
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's old
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's small
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The staff was attentive
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food showed up quick and tasted like IHOP food
FOOD	[ O  ]	TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT! - Over a year after I quit working at this IHOP because of terrible management
FOOD	[ O  ]	I called in a to-go order for my boyfriend and I - When I got there, I ended up having issues with my debit card so I ended up running across the street to pull money out of the bank
FOOD	[ O  ]	When I got back, I asked Jenelle, the manager, if I could have my food warmed up cause it was cold and she approached me with an atrocious attitude, and told me nope and walked off
FOOD	[ O  ]	So I said, alright, forget it, and left the $30
FOOD	[ O  ]	00 in food and walked out the door
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will never eat there again because I've come to the conclusion that there food gets cold and hard almost immediately
FOOD	[ O  ]	Though there are some very good breakfast places closer to our home, my husband is enamored of IHOP pancakes
FOOD	[ O  ]	So when we get coupons in the Sunday paper we come here for breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	They underwent some sort of change last year
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place closed down, then seemed to reopen almost immediately - hiring new people (judging by the help wanted sign on the marquee) and redecorating
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decor is bland and unremarkable - standard American Chain Restaurant style
FOOD	[ O  ]	We never had any problems with the food before (we go maybe four times a year)
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is still fine
FOOD	[ crepes, lingonberry ]	I personally wish they had more crepes on the menu but will survive with my lingonberry sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	As others have mentioned, you do need to walk through a narrow wait station on the way to some of the tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't like this, but the staff all seem used to it and so it isn't the worst thing ever
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never used the restroom so can't comment on that
FOOD	[ conversation ]	So my family and I are trying to enjoy our meals while a group of customers on the other side of the incredibly small dining room are having a loud conversation, taking calls via their cell phone speakers, and listening to YouTube videos on their phones
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I tell our server about it and the manager is then informed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When the manager walks past the group to investigate, they're not being noisy so nothing is said
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The noise then picks up again and our server comes by to drop off our check
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We're told that our meal is comped by 50%, which I'll obviously take, but that nothing was being done about the noise because the manager didn't hear anything
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So my complaint was without merit and the loud group shouldn't have been told that other customers were complaining about the noise they were making?!  What an incompetent manager!  The food was merely meh
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Other than the noise issue, our server was fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	Neighborhood delivery and takeout great
FOOD	[ O  ]	certainly a step higher than the other chains in this level
FOOD	[ O  ]	They don't biast 305-stars for Papa John's? Am I crazy?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Probably
FOOD	[ O  ]	But it really is worth of the rating
FOOD	[ O  ]	Why?
FOOD	[ O  ]	- So easy to order online; brilliantly intuitive and logical
FOOD	[ O  ]	- The inside of the store is spotless - I've never seen it in disarray
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Staff is friendly and efficient
FOOD	[ pizza ]	- Consistent quality; there's no hoping the pizza is as good as a previous time - it just is
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Never greasy
FOOD	[ pizza ]	- Quite possibly the best "well done thin crust" pizza I've ever had in the Madison area
FOOD	[ O  ]	It holds-up without flopping over, even when piping hot, and it's always perfectly cooked, without being burned or overly charred
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not a fan of their commercials or PJ's personal philosophies
FOOD	[ O  ]	That said, I have yet to find a better thin crust in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll keep looking, though
FOOD	[ pizza ]	Papa John's is great pizza! Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to get it delivered
FOOD	[ O  ]	After calling the store I was informed the front door of my residence was past the delivery boundary
FOOD	[ O  ]	My back door is adjacent to the street they deliver to
FOOD	[ O  ]	Didn't matter to the phone operator and never even considered finding a way to make it work
FOOD	[ O  ]	The employee's response, "the boundary has to be set somewhere" works in theory unfortunately this customer lives in reality
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really disappointed with the service being offered
FOOD	[ feet ]	I understand there are policies but being 20 feet past an arbitrary boundary is absurd
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thanks Papa!!Standard Chinese fare done well with very friendly service and quick orders to go (typically 15 minutes max)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If the menu were more interesting this would be a 4-star joint
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 Nevertheless, the dishes are great values, so I come by fairly often for pickup
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A large order of one dish lasts me two nights
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grade: B-
FOOD	[ O  ]	Aside from the sub zero restaurant temp and the scary-looking Mongolian Warriors (just out of the time machine) belching loudly while dining, this food was good and inexpensive
FOOD	[ O  ]	Personally, my favorite chinese food place in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have excellent food, excellent service, large portions (which are awesome reheated at home) and inexpensive!  I love it!  My only complaint is that it is always freezing in there!Got some take-out from there based on the reviews on this site
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Quite expensive and very low quality, like what one would expect from the crummy delivery places around here but not delivered and costing as much a a nice meal other places
FOOD	[ soup, buffet ]	 I usually think the 'good' chinese places have decent hot and sour soup, this stuff was the thick inedible slop straight out of a cheap buffet
FOOD	[ O  ]	I dunno if I was expecting too much but this certainly did not deliver
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quality is consistent and prices are more than fair
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff is very kind and accommodating
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's our go to Chinese carry-out
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wouldn't say it's the most authentic, but then again, it's delicious and cheap!Owners Lon and Wong are super (and always there, which makes it consistent)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ambiance and winter heating are lacking, but the food is always hot and good
FOOD	[ O  ]	A jewel of a place in a town with few decent Chinese restuarants
FOOD	[ tofu ]	Excellent Ma-Po tofu, I usually do not order this because of how simple it is to make at home, but was very glad that I did
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is always extremely good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Speaking of which, the waitress I have had both times I visited is one of the best wait staff I have had anywhere, including much pricier venues
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices are great and everything I have tried is very well done
FOOD	[ O  ]	Friendly staff and quick service but, unfortunately they couldn't make up for the unappetizing dining room and BLAND food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'll  be shopping around for another Chinese place
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place was recommended to me as some of the best Chinese food in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Totally agree!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went here for a Wednesday lunch at 2 pm and I was the only person there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I don't mean to be stereotypical, but if you've ever walked into an empty Chinese restaurant in the mid afternoon
FOOD	[ O  ]	you're probably going to have to make your presence known by ringing a bell or yelling an awkward "hello" towards the kitchen
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not in this case, I was promptly greeted and offered to sit anywhere
FOOD	[ O  ]	My food was excellent
FOOD	[ general tso's chicken ]	 Nothing daring, just general tso's chicken
FOOD	[ flavor ]	Good sauce, good flavor, good consistency
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lunch doesn't get any better at $4
FOOD	[ rice, soup ]	95 which includes an entree, rice, and soup!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Summary: friendly service, awesome food, good prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'll be back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really great Chinese food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Something about this restaurant gives you the impression that the cooks and staff really care about your food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything is delicious and there's a sense that it's more 'homemade' than other Chinese restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've only eaten in Wong's a few times
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really prefer to get the takeout
FOOD	[ onions ]	They are very nice about making substitutions (I hate onions!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I gotta say that the food from this restaurant is really good and the service is very nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	I came here and  a lady served me and she also was very attentive
FOOD	[ O  ]	Price is always good when you're student
FOOD	[ O  ]	Zoinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	You know how you drive by a place over and over and think
FOOD	[ O  ]	"Man why haven't I tried that!" Weeeeeeeeeeellllll it kills me to say but sometimes it's for the best
FOOD	[ O  ]	After tripping up and down Atwood for 5 months going from here to there, I finally bit the bullet and gave them a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	While the woman (owner I assume) helping me was lovely, the food was all Wong
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sorry
FOOD	[ Bean sprout, chop suey, choice, flavor, peanut butter, egg, foo young ]	Bean sprout overload populated the chop suey (a safe choice I thought because its so standard), the eggroll lacked flavor outside of the peanut butter used to seal it and the egg foo young which was a guilty pleasure staple of carry out growing up made me feel GUILTY, like really guilty for consuming it
FOOD	[ belly ]	Oily and in an all too rich sauce, it just didn't jive with my belly
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd say I will go back, but honestly I feel like I went pretty safe, pretty standard
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd be afraid to try again and branch out
FOOD	[ O  ]	This was decent for Chinese
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service was great and the people were friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However the food was run of the mill Chinese
FOOD	[ O  ]	My sister brought this great restaurant to my attention and I will forever be thankful
FOOD	[ O  ]	She's been coming here for several years so I knew that this place had something going for it, and boy it really did
FOOD	[ general tso's chicken, chicken, chow mein ]	For our lunch stop, we ordered the general tso's chicken, kung pao chicken, and the house special chow mein
FOOD	[ O  ]	All were above average, but the general was beyond expectations
FOOD	[ chicken ]	The breaded chicken pieces were out of this world-- soft, pillowy (yes pillowy) and simply addicting with each bite
FOOD	[ general tso's chicken, dishes, chicken ]	If you're into Chinese like I am, you know that many general tso's chicken dishes tend to be overly breaded, crusty, and include questionable chicken parts rolled into one
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not this place! You gotta check it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	As for the kung pao & house special, they both could have had more umff and kick to it, but good nonetheless
FOOD	[ dishes ]	The only thing we worried about as we enjoyed our 3 dishes was the lack of patrons
FOOD	[ O  ]	We got here just before 2pm on a Wednesday and there was only one customer and a few pickup orders
FOOD	[ O  ]	What's the dealio Madison? I've been to nearly all the Chinese joints in Madison and this place for sure ranks pretty high
FOOD	[ O  ]	To our assurance, the lady owner said they were swamped the other day so that made us feel slightly better
FOOD	[ O  ]	Besides the great food, their prices are more than reasonable and the service is genuinely inviting
FOOD	[ O  ]	The lunch menu doesn't include anything over $5
FOOD	[ rice, soup ]	95, which includes an entree, rice, and soup
FOOD	[ O  ]	The lady owner (who recognized my sister from previous visits) talked with us for quite some time and enjoyed playing with my baby nephew while we ate
FOOD	[ O  ]	All in all, a great visit that will definitely make me come back for more
FOOD	[ O  ]	^^We moved to the atwood area about a year ago, and have visited Wongs several times
FOOD	[ O  ]	It does not have an ambiance to write home about, but the food has been consistently good: flavorful, not greasy and very reasonable portions and prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	The owners/staff are all very nice and friendly too
FOOD	[ date ]	Its not a place to bring a hot date, but for a nice quick meal its a great spot
FOOD	[ Bread, coffee ]	Think Panera Bread with more of a coffee shop feel
FOOD	[ coffee ]	If you like light to medium roast coffee this is the place to be
FOOD	[ O  ]	I couldn't find better one on east side of Madison in last few years with the same consistency
FOOD	[ O  ]	Always not too slow not too busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can hear another person if you are not alone
FOOD	[ O  ]	Never had a problem
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had lunch once, if I remember correct it was on ok side
FOOD	[ O  ]	Plenty of free parking
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was prompt with a smile
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Everytime I went while visiting Madison the coffee was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	They either have an excellent roaster, or train their staff really well (or both)
FOOD	[ coffee, coffee ]	I  like my coffee to taste like coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not the sugary, foo foo, macha frappa jacka whatever
FOOD	[ coffee ]	So if you believe that coffee roasting is an art and not a fad, check this place out
FOOD	[ O  ]	It has a great energy too
FOOD	[ date ]	Local art and jewelry designers are supported there and there is a cozy fireplace! Good post movie date spotThis place is OUTSTANDING! It is the perfect location to meet up with friends or go to by yourself
FOOD	[ O  ]	The noise level is perfect not too loud
FOOD	[ O  ]	not to quiet
FOOD	[ sugar, caribou ]	Plus, besides the great selection of drinks (especially sugar-free) they also have a wide selection of food unparalleled to starbucks or caribou
FOOD	[ O  ]	Happy Sipping!We really like this place
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 Cozy, fireplace, really good coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Some nice paintings on the wall but the one is a myth
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It shows Monona Terrace with the sun setting nearby
FOOD	[ O  ]	 ( I think it is the sun- I forget)  Anyway, the terrace sits toward the north and it would be pretty tough to paint the sun there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Other than that it is a good painting
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The painting of downtown Madison in the rain is fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I wonder if I could buy that one?
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Enjoy the coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	So I was in Madison the other day picking up my carpooler near the East Town Mall and I admit
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was trying to find anything that would give me a caffeine buzz
FOOD	[ O  ]	okay I admit it, I was seeking out a Starbucks because at this point
FOOD	[ O  ]	Anything will do!! 
FOOD	[ Coffee, Coffee, bagel ]	I Yelped Coffee Shops nearby and got this little gem! Too cute! Coffee was awesome and also got a bagel to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	The scene inside was comfy and cozy, too bad I had to jet, otherwise I would have enjoyed sipping on my java inside instead of on the highway! I am happy I know about this place tucked back off the well beaten path!Staff did not acknowledge us in any way until we ordered, and were unable to answer basic questions about their products
FOOD	[ chicken, salad, sandwich ]	We ordered a chicken salad sandwich; it was adequate, but I've had better
FOOD	[ kettle, chips, pasta salad, penne, noodles, oregano ]	It was accompanied by a small bag of off-brand kettle chips and a tiny plastic sample cup full of "pasta salad", which was just some tough, flavorless penne noodles sprinkled with oregano
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	I expect a side dish accompanying a sandwich to be small, but seriously, a sample cup? Maybe it was intended to be decorative
FOOD	[ fruit, banana ]	We also had a "classic" smoothie, which was supposed to be made with real fruit and contain strawberries, banana and orange
FOOD	[ orange juice ]	It was decent, but so heavy on cheap orange juice that it overpowered the other flavors
FOOD	[ O  ]	Aside from the disappointing food and lack of service, it seemed to be a nice enough space
FOOD	[ O  ]	They had some distinctive furniture and a variety of seating, including both a bar and comfy chairs around a fireplace; a private room in the back available for reservation; and a large outdoor patio featuring a sandbox for the kids
FOOD	[ coffee ]	The food seemed over-priced for the quality, but overall the pricing was competitive with other cafes in the area; while I can't recommend it for lunch, the patio might be a good place for parents to meet for coffee while their kids play in the sandbox
FOOD	[ O  ]	Honestly, I can't see any other reason to come here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have lunch here all the time
FOOD	[ burrito, sandwich ]	The veggie wrap, Greek breakfast burrito and the caprese sandwich are terrific
FOOD	[ coffee ]	They serve great local coffee and desserts too
FOOD	[ O  ]	The meeting room in the back can be reserved for small groups (say 10-15)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Friendly staff and locally owned
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Great coffee, amazing atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is also really really good!!Healthy lunch items on the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Quiches are delicious, hot, but not made to order
FOOD	[ beverage, coffee, mocha, hot chocolate ]	 Can be a little pricey on the beverage side ($3-5 for lattes, coffee, mocha, or hot chocolate)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Urban interior with cozy surroundings
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Snuggle up to the fireplace or find a table or up top counter to plug in the computer
FOOD	[ Chai, Latte ]	 I like the mix of people and the free WiFi while sipping on a Hot Chai Latte
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Kiddie area outside and inside
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Patio area in summer is nice but not shaded
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Back room area is great for 10-15 people and can be reserved
FOOD	[ Beans ]	Cool Beans saved my Christmas vacation!
FOOD	[ holidays, Beans ]	While in town visiting family over the holidays, my hubby and I found Cool Beans
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was our refuge as we endured the stresses of visiting family
FOOD	[ coffee ]	The coffee and food is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The 3-way fireplace is awesome!  What a terrific place to hang out, not be bothered, and work on the computer
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The staff is friendly the place is clean and inviting
FOOD	[ Beans ]	The East Side has needed a place like this for a long time, and I'm glad that Cool Beans has finally filled that niche
FOOD	[ O  ]	The next time we're in town, we'll make sure to stop in for a cuppa Joe
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Absolutely best coffee in Madison, topped with a healthy serving of excellent service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ambiance is perfect for studying (this is, in fact, my second home), hanging out with friends, reading a book by the fire, or conducting a business meeting
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have an excellent assortment of drinks (caffeinated and not) and food
FOOD	[ cookie, coffee ]	Skip the poor-tasting, cookie-cutter Starbucks and experience some real coffee made by people who actually take pride in their job
FOOD	[ latte ]	and check out the latte art before you put your lid on--they're getting good! :)Good food, comfy environment
FOOD	[ Beans ]	Cool Beans
FOOD	[ O  ]	Neato
FOOD	[ O  ]	Far out
FOOD	[ O  ]	When did speech become so convoluted with things like verbs and syntax? 
FOOD	[ Beans ]	Lucky for us, Cool Beans on the east side keeps it real
FOOD	[ O  ]	in more ways than one
FOOD	[ O  ]	First off, the seating is plentiful, and when you add a cool outside space during the warmer months, there's no shortage of real estate if your going at it solo or in a huge group
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's even a back room that looks like it can be closed off with a set of doors
FOOD	[ Coffee, tea, brew ]	Coffee and tea are what you'd expect, not the best brew I've had in town, but certainly not the worst
FOOD	[ O  ]	But it's their food options that blew me away originally
FOOD	[ cafe, soup, salad, sandwich ]	They really take the whole "cafe" thing to a new level with a plentiful amount of soup, salad and sandwich options to satisfy anyone
FOOD	[ O  ]	Think Panera, but much better
FOOD	[ O  ]	Much much better
FOOD	[ minestrone, jerk, sandwich ]	The particular day I was there I dug into some minestrone and a half of a jerk sandwich served up on a toasted pita
FOOD	[ O  ]	Both were quite tasty
FOOD	[ chat ]	Add some free WIFI and decadent looking pastries and you have the makings for a pretty nifty spot for chit-chat, laptop'n or busting out the bridge set
FOOD	[ O  ]	People still do that, right?This is a great place to study or to get your post-workout smoothie!
FOOD	[ O  ]	The ambiance is great for studying, just loud enough to keep me from feeling antsy and quiet enough that I don't get annoyed by other patrons
FOOD	[ cafe, balance, coffee ]	This is possibly the best cafe for a balance of coffee and food
FOOD	[ coffee ]	I would actually eat here, as opposed to most coffee shops
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really, 90% of the time I'd rather starve than eat the stale baked goods
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, right next to Princeton Club
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very nice atmosphere
FOOD	[ White chocolate, macadamia nut, latte, Beans, Cafe ]	The White chocolate macadamia nut latte was awesome!There are a lot of things I liked about Cool Beans Cafe
FOOD	[ O  ]	- It's local and not a chain 
FOOD	[ collage, coffee ]	- The post it note collage reading material provided for you while you wait for your coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	- The featured non-profit highlighted on the back table on the way to the restrooms
FOOD	[ O  ]	-The three sided fireplace
FOOD	[ O  ]	-The local artists work and jewelry for sale 
FOOD	[ coffee ]	However, I find the coffee overpriced for the quality
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Cozy and fun coffee shop
FOOD	[ sandwich, chai, tea ]	I've had a sandwich and chai tea a few times with a friend here
FOOD	[ coffee, cups ]	I have bought two of their coffee cups and I love them
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great place to chill out on a cold day
FOOD	[ Beans ]	I have been to Cool Beans a couple of times thanks to a co-worker
FOOD	[ coffee ]	This is a great place to grab a cup of coffee with a friend or meet for a work meeting
FOOD	[ coffee ]	The coffee is great and I usually buy the endless cup as I stay for a couple of hours
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is great as well
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	The sandwiches are definitely something to try
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is cozy
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are tables and chairs throughout and then there are some comfy chairs if looking for a more relaxed seat
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are in Madison on the East Side this a great place to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is cute, very comfortable inside and the staff is really nice :)
FOOD	[ sandwich, white chocolate, mocha, cafe, cafe ]	I got a breakfast sandwich and a white chocolate mocha both were so delicious!! skip the starbucks and head over here, I would highly recommend this place!Another great local cafe found by the power of yelp! This cafe is right by the major highways and was on my way driving through IL
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its on your right side after you turn into the street and the sign is easy to find
FOOD	[ chat ]	This place has lots of seating, a great big fireplace in the middle with couches around it makes the environment very inviting to sit down and chat with friends/coworkers
FOOD	[ mocha, whipped cream, coffee ]	I tried an iced mocha with whipped cream topped, they offer their coffee in 3 sizes
FOOD	[ mocha, chocolate, croissant ]	With my iced mocha I also ordered a chocolate croissant
FOOD	[ dessert, tiramisu ]	Both were delicious and there were so many different choices in dessert that i want to try! Next time Im in the area I am definetly going to have to try their tiramisu!!This place may be out by the mall, but it is one of my favorite places to write in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff here are amazingly helpful
FOOD	[ coffee, Gluten, bread ]	The coffee is fabulous (locally roasted), the food is fresh and tasty, and (even though it isnt advertised) they have Gluten-Free bread!!!! :)  They even have a separate meeting/gathering room
FOOD	[ Beans ]	Love!I was on the east side for the evening and saw Cool Beans
FOOD	[ O  ]	I remembered I had a coupon and decided to try them out
FOOD	[ choice, Turtle, latte ]	The staff was helpful in making my choice of drink, I got the Turtle latte
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was so amazing and the girl and the guy who were working there were friendly as could be
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will be going back! Worth checking out
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	Fresh ingredients! I had the grilled veggie sandwich
FOOD	[ pesto ]	It was good but next time I'll ask if they can throw some pesto on it as well
FOOD	[ chicken, pesto, flavor ]	Had a bite of my husband's grilled chicken pesto and can't get the flavor out of my mind
FOOD	[ O  ]	mmm
FOOD	[ Beans ]	I love stopping at Cool Beans for a quick work-day lunch! It's one of my favorite places to bring a friend when we're meeting up during the work week
FOOD	[ sandwich, salad ]	Their food is great and made fresh - I've never had a bad dish here, but my favorite is the grilled vegetable sandwich with the side salad
FOOD	[ coffee ]	I am also a big fan of their coffee drinks
FOOD	[ Hazelnut ]	Hazelnut lattes are my go-to
FOOD	[ cafe ]	Great little cafe!!!Monty's is a Madison favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Breakfast all day
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Fantastic comfort food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Friendly service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Veggie options
FOOD	[ O  ]	 While nothing spectacular, it's consistently pretty damn tasty
FOOD	[ Meatloaf ]	 Of note: popular breakfast (expect to wait) and the Meatloaf of the Gods
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great old school diner with some tasty comfort food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Honestly, I can't see what the fuss is all about with Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's certainly a staple of the Madison community, and the food is decent, but I find it overpriced, and the waits too long for the quality of the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Classic diner feel gives it a slight bump, but really, I think it's an average place, with average food
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	This diner offers an unexpectedly large number of vegetarian options, including a fantastic "Sheldon" sandwich--their veggie analog to the Rueben
FOOD	[ fries ]	 Fresh hot fries would have nudged this rating to five stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yeah, it's nice there are a lot of veggie options, but I feel like they are spreading themselves too thin
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No one I went with was really impressed with their food, and the weird thing was that the waitress brought out half the table's food, making a few people wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Anyone who's been a waitress knows not to do that
FOOD	[ tempeh, seitan, tofu, menus ]	 I do appreciate tempeh, seitan and tofu on menus, but it would be nice if they did it well
FOOD	[ O  ]	Having heard only good things, I had pretty high expectations for Monty's but I felt let down by the service and really let down by the food
FOOD	[ chicken, pie, salmon ]	The meals ordered, chicken in a pie and salmon cakes were both luke-warm and tasted like they had lived under a warming lamp for quite some time
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place it not worth the reputation
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are definitely hits and misses at Monty's
FOOD	[ meatloaf, carrot, curry, soup, salmon, salad ]	As a pesco vegetarian, I appreciate a restaurant where I have more than 3-5 options The hits would include the vegetarian meatloaf dinner, carrot curry soup, the salmon ceasar salad, almost all of their baked goods, and almost all of their breakfast items
FOOD	[ O  ]	The misses include the vegetarian reuben (called the Sheldon), it's just too dry
FOOD	[ BLT ]	 Ditto on the vegetarian BLT
FOOD	[ brunch ]	 The waits at weekend brunch and lunch time are long
FOOD	[ O  ]	 At times, I have experienced legendary slow service so dine with only people you can stand being around for 2 hours or more
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Despite the negative, I enjoy it, and I  take people who are new to Madison here, and they love it too
FOOD	[ meatloaf ]	Old school -- I enjoyed the meatloaf and there are some really great options if you are dining with a vegetarian
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grade; C-
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't understand why people make such a big deal out of this below-average place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lemmings
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food Fight Inc
FOOD	[ O  ]	fools Madison yet again
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't believe the hype
FOOD	[ O  ]	Strengths: 
FOOD	[ O  ]	-easy parking
FOOD	[ O  ]	-outdoor patio
FOOD	[ O  ]	-vegetarian-friendly menu
FOOD	[ coffee ]	-attentive service and unending coffee refills
FOOD	[ O  ]	-air conditioning
FOOD	[ O  ]	-proximity to bike paths
FOOD	[ O  ]	-lots of comfy booths
FOOD	[ O  ]	Weaknesses: 
FOOD	[ gluten, sauces ]	-they could only *almost* find the gluten-free menu and weren't sure what was in some of the sauces
FOOD	[ O  ]	-the women's bathroom was about 120 degrees and stuffy
FOOD	[ gluten ]	-desert options looked non-existent for the gluten-free crowd, though I didn't look very closely
FOOD	[ brunch, coffee ]	It was still a fun place to have brunch with a friend, even if I ended up drinking way too much coffee
FOOD	[ omelette ]	 I had an omelette and it was fairly standard
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Apparently people say it's overpriced for Madison, though since I live in San Francisco, I'm not really one to say
FOOD	[ gluten ]	I would have happily given another point if only the staff could have found the gluten-free menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	We went here for breakfast on a Sunday
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was very crowded, but we only had to wait 20-30 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not gonna lie, some of the staff seem incompetent, but they are nice in general
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am giving it 3 because:
FOOD	[ O  ]	-Cool, old style, but generic diner interior
FOOD	[ O  ]	-Reasonable prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	-Food was decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	-Crowd was good, chill
FOOD	[ meat ]	-there were a good number of veg options, but not too many for us meat eaters (yum)It is about the most vegetarian-friendly diner I've ever known
FOOD	[ tofu, waffle, fries ]	Some things on the menu are stellar -- like the tofu wrap and the yummy waffle fries -- and others are so-so
FOOD	[ O  ]	Is suppose that, as far as "diner" food goes, it's better than average, but you're not really paying "diner" prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff always seems sort of out of it and not thrilled to interact with customers
FOOD	[ O  ]	We regularly wait long stretches to get some attention from our server once we are sat
FOOD	[ O  ]	But the faked-up old diner feels groovy and you always leave painfully full
FOOD	[ Blue Plate ]	My review would probably be higher, had I not just the other day had one of the worst meals of my life at Monty's Blue Plate diner
FOOD	[ meatloaf, sandwich ]	My meatloaf sandwich was so salty is almost inedible
FOOD	[ gravy, salt, meatloaf ]	At first I thought it was the gravy that had the excessive salt, then I figured it was the meatloaf
FOOD	[ salt, salt, beast ]	After plodding through this sodium-induced nightmare I realized that the whole damn thing was pure salt, like that one episode of the Original Series Star Trek, the one with the salt beast, that's made of pure sodium
FOOD	[ dishes ]	This place has a varied menu with a good selection of vegan or vegetarian dishes
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would recommend the Palomino or Comet in MIlwaukee, both vegan and vegetarian friendly diners, over this place any day of the week
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's is basically a shiny Denny's in the heart of Madison's Atwood neighborhood
FOOD	[ O  ]	 On the plus side, you won't leave the diner with an empty stomach
FOOD	[ potatoes, coffee ]	The portions are generous, potatoes seasoned just right and the servers keep your coffee fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's not worth waiting more than 30 minutes to sit, but smaller parties of 2 to 3 can get in relatively fast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Decent menu selection and the pies look good by the counter
FOOD	[ pie ]	but saving room for pie is a challenge
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have been going to Monty's for years and I have always had the same thing to say:  the service sucks
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is okay, I mean, it's a diner
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There is a wide variety of vegetarian options which is nice
FOOD	[ tuna, steak, sandwich, cajun, chicken, sandwich ]	 I also have to mention that I won't be eating here again soon as they have very recently taken my 2 favorite items off the menu; the tuna steak sandwich, and the cajun chicken sandwich
FOOD	[ cumin, chipotle, mayonnaise, tuna, sandwich ]	 The cumin chipotle mayonnaise on the tuna sandwich was one of the only reasons I would even still go to Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is always terrible
FOOD	[ O  ]	 you can count on a long wait for your waiter to take your order, for them to bring your drinks, and your food, and the longest wait of all is always for the check
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have contemplated a dine and dash many times
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I counted the minutes one time, and it was 45 minutes from the time I finished eating to when the check came
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It wasn't because the waitress didn't see me from behind the counter either, she was talking to another server
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Once, I was eating with a friend, and we were waiting for 15 minutes to even have our waiter come to the table, so we just left
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Believe me, the service being slow is never because there isn't enough servers or too many diners
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is decent, but it's not great by any means
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is still pretty okay, although I've had some bad meals
FOOD	[ meatloaf, cashew, gravy, salmon ]	 The meatless meatloaf is only saved by the cashew gravy, and the salmon cakes are awful
FOOD	[ tuna, sandwich, bun, pastrami, sandwiches ]	 The tuna sandwich was really good, but the size and bun has changed over the years, and recently been replaced by 3 kinds of pastrami sandwiches
FOOD	[ chicken, salad, feta, dill ]	  The grilled chicken salad is good, as is the feta dill burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never been even remotely let down by Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Is it busy a lot?  Yes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Are you probably going to have to wait 30 minutes to sit down?  Yes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Is the service slow because it's so busy?  Yes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've never been under the impression that the service is slow because they're incompetent, but just because they're busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Besides that, I've never noticed it being *especially* slow
FOOD	[ O  ]	just kind of slow, which doesn't really bother me
FOOD	[ Meatloaf, Sandwich ]	Let me take a moment here to recommend the Meatloaf Sandwich: Get it served cold
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Just trust me here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Do not get it hot
FOOD	[ sandwich, gravy, mashed potatoes ]	 I've had it served both ways: Cold, it is a sandwich so delicious that fireworks go off in your head; Warm, it is an open-faced abomination with gravy and mashed potatoes poured all over it
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	Their cheeseburger was surprisingly good (I'd even go so far to say that it's one of the best burgers I've had in Madison)
FOOD	[ Cheeseburger, Cheese ]	 They had a special entree one evening, "Cheeseburger Mac & Cheese," which was out of this world
FOOD	[ cheeseburger, noodles, chef, salad, waffle, fries, buttermilk, biscuits ]	 It really tasted like a cheeseburger over noodles!  They serve a great chef salad, have awesome spicy waffle fries, and I would die 100 times over for the buttermilk biscuits they serve with breakfast
FOOD	[ dessert ]	 Their expansive dessert case is as tasty as it is impressive looking
FOOD	[ german chocolate cake, dessert ]	I was beyond sold on this place one time when I ordered a piece of german chocolate cake for dessert
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It wasn't a piece so much as it was a towering slab
FOOD	[ chocolate ]	 It was so tall, in fact, that it wasn't until I'd eaten enough of it that I noticed that the waiter (who was wearing a mohawk and kilt) had written, "Das ist Deutsch" in chocolate on the plate
FOOD	[ pie, pie ]	I've had questionable service twice: Once was when I reserved a pie for a dinner I was going to and they did not have it when I got there, but tried to placate me by selling me a larger, more expensive pie
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for 20 minutes before I was finally helped
FOOD	[ coffee, dessert ]	 The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, "You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We don't see it on our paychecks for another 2 weeks otherwise
FOOD	[ O  ]	"  Um
FOOD	[ O  ]	thanks for the advice on how we should tip you
FOOD	[ O  ]	 How about we don't tip you at all?
FOOD	[ O  ]	But those two experiences aside, nothing has been able to lessen my love of Monty's and all its glory
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's used to be one of my favorite places on the near-east side
FOOD	[ Meatloaf ]	  I've long loved their Meatloaf of the Gods, fat and calories be damned
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, our last 5-6 experiences have been exercises in frustration, with such charming features as a $100 overcharge on my debit card for a $23 meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 (yes, you read that right)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Yes, the server was new, yes they corrected it, but still
FOOD	[ O  ]	We ate there again last night- I'm a firm believer in the power of the 19th chance-, only to leave with a renewed resolve that there are many better options available
FOOD	[ O  ]	What a cute little place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Doesn't seem like the smoothest run location
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food we were served was good and served as requested
FOOD	[ O  ]	they serve breakfast all day, which is really nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I thought the food was well priced and the service was efficient
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had just moved from Colorado, back here, to the midwest
FOOD	[ meatloaf ]	So of course, I ordered the meatloaf
FOOD	[ O  ]	I told the server that it was better than my mom's, and that's no hyperbole -- it's DAMN good!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will most certainly be coming back
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been in Madison for 10 days or so and I've made this observation: Madison residents are spoiled rotten! ROTTEN! There is nothing like Monty's back home in Boston
FOOD	[ O  ]	I dare all you haters visit its counterpart in Boston, the South Street Diner
FOOD	[ O  ]	Have a meal there and report back to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will have a hankie ready to wipe away your tears of disappointment
FOOD	[ sugar, french fries ]	At Monty's today, I accidentally dumped sugar all over my french fries
FOOD	[ fries ]	Even though I'm clearly a stupid klutz, they gave me new fries anyway
FOOD	[ chocolate, malt ]	My chocolate malt was perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	Once I slurped it all up, I felt a little sad
FOOD	[ malt ]	and then I discovered there was ANOTHER malt waiting for me and I felt like a winner!
FOOD	[ O  ]	And believe it or not, I'm a connoisseur of vegetarian reubens
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've tried them all over the country in CA, RI, MA, CT, NY and Monty's in the best I've ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food can be good here (not great but good) but the biggest problem for me is the AWFUL service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Somebody teach these people some customer service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I swear that the guy who waited on me the last time I was there was high
FOOD	[ blood ]	 The interminable waiting for refills on drinks and the check drove my blood pressure through the roof
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've determined that the secret to getting good service from anyone here is to be a hot looking college girl
FOOD	[ O  ]	 that seemed to keep the waiter's attention focused on the table next to mine
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Maybe she was one of the more positive posters here
FOOD	[ O  ]	We dont live on that side of town any more but when we do go there on a Sunday, we like to stop there for lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	And few times this summer even with gas price,we drove there for lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You cant leave there without trying one of their pies or cakes
FOOD	[ pie ]	Usually,I wont have room after the regular food so I end up taking home the pie
FOOD	[ O  ]	Never been there without having to wait for 20 minute or so
FOOD	[ O  ]	But it's all worth the wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	I just wish they make the place just a little bigger or do soemthing about the noise level
FOOD	[ meat, bean ]	 I'm a meat eatter but I tried their bean burger there and now that's all I eat there
FOOD	[ dessert ]	Besides the dessert
FOOD	[ O  ]	Breakfast places are generally my favorite types of places to dive into in new cities simply because breakfast is my favorite meal of the day
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd never been to Madison before and I must say it's a lovely city
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Of course we were there in late May when the temperature was a balmy 67 with nice breezes throughout
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's was good, very good, in fact
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So good that we went there 2 days in a row
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We were traveling with some vegetarians and they were able to find tasty eats on the menu as well
FOOD	[ eggs benedict, mornay ]	There was disappointment in their version of eggs benedict which had a mornay-type sauce that really tasted burnt
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Like burnt crap, actually
FOOD	[ mornay sauce ]	 Maybe I just don't like mornay sauce but ugh
FOOD	[ Coffee ]	Coffee was good, we tried some of their desserts and enjoyed the diner atmosphere from our cozy booth
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Well done, Madison, well done
FOOD	[ potato, pie ]	I love the vegetarian Rueben and stuffed myself with the potato pie, but I haven't been thrilled with my breakfast experiences here
FOOD	[ asparagus ]	 I had the Scrambled Something or Other on the day that it happened to have asparagus in it
FOOD	[ asparagus, eggs ]	 I never did find any asparagus, but the eggs turned a horrendous shade of gray
FOOD	[ potatoes, biscuit ]	 The potatoes were hardly cooked all the way through, but at least the biscuit was good
FOOD	[ Mornay sauce, sausage, gravy, Mornay sauce ]	 I'm convinced the Mornay sauce is sausage gravy - I used to live in France and never had Mornay sauce like the stuff at Monty's!  Still - I give the place props for having so many vegetarian options
FOOD	[ iceberg lettuce, salad, cheese ]	 It's fun to go out and have more to choose from than an iceberg lettuce salad or grilled cheese
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was in Madison overnight and ate at Monty's not once but twice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The vegetarian food was that good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Madison does not seem to have much in the way of vegetarian restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Monty's was at the top of the list when I did my research
FOOD	[ beat ]	 But the vegetarian menu at Monty's is pretty hard to beat, especially for a place that caters to carnivores as well (unusual)
FOOD	[ O  ]	  About half of the menu is vegetarian-friendly, with a couple of vegan items as well
FOOD	[ meatloaf, pie, tempeh, BLT ]	 The veggie meatloaf was the best of the food we ate (not including the pie), but the tempeh in the veggie BLT was nicely prepared too
FOOD	[ tofu ]	 We didn't try breakfast items, but tofu scrambler was available and looked great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food was delicious, the desserts were enormous and divine, and we thought the service was fast and friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We were there on a Sunday evening and a Monday lunch, and neither time did we wait for a table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a restaurant for both the carnivores and the herbivores, while satisfying both groups
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That's not easy to do, and Monty's did it well
FOOD	[ Loaf ]	This is my absolute favorite restaurant and anytime I come home for a visit I have to stop by to have some Meatless Loaf of the God's or a Gobbler!
FOOD	[ pie, cake ]	Top it all off with a Cup of Mud or an off the hook slice of pie or cake and you have one amazing meal that can only be found in Mad-town
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Has always been one of my favorite diners in Mad-town
FOOD	[ chili, cornbread ]	 Delicious veggie chili, spicy cornbread, malts and desserts, as well as the amazing array of other veggie options
FOOD	[ Quiche, fruit ]	 Just yesterday, I tried the new Spinoccoli Quiche with fruit, which was pretty darn good
FOOD	[ coffee ]	coffee is always hot and refills frequent
FOOD	[ zucchini ]	 Still have yet to try the famous zucchini pancakes, but next time, I must
FOOD	[ dessert ]	 I must also remember to save room for dessert!  Look forward to returning sooner than later to try some of the other new lunch options on the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Only downer is the wait/lack of parking on a busy day
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Overall, two thumbs up from me, Monty
FOOD	[ O  ]	I liked the 1950s-diner ambience of this joint
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was crowded and bustling when we went, though we didn't have to wait for a table, unlike people in larger groups
FOOD	[ brunch ]	It seems to be a popular weekend brunch spot
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was friendly and prompt and our waiter picked up that I was vegan (without me telling him) and helpfully told us that some things (such as the rolls) weren't dairy-free
FOOD	[ English muffins ]	He substituted toast and English muffins for us
FOOD	[ tofu, potato ]	I found my vegan tofu scramble with potato hash to be decent, but nothing spectacular
FOOD	[ sandwich, waffle, fries ]	My friend thought the same of his "Sloppy Faux" sandwich which came with waffle fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	The prices are reasonable at around $7-10 a dish and the portion sizes are good
FOOD	[ dishes, meatloaf ]	They do offer at least eight or nine vegan-friendly dishes from scrambles to burgers to meatloaf
FOOD	[ brunch, Blue Plate ]	Madison needs a place like this which offers vegan brunch foods so I appreciate Blue Plate is around
FOOD	[ O  ]	The vibe is good and they have parking
FOOD	[ O  ]	But the quality of the food could stand to improve a bit
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fun place!  Very hip!Dear Monty's,
FOOD	[ O  ]	I miss you so, so much out here in Boston
FOOD	[ pie, brunch, rush, Coffee ]	We've had quite the long-term relationship: from late-night pie after high school dances, to my stint as a busgirl/counter in the ever-important Sunday brunch rush, your old blue tshirts with "World's Best Coffee" on the back, to dinner before a show at the Barrymore, to my going back each time I'm in town to run into familiar faces
FOOD	[ O  ]	For years, Tim and Roma and a large posse have made this tiny former gas station a stalwart in the Madison dining scene
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's, you and the Barrymore have rejuvenated Atwood Ave
FOOD	[ zucchini, potato, mint, cheesecake, chocolate, ice cream ]	You, and your vegetarian comfort food, zucchini-potato pancakes, scrambled something-or-other, andes mint cheesecake, chocolate malts (don't ask how much ice cream goes into those, btw
FOOD	[ Chocolate, muffins, pumpkin ]	but it's all from the Chocolate Shoppe), muffins, pumpkin bars
FOOD	[ O  ]	I could go on and on
FOOD	[ O  ]	And how
FOOD	[ O  ]	For all of you lucky enough to reside around this place, please take advantage
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's nothing like it anywhere else
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sincerely,
FOOD	[ O  ]	AngelinaMonty's is awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Their vegetarian comfort food is great and there are lots of choices
FOOD	[ waffle, fries, sandwich ]	 Get the spicy waffle fries with your sandwich; they are not actually spicy, but they're delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I also love the milkshakes!I live down the road from Monty's and it's being in walking distance helps give it a half a star
FOOD	[ O  ]	I also tend to go at off-peak times which I think has helped me have a better experience (mid mornings on the weekends can get very crowded and you'll have a wait)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've tried many things here and have never had anything bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	Some things though were just meh
FOOD	[ french toast ]	I really enjoyed their french toast
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was big and fluffy on the inside and cooked just right on the outside
FOOD	[ egg, dishes ]	Their omelets and other egg dishes I've tried were pretty standard
FOOD	[ O  ]	The serving sizes are pretty big
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not a veg, but I appreciate that they had several options available for those who are
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall I think it's a fun place to take friends who are visiting from out of town before heading down to the farmer's market early on a Saturday morning
FOOD	[ brunch ]	I came here for brunch on a saturday
FOOD	[ Guacamole, lettuce, bacon, tomato ]	I got the GLBT: Guacamole, lettuce, bacon and tomato
FOOD	[ root beer ]	It was delicious! I love that this place serves Sprecher root beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seems like that's a standard for Madison, but I love it and I'm thrilled whenever I can order it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum! We also got one of their delicious pies to go, and it was killer
FOOD	[ O  ]	So even if you're full after breakfast or lunch, grab one of the desserts to go for later enjoyment
FOOD	[ O  ]	I thought service was good here; we got our food in a decent amount of time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Be warned, it can be hard to get to via car, since the street arrangement in that area is totally wacky
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, it's worth the hunt, since you get Monty's at the end
FOOD	[ botanical ]	Now that the weather is nice, check out the botanical gardens afterwards, since it's close to this restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Another one of my weekend staples
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's is the best diner in Madison--mainly because of their great vegetarian selection (they have a whole vegetarian SECTION
FOOD	[ O  ]	a relieving site for hungry vegetarian eyes
FOOD	[ O  ]	) My carnivorous friend are big fans of Monty's as well, so it's not for vegetarians only
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like their overall ambiance and their waitstaff is good if not great
FOOD	[ O  ]	The deserts are a MUST
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their shakes are really something to drool over, and their pies and cakes are delicious as well
FOOD	[ breakfasts ]	Oh, and scrumptious breakfasts!Last time I was there we had a table for four people
FOOD	[ O  ]	We ordered: one Reuben, one Sheldon (Reuben's vegetarian cousin) as is, two vegan Sheldons
FOOD	[ O  ]	What can I say, my friends and I like kraut
FOOD	[ O  ]	But yeah
FOOD	[ cheese ]	The Sheldon can be made vegan, and even without cheese (gasp) it's really delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Someone else mentioned that it was dry, but I order this almost every time and am never disappointed
FOOD	[ fries ]	The fries are awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good (but expensive) Bloody Marys
FOOD	[ pie ]	They have vegan pie slices and can make VEGAN MILKSHAKES
FOOD	[ O  ]	:)I am a vegetarian and this is the only place i can get good comfort food!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Me and the bf started with the oreo shake
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We ordered one but they were nice enough to split it for us
FOOD	[ O  ]	and we didn't ask
FOOD	[ O  ]	bonus points there
FOOD	[ meatloaf, sandwich, mashed potatoes, cashew, gravy ]	I ordered the meatless meatloaf sandwich, which was served open face with mashed potatoes and cashew gravy
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was weird looking but so so so delicious
FOOD	[ cheese ]	 Made of carrots and cheese and other goodness the whole plate was fabulous!
FOOD	[ BLT ]	BF got the TNT BLT
FOOD	[ O  ]	he was not a fan but I loved that too
FOOD	[ blt, waffle, fries ]	just a basic veg blt, with the spicy waffle fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I do not like their ranch dressing though
FOOD	[ O  ]	it's like the generic brand
FOOD	[ dessert, carrot, cake, raspberry, cheesecake ]	For dessert we got some of the carrot cake and raspberry cheesecake to go
FOOD	[ dessert ]	I will from now on always get dessert, it was the best part!!!
FOOD	[ Cake ]	Next time I am trying the FAt Elvis Cake!!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	**update
FOOD	[ O  ]	***
FOOD	[ Cake ]	Tried the Fat Elvis Cake
FOOD	[ Banana bread, cake, peanut butter, chocolate ]	AMAZING!  Banana bread-cake layered with peanut butter frosting topped with chocolate frosting
FOOD	[ O  ]	Will definately get this again!Can't do animals, can't do dairy, yet am a food warrior
FOOD	[ O  ]	Indeed, Madison abounds with options for a gal like me, but Monty's marks my favorite eatery in the city
FOOD	[ O  ]	Intentionally old-school in its decor and prices, it's a throwback that appeals to anyone with a frontal cortex
FOOD	[ soup ]	My waitress brought me a gratis cup of the home-made veg soup as I was sitting at the end of the counter an she hadn't seen me for a few minutes (aaaaand the tip started to go up)
FOOD	[ meatloaf ]	 I had the meatless meatloaf thing also mentioned here, and good LORD the portion size was outta control
FOOD	[ Yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes, potato ]	The roll was the size of a Yorkshire pudding and the mashed potatoes were actually made of potato, fancy that
FOOD	[ loaf, cashew, gravy ]	The meatless loaf itself was solidly good (shredded root veg with a cheesy binder - wish I had known that prior to ordering, but should've asked) but a bit oily and the cashew gravy was goooood
FOOD	[ wine, beer ]	So many great-looking options for veg-heads like myself, hallelujah a-MEN, and they even have a small wine list and beer
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	I couldn't get through the entire pile of food, despite being a hormonal food warrior that day, yet I craved a sweet and Monty's has soy ice cream
FOOD	[ O  ]	WTF, OTHER DINERS? I nearly wept at this one
FOOD	[ mint, chip, grapefruit, bowl ]	I had the mint chip, 2 scoops, which again were more like two grapefruit spilling over the sides of the bowl
FOOD	[ O  ]	That, I could do
FOOD	[ O  ]	My total bill came to $8
FOOD	[ O  ]	EIGHT
FOOD	[ O  ]	I added a 50% tip and blew Monty's a kiss as I left; I shall RETURN! Waitress was a sweetie, the staff all seemed to be pretty happy, and the place was approaching fullness when I left
FOOD	[ O  ]	My fondness for Monty's justifies the caps
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a diner and should be treated as such- the service is hit-or-miss, the atmosphere isn't anything special, and everything on the menu is pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	A few tips for enjoying all this place has to offer: 
FOOD	[ malt ]	Share a malt or shake with someone- they are delicious and HUGE, so way too much to eat with the well-portioned meals, but half of one is perfect and satisfying
FOOD	[ O  ]	Find something that you like on the menu and stick with it- there are a number of exceptional things on the menu (i
FOOD	[ Meatloaf ]	the Meatless Meatloaf), but everything else is average
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd probably give this 3 stars, but the amount of vegetarian options is fantastic and deserves another star
FOOD	[ eggs, english muffin ]	I wouldn't eat here for breakfast unless you like poached eggs that are hard cooked or a soggy english muffin
FOOD	[ english muffin, eggs ]	Something so frighteningly easy to make (the Mediterranean: toasted english muffin, veggie medley, poached eggs) turned out terribly wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	Makes me wonder how the basics escaped them this morning
FOOD	[ O  ]	Except when it comes to the pies
FOOD	[ Pie, pie, pie, coffee, pie, dessert, pie ]	Pie pie pie! coffee, pie, dessert, pie, bakery, cakes, yummy, beautiful
FOOD	[ pie ]	pie! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Catch my drift?After seeing old friends at the last Latin Night at The Cardinal (http://www
FOOD	[ O  ]	yelp
FOOD	[ O  ]	com/biz/cardinal-bar-madison#hrid:KfYiEWXAc-SlP_qEiUO6Hw) we agreed to meet here for breakfast on Monday morning
FOOD	[ O  ]	Well, not all of us made it but good times were had while eating
FOOD	[ ass, French Toast ]	 This is the closest to a 'real' diner that Madison has that I've been to but they have some truly kick ass pieces of fat French Toast
FOOD	[ bacon, eggs, french toast, cream, Blue Plate, Omelette, home fries, orange juice ]	I had bacon & eggs, french toast w/ coffe & cream and my daughter had the Blue Plate Omelette w/ home fries and orange juice
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good place to come with a group of old friends or your kids (if they know how to act right in public
FOOD	[ O  ]	)Monty's offers many vegetarian options
FOOD	[ Reuben sandwich, meat ]	For example, they offer the Reuben sandwich for meat eaters and the Sheldon for vegetarians
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am consistently disappointed when I visit Monty's
FOOD	[ fries, glass ]	On the last visit, I my fries were cold and my glass was dirty and cracked
FOOD	[ cheeseburger, onions ]	A companion ordered a plain cheeseburger and it was loaded with onions
FOOD	[ carrot, cake, cake ]	The carrot cake was obviously old--the cake was dried and the frosting was crusty
FOOD	[ German chocolate cake ]	Another companion got the German chocolate cake which was also dry
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a cool place, but needs better food
FOOD	[ O  ]	My impression of Monty's is very conflicting
FOOD	[ O  ]	On one hand, I want to say Monty's is an awesome place with great food
FOOD	[ O  ]	On the other hand I want to say Monty's is overrated
FOOD	[ O  ]	Let me explain
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love Monty's because of the options
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are a vegetarian or vegan you aren't confined to the world of salads
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are many delicious and satisfying options
FOOD	[ diet ]	If you don't restrict your diet in any way, there are many great meaty and chalorically rich options for you too
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	Watching carbs? Get a sandwich in a wrap
FOOD	[ meat, chicken, dishes ]	Looking for a healthy lean meat option? Choose one of the several good chicken dishes
FOOD	[ meat, dishes ]	I personally steer towards the lean meat or veggie dishes and have never been disappointed
FOOD	[ diet ]	It's really hard to find a restaurant that caters to my needs as well as my boyfriend's nonrestrictive diet needs
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place does it well and at a pretty decent price
FOOD	[ O  ]	Though, I don't personally think Monty's is overrated, I feel that the point needs to be made
FOOD	[ O  ]	Whatever you order will be fresh and pretty tasty
FOOD	[ Meatloaf, meatloaf, ketchup ]	However, say you order The Meatloaf of the Gods, it may not be what you expect if you are the type of person that is looking for traditional 'the-way-mom-made-it' meatloaf slathered with ketchup
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are looking for an extensive breakfast menu consisting of traditional American breakfast combos (i
FOOD	[ eggs, hash browns, meat ]	- a dish that contains ALL of the following: pancakes, eggs, hash browns, 3 kinds of meat and toast), Denny's or Perkin's may be a better option for you
FOOD	[ dishes ]	They put their own spin on the more traditional dishes and have created an awesome list of in-house specialties
FOOD	[ meat, Meatloaf ]	Whether you eat meat or not you MUST try The Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's amazing
FOOD	[ beef, beef, walnut ]	Like your beef? Definitely try the Blueplate Burger! Don't like beef so much but still want a burger? Try the Blueplate Burger with a locally made walnut burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	No matter who you are, Monty's is worth a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's is a great diner-esque restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	I couldn't even imagine counting all the times I've been here in all my years in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hungover, bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready for bed, and otherwise
FOOD	[ O  ]	Want breakfast? Go to Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lunch? Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dinner? You guessed it, Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is consistently good
FOOD	[ cook ]	The cook will often come out to the tables and joke with the customers which is pretty refreshing
FOOD	[ coffee ]	If you're looking for weekend breakfast, there may be a line, but at least you can sip coffee while you wait
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Good coffee, at that!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's will always hold a special place in my heart
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh! And lots of vegetarian options, also
FOOD	[ O  ]	Maybe I got the wrong thing, but I'm thinking these Madison institutions thrive on folks who would rave about a can of Spaghettios if it was served as an original dish and was priced at $8
FOOD	[ O  ]	95
FOOD	[ O  ]	because that was my experience with a turkey club
FOOD	[ french roll ]	I can't tell you what it tasted like, because all I could taste was the french roll it came on
FOOD	[ bacon, tomato, lettuce ]	Why you ask? Because it had once slice (yes folks - ONE slice of turkey), two slices of bacon, some tomato, and lettuce
FOOD	[ bucks, sandwich ]	I really paid nearely 9 bucks for a sandwich with one slice of turkey? Are east siders so beholden to their institutions that they are afraid to be critical of poor value, and sub par food? Service was service
FOOD	[ O  ]	nothing memorable, but then again I'm not expecting expert service at a place that serves soda in a plastic cup
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sorry if I sound bitter, but I'm really starting to get irritated w/ all this Madison dining nonsense
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have yet to be really thrilled by what I eat
FOOD	[ hot dog, bun, bun ]	Oh, and who toasts a hot dog bun? Cooking school 101 will tell you the bun will fall apart
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is ALWAYS a wait, but what can you do
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is delicious
FOOD	[ Blue Plate ]	Once you get a table, enjoy!Monty's Blue Plate Diner is one of those funny contradictions-in-terms that is a restaurant which is both good but overrated
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Overall, though, it is far and away my favorite Food Fight place and a fairly reliable spot to get a good meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's food is better than hit-or-miss but not quite consistently good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Most of the things I've eaten there, especially the breakfast foods, have been delicious (and huge), but I've had a couple of very sub-par meals (one was so bad I literally could not eat more than a couple of bites)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The things that I ate and disliked are now off the menu, so that does say something for their ability to identify what's working and what isn't
FOOD	[ egg ]	 What I can say is that the egg-based breakfast-y menu items are almost universally good
FOOD	[ Blue Plate, cheddar, avocado, bacon ]	 The "scrambled something-or-other" never fails to disappoint, nor does the newer Blue Plate Omelet (the one with cheddar, avocado and bacon
FOOD	[ O  ]	good lord!)
FOOD	[ burrito, chorizo ]	 And the breakfast burrito is especially good, even without chorizo (which is how I usually order it)
FOOD	[ potatoes, biscuits ]	 As for the breakfast side items, the potatoes are just okay; the biscuits are great
FOOD	[ coffee, coffee ]	 Most importantly of all, the coffee is superb (even my mother thinks so and she drinks a hell of a lot more coffee than I do)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Unfortunately, I tend to shy away from the lunch and dinner items so I can't really speak to their quality
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The pies, though, are heaven
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And it's certainly worth noting that the menu pays special attention to including veg*n options
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere is pretty awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Outdoor seating is spacious and comfy
FOOD	[ glass ]	 Indoors, the blue-topped tables are fun for making patterns with the wet bottom of your water glass
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Get a booth if you can; the tables are a bit cramped
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waitstaff are generally friendly and attentive
FOOD	[ menus, choice ]	The upshot is that if you think you'll enjoy eating at a diner that's 70% greasy spoon and 30% hipster hot spot, and if you like breakfast foods and are a "good orderer" (you choose from menus wisely), Monty's is an excellent choice
FOOD	[ Corned beef ]	Corned beef hash, please marry me
FOOD	[ eggs, fruit, biscuit ]	You come with eggs, fruit, and a delicious biscuit
FOOD	[ O  ]	You are potatoey and oniony and wonderful
FOOD	[ Coconut cream, pie ]	Coconut cream pie, you make my booty more bootylicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Mmm
FOOD	[ omelette, cheese, biscuit, potatoes ]	Awesome breakfast!!! Had the "something or other scramble" and it was amazing, kinda like an omelette that is scrambled but with more cheese!  Breakfast also comes with a super fluffy, light biscuit and some sliced, browned potatoes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious, absolutely delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Plus the waiter took pity on us being so hungover and gave me some aspirin, so he automatically ranks high in my book
FOOD	[ O  ]	The cupcakes are a must have as well
FOOD	[ banana, cake, peanut butter, chocolate ]	I tried the Fat Elvis and was amazed; banana cake stuffed full of peanut butter and frosted with plenty of chocolate! Now i see why everyone loves the bakery here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like this place because they have so many vegetarian options
FOOD	[ BLT, tempeh ]	I loved the vege BLT with strips of tempeh yummy :) I love the atmosphere of the place as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	I do think their prices are kind of high, but the food hits the spot!Monty's goes back a very long time in Madison and is a great place to get a home-cooked style meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I used to go with my parents as a kid, and now as an adult I've started to rediscover how much I loved their food
FOOD	[ meatloaf, meatloaf, sandwiches, brunch ]	Nestled in the eclectic Atwood Ave neighborhood, Monty's presents a 50's style diner with yummy lunch specials like meatloaf (very good meatloaf), sandwiches, and a wicked good brunch
FOOD	[ chocolate ]	 They also have ridiculously delicious chocolate shakes, so don't be afraid to splurge while you're there
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of the other great things about Monty's is the atmosphere; the area around it is filled with little mom and pop shops, the Barrymore theater, and relics of an older time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Take a stroll around if it's a nice day and your bound to find something you like
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 If not, I'm sure you probably enjoyed the food as all the dishes I've ever had were great and the portions were generous
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are a few drawbacks though that held me back from giving a 5 star review
FOOD	[ O  ]	 First, there is usually a very long wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The place is popular, but I don't feel that the food and eastside location (I live far westside) always justifies the overall experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Secondly, the service is hit or miss
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've had some waitresses who were prompt and polite, making me feel right at home, and others who were sarcastically rude to the point where people in my party almost had to say something
FOOD	[ biscuits ]	 Furthermore, the kitchen doesn't always look clean, as trays of biscuits have been left sitting out and flies have been a buzzing
FOOD	[ blue plate ]	Setting all those things aside though (which I know may be hard for some), the blue plate is a Madison delight that should not be missed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is so good you'll be stuffed in a recliner when you get home pining for more
FOOD	[ biscuit, breakfasts ]	We went here over the summer and I still dream about the biscuit that comes with the breakfasts
FOOD	[ brunch ]	The wait for brunch was long, but the free papers and indoor/outdoor waiting area made it entirely bearable
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu, as others have mentioned, is very very vegetarian friendly
FOOD	[ pesto, mushroom, spinach, feta ]	We tried the pesto + mushroom omelet, which was original and delicious, as was the spinach + feta omelet
FOOD	[ milk shake ]	We also tried a recommended milk shake, which was worth the splurge
FOOD	[ O  ]	This will be the first place we stop next time we are in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our server was friendly and everything we ordered was delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife and I have been here twice and have loved it each time!  This is not only a nice place to go if you're craving something vegetarian
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	 They have great sandwiches and bowls that are enjoyable,  The pies are usually fantastic!  So many choices
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't think you can go wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	 For a place that looks like your classic greasy diner, it offers a more home-cooked feel with a veggie vibe
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Definitely worth checking out!I love Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere is kitschy and cool, and they have something for everyone (even the vegetarians and picky eaters)
FOOD	[ O  ]	The wait can be a little on the excessive side, so don't hold off until you're hungry
FOOD	[ dessert ]	I never manage to save room for dessert, but I hear the pies are excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	They always have better than average waitstaff
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have plenty of vegetarian options for classic diner food that they do very well
FOOD	[ meat, tofu ]	Many other places try to awkwardly replace meat with tofu and end up failing
FOOD	[ seitan, beans, walnut, tofu ]	Monty's mostly knows when to use seitan, beans, walnut burgers, tofu and has a nice variety
FOOD	[ O  ]	They're often busy, so don't go if you can't wait
FOOD	[ dishes ]	Some of the dishes are phenomenal and some are simply okay
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think it makes getting an average dish more disappointing when last time, you got something so wonderful, but c'est la vie
FOOD	[ O  ]	Remember what you like and see what others have enjoyed
FOOD	[ BLT ]	(TNT BLT is amazing, the Sheldon is meh
FOOD	[ dessert ]	Also, remember to eat your dessert first, the portions are generous and you don't want to miss out on such an important part of the meal
FOOD	[ brunch, breakfast food ]	Monty's is one of my fave brunch-or-lunch places, especially on lazy weekends when I want breakfast food at 2pm but do not want big-chain food
FOOD	[ biscuits, gravy, cake ]	 They have a wide array of something for everyone from vegan offerings to biscuits and gravy to slices of cake taller than your head, and it's all tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	It does get really crowded at peak times, and the service can be hit-or-miss to an extreme:  sometimes I've gotten a server who hangs around making hilarious jokes and sometimes I've been in parties that were actually forgotten about after we were seated and then have the orders wrong when we finally did get our food (although the bad service is definitely more rare than the good)
FOOD	[ O  ]	All-in-all the tasty food and the kitschy atmosphere make it worth the wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a great restaurant to go to in a charming neighborhood
FOOD	[ Mass ]	Gramma in town? Take her, she loves home cooking! Post Critical Mass carbo load? Wheel on in! Conservative couple on 
FOOD	[ date, fuel ]	the third date and need to fuel up before doing it for the first time? Jackpot! As a bonus: With it's proximity to the storied Barrymore Theater, it is not uncommon to dine amongst musical geniusii
FOOD	[ pie ]	Diner-esque feel and fare with lots of visual distractions (you may need them for the inevitable wait) You will more than likely hear screams of ecstasy after someone has the pie
FOOD	[ O  ]	Comfort food for the masses (Yes, you too my veggie sucking pals!) 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hmmmmmmm
FOOD	[ salt ]	Do you like the idea good-looking salt of the Earth houseboys? Well, whomever does the hiring at Monte's does too
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have not seen one unattractive employee yet
FOOD	[ O  ]	Besides being beautiful, they are efficient in their positions
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitstaff is friendly and quick, cooks have yet to fail my taste buds, and the bakers make some of the yummiest cakes in the state
FOOD	[ meatloaf, cashew, gravy, mashed potatoes, mimosa, cake ]	For maximum food coma-ry, I'd recommend the (fake)meatloaf w/cashew gravy, mashed potatoes, a mimosa chased with a piece of Fat Elvis cake
FOOD	[ til ]	Remember you are in Wisconsin and you don't have to have any regard for caloric intakes any longer, and eat til you either pass out or essplode,no judgment
FOOD	[ meatloaf, cashew, gravy ]	In fact the fake meatloaf/cashew gravy is so fabulous, that I have 
FOOD	[ mole ]	sent a mole into the kitchens of Monte's to snag the recipe
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes, I am that powerful/desperate
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love this place
FOOD	[ brunch ]	Gets crowded around the normal brunch time, so go early or go late
FOOD	[ O  ]	Otherwise, it's probably going to be at least a 30 minute wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	Huge portions
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love their omelets
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lots of vegetarian options (if that's your thing - not mine)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Haven't tried their desserts, but they always look tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service: Good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've always had very nice servers
FOOD	[ O  ]	And I'm willing to cut them slack since they're always really busy
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Plus they're pretty quick with the coffee refills
FOOD	[ O  ]	Environment: Old school diner feel - with booths and stools! Doesn't feel cramped even when it gets crowded
FOOD	[ O  ]	Side notes: I LOVE diners
FOOD	[ biscuit, fatty ]	Also, if you eat the biscuit, you're a fatty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lunch on a Saturday afternoon, with 2 small kids? No problem
FOOD	[ chalk, min ]	Monty's provided chalk outside for use while you waited (15 min was quoted, actual wait time was
FOOD	[ O  ]	well
FOOD	[ O  ]	who pays attention to the clock when you're busy chalking?)
FOOD	[ menus, cups, bat ]	Kids menus and cups were also provided, and the waiter didn't bat an eye at the mess the kids made
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu is varied - breakfast, entrees, sammiches - but steps outside of the 'normal' fare to throw a few curveballs
FOOD	[ spinach, feta, mass ]	My spinach/feta burger tasted fresh and not mass-produced
FOOD	[ O  ]	Only downside is that the place is loud - but then, that turns into a positive when you're with a hungry 11month old
FOOD	[ O  ]	:)Hash was a smash for me
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also Tim the owner sang us a Dylan song
FOOD	[ biscuits, potatoes ]	Great biscuits, also liked the potatoes
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is a must try if you are in Mad-town
FOOD	[ dishes, zucchini ]	Great local diner, that features lost of creative dishes-like zucchini pancakes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Awesome bakery and great, home cooking
FOOD	[ O  ]	 While i'm prone to go with breakfast items, the lunch offerings have also always been good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I don't think you can really go wrong here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Decor screams old-time diner, maybe even at the expense of feeling a little bit forced
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All the same, this place should be a regular stop for anybody in madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had a wonderful breakfast here but the most wonderful thing was that the manager sang for us
FOOD	[ O  ]	We loved it--- the place brought back all the warm fuzzy feelings that we get for Madison and Wisconsin and we were here with our son and girlfriend and had a great time
FOOD	[ ice cream, beverage ]	Fantastic vegetarian and nonvegetarian food alike, great ice cream, adult beverage selection is to die for
FOOD	[ Bloody mary ]	Bloody mary's on a sunday morning? Yes please
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great service and atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is good - comfort food for the soul
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was disappointed with my experience, but I'm willing to give it another shot
FOOD	[ O  ]	The main problem was our waiter
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had very slow service
FOOD	[ menus ]	We were seated outside and had to go in to ask for our menus
FOOD	[ coffee ]	I ordered coffee and half-and-half, but I didn't get a spoon or something to stir it with, which I thought was odd
FOOD	[ O  ]	I just kind of swished it around
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was weird
FOOD	[ artichoke, tomato, asiago ]	Our waiter failed to tell us the scrambler special and when we asked he told us it was artichoke, tomato and asiago
FOOD	[ artichokes ]	However, when it arrived the artichokes were not there
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was very disappointing
FOOD	[ potatoes ]	The breakfast potatoes were also a real let down
FOOD	[ potatoes ]	I love potatoes and they failed
FOOD	[ biscuit ]	However, the biscuit was delicious
FOOD	[ pie ]	We also ordered pie
FOOD	[ pie ]	Two of our party ordered the Fat Elvis - which does not come in a pie-form - so they were upset
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their other waiter must have made that mistake
FOOD	[ key lime pie ]	I went for the key lime pie which was delicious
FOOD	[ drumstick, peanut butter ]	The Fat Elvis was replaced with a drumstick (?) which I guess was good, but I don't like peanut butter
FOOD	[ O  ]	Another thing is if you sit outside, they will give you plastic silverware
FOOD	[ O  ]	I didn't mind, but others in my party did
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, they only take Visa and Mastercard
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, the food was good, but the service was not
FOOD	[ O  ]	Andrew K attempted to show off his humor ("Elvis has left the building"), but we found it rather obnoxious because we were sick of waiting
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll give him some slack because there were a lot of people seated outside, but I feel he could have paid a bit more attention
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really cool & interesting veggie options, cool atmosphere, nice area, what more could you ask for? They even have a giant selection of pies! Voted best veggie restaurant in madison, but half of the menu or more isnt veggie, so everyone will be happy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Check it out
FOOD	[ french toast ]	Donut french toast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Enough said
FOOD	[ bean, salad, fries ]	 :)Won best greasy spoon in Madison, yet has vegan options and bean salad as an alternative to fries! Yes, a great retro diner, but with modern options
FOOD	[ dessert ]	And a dessert case
FOOD	[ O  ]	Awesome!Yum
FOOD	[ O  ]	Have been here a few times, and have never left disappointed
FOOD	[ choice ]	It's an easy choice on my "vegan" days when I still want something that feels sort of bad for you and diner-y (versus Green Owl, which is fantastic but sometimes feels TOO healthy)
FOOD	[ pie, peanut butter ]	All the sandwhiches I've tried have been great, and the pie is SOOO good - especially any one with peanut butter in it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service can be a little slow and invisible, at times, but the food makes it totally worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Looking forward to hitting it up again in the fall
FOOD	[ O  ]	Stopped here on the way home from the Dells because you bastards said it was good and guess what!? I AGREE!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Aside from the fact that it was freezing cold in there, I realllllllllly enjoyed the hell our of this place
FOOD	[ dishes ]	First of all, the menu is composed of a bunch of awesome dishes; I wanted to order everything on the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was as if they had scanned the portion of my brain that deals with Amanda eating habits and wrote a menu based on the data collected from the scan
FOOD	[ Fettucini, Blue Plate ]	Fettucini Alfredo and a turkey dinner!? Blue Plate, you shouldn't have! I'll order both!
FOOD	[ sandwich, avocado ]	Actually, I got a turkey sandwich with avocado on it
FOOD	[ avocado ]	I realllllly like avocado
FOOD	[ sandwiches, Blue Plate ]	I really like turkey sandwiches, too, and let me tell you Blue Plate did not disappoint
FOOD	[ salad, fries, sandwich ]	Everything was mad good from the salad to the fries to the sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cheap prices, good portions
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're in the area I definitely suggest you hit this place up
FOOD	[ leftovers ]	Mail me the leftovers!I've been to Monty's at least once for every meal
FOOD	[ omelettes, spinach, feta ]	The omelettes are to die for, huge in quantity unique in ingredients- highly recommend the spinach and feta
FOOD	[ O  ]	The salads are the same thing, definitely large and delicious
FOOD	[ loaf, cashew, gravy, cashew ]	Last night I went for dinner and got the meatless loaf, and now I want the recipe for the cashew gravy (if my memory serves me correctly, it was cashew
FOOD	[ O  ]	) to put on EVERYTHING
FOOD	[ O  ]	Amazing shakes and malts complete the perfect comfort/diner food experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's is obviously a popular and beloved place, judging by the number of reviews, and rightly so
FOOD	[ beat ]	Hard to beat the combination of an old-school setting and really good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only knock against it is the crowds, especially for weekend breakfast
FOOD	[ French toast ]	But do make an effort to have breakfast there sometime - the donut French toast is fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	They also have great pies and desserts, and they do all the diner standards really well
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh my why didn't I review this place, like, a year ago?  
FOOD	[ O  ]	What's not to like about Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The only bad thing (which is really a great thing) is all menu choices, especially if you're a vegetarian
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's sort of scaled-up-diner-food-meets-comfort-food, then add a fair share healthy options
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And great prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And great service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Although it's not on Willy St
FOOD	[ O  ]	it still has the same friendly neighborhood atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	So I've been to Monty's twice, both times late morning, and was seated and served quickly
FOOD	[ spinach, feta, salmon ]	 The first visit a friend and I split the spinach and feta omelet which was great and large enough for both of us, and a third friend had the salmon hash
FOOD	[ chef ]	 After our meal Monty himself (well, not sure if it was the Real Monty, so lets say the chef) came out to ask us how our meal was
FOOD	[ chicken fried steak ]	 The second visit I went with a lunch item and ordered chicken fried steak, also great and the portions were easily enough for two people
FOOD	[ cake, banana, cake, peanut butter, fudge, icing, chocolate, icing ]	 Once again Monty came out and greeted his diners!  Ordered a piece of Fat Elvis cake to go, which is banana cake layered with peanut butter fudge icing and topped with chocolate icing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum!Yum! Monty's was absolutely adorable
FOOD	[ O  ]	After eating dinner there I can say with certainty this will become one of my new regulars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Right when I walked in I knew it would be a place I would enjoy
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere was that of an older, trendy diner and had a quick moving, upbeat, friendly staff making the atmosphere even more enjoyable
FOOD	[ artichoke, sandwich, chicken, pie ]	My friend got the artichoke sandwich, delicious, and I got the chicken in a pie, right from grandma's kitchen
FOOD	[ cupcake ]	Afterwards we ordered a red velvet cupcake which was to die for, and all for under $15
FOOD	[ conversation ]	We shared great conversation and didn't feel at all rushed, our waitress was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	She made recommendations and shared jokes with us, not seeming to put up a front at all
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will be going back sooner rather than later
FOOD	[ O  ]	In my opinion, almost all restaurants in the Madison area are bland
FOOD	[ O  ]	People may hate me for thinking it, but I don't care
FOOD	[ spice, flavor ]	There's no spice, little flavor, and it's gotten to the point where I just don't really go out, because I'm sick of wasting my money on mediocre food
FOOD	[ O  ]	It got to the point where I thought my tastebuds were dying
FOOD	[ Blue Plate ]	Enter Monty's Blue Plate
FOOD	[ loaf, sammich, meatloaf ]	I had the meatless loaf sammich, and it was awesome, though it tasted nothing like meatloaf
FOOD	[ waffle, fries ]	The waffle fries? delicious
FOOD	[ dip ]	The dipping sauce? Don't even think of stealing a dip
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will bite you
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was so much I wanted
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will be back, perhaps tomorrow
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will find excuses to wander to the east side, then say "While I'm here, I might as well hit Monty's"
FOOD	[ O  ]	All-in-all, Monty's is making my life better
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thank you Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Okay, I straight up ordered the "heathen vegans shoplifter's delight" because of the name
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not proud of my devil may care attitude when it comes to ordering food, but reckless abandon at Monty's has proven fruitful
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delightful meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Everything about it matched the hippy dippy quarky way of MadCity life
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service was a shade slow and it wasn't crowded by any means, but I had good company
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Who cares
FOOD	[ O  ]	Friendly staff and nice selection of vegetarian options
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food is just okay, not great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Makes me wonder why everyone likes Food Fight so much
FOOD	[ O  ]	Eh
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is "fine"
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not terribly impressed with it
FOOD	[ O  ]	I could probably get better breakfast somewhere else
FOOD	[ O  ]	Plus its ALWAYS so so so busy in there
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like that they have a ton of vegetarian options
FOOD	[ O  ]	Which is rare for breakfast places
FOOD	[ O  ]	But meh
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its not amazing food
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of madison's best restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	Casual, come as you are atmosphere
FOOD	[ meatloaf ]	 Best meatloaf and other comfort foods on the planet
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pros:
FOOD	[ Meatloaf, peanut, gravy ]	Vegetarian Meatloaf of the Gods (with a yummy peanut gravy)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lots of cakes/pies
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cons:
FOOD	[ O  ]	Slow and often rude service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Awful bloody maries (suuper salty) 
FOOD	[ eggs ]	Overcooked poached eggs
FOOD	[ O  ]	Is it just me or is it always cold in there?Great place, I visited there this weekend and the service was blazing fast
FOOD	[ goat cheese, chicken, sandwich ]	I had the goat cheese chicken sandwich and it was excellent!If your vegetarian or not you will LOVE this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I think they put crack in their food its so good! I like everything here, but I take it to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	I hate being the creep lone diner - no Table for One 
FOOD	[ O  ]	There is on weird waiter I must admit but the food is so good 
FOOD	[ tofu ]	I like their hash and their tofu scramble 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I worship Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yummy food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service is usually great (but there are the occasional slip-ups)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Small dining room; booth seats and bar seating (try to grab a bar stool so you don't have to wait in line)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Wait can range from 15-30 minutes, I've never waited longer but probably would
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Breakfast is my favorite, although lunch is great too
FOOD	[ eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, biscuit ]	 I usually get the regular, eggs, potatoes, bacon/sausage and biscuit
FOOD	[ biscuit, biscuits ]	 I switch my biscuit out for toast (I just don't like biscuits, sorry!)
FOOD	[ tofu ]	 My mom, the vegan, usually orders her regular tofu scrambler
FOOD	[ potatoes ]	not bad!  But the potatoes are why I'm there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They give you plenty and it usually looks like I haven't even touched my meal after I'm done
FOOD	[ Meatloaf, sandwich ]	Try the Meatloaf sandwich for lunch
FOOD	[ waffle, fries ]	Yum!  There waffle fries are also delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have a display of pies in the front, though I've never tried them
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The delicious breakfast, nice staff, and cozy environment sold me
FOOD	[ meatloaf ]	Service was great and I like the atmosphere but I wouldn't say it's anything special (except for the the shakes and meatloaf - fit for the gods for sure!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Awesome dougnuts!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great place to take the grandparents--there is something that everyone will like
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Great coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice new 'local meats' section of the menu
FOOD	[ eggs, mornay ]	I have returned again and again for Monty's eggs mornay
FOOD	[ eggs benedict ]	When I first ordered it I thought I was getting a typical eggs benedict for breakfast but then something so much better came out
FOOD	[ Eggs, mornay, eggs benedict, mornay sauce ]	Eggs mornay is eggs benedict made with a mornay sauce instead of hollondaise sauce
FOOD	[ mornay sauce ]	The mornay sauce is creamier and peppery! It is so good
FOOD	[ mornay sauce, dip, potatoes ]	I once met a man who ordered a different breakfast but asked for a side of the mornay sauce to dip his potatoes in
FOOD	[ O  ]	that's my kind of breakfast!
FOOD	[ meatloaf, eggs, mornay, Blue Plate, meat ]	I've had their burgers and meatloaf as well, both are equally good but I keep coming back for the eggs mornay! I've also had their red velvet cupcakes which are pretty great too!When I was in Madison as a student I loved to go to the Blue Plate with friends because they always had options for the meat eaters and the vegetarians
FOOD	[ O  ]	As a former vegetarian, I think I first came here when I was a vegetarian
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was a long time ago
FOOD	[ dishes, meat loaf ]	The diner theme is part of the aesthetic here, and my favorite dishes are the meat loaf, and the breakfast scrambles
FOOD	[ breakfasts, brunch, rush ]	My friend and I got two big breakfasts and the service was good on what looked like a crazy-busy Sunday brunch-rush
FOOD	[ coffee, cups ]	The coffee dude was keeping our cups full and warm as our server was moving past us bringing out amazing plates of super fresh food, yet always checking with us to see how we were doing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Busy, high quality standards, and lots of great cakes and pies if you have any room
FOOD	[ pie, cake ]	I used to get the pie/cake to go, but not this time
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is just wonderful to see a place that was good over 10 years ago, still keeping its standards high and keeping people like me wishing they still lived in Madison! Great place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great people
FOOD	[ meal times ]	Really love it here, I would come here a lot more often if it were easier to get a table during meal times
FOOD	[ O  ]	The space is totally retro, very comfortable and has the chill feel of Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	There isn't really seating for groups larger than about six people, and even then it can be a squeeze
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've always considered their meals to be very consistent, which is key
FOOD	[ waffle, fries ]	My favorite thing is their GBLT and waffle fries
FOOD	[ sandwich, chipotle ]	The sandwich has some awesome chipotle sauce that gives it a special kick and the guac is always fresh tasting
FOOD	[ O  ]	Another highlight: alcoholic milkshakes, hell yeah! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like the range of the menu, there are many vegetarian and vegan options, and breakfast is served allllll day!
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff is always very friendly, service can be a little slow, but it generally isn't an issue because the place is pretty small
FOOD	[ O  ]	Excellent food
FOOD	[ biscuits, fruit, pie ]	 The biscuits are amazing, the fruit fresh and ripe, and I had the best piece of French silk pie I've ever had at this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've only ordered breakfast, but they do have an expansive menu that includes a nice selection of foods (including vegan)
FOOD	[ tea ]	The atmosphere is probably what stops me from going there more---it's just not my cup of tea
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The lighting is harsh and the seats can be kinda uncomfortable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Last time I went, I was freezing!
FOOD	[ O  ]	But don't let that stop you
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There's an amazing bakery display case in the front that is worth a stop alone
FOOD	[ Blue Plate ]	Monty's Blue Plate has consistently satisfied me year in and year out
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are a corner stone as far as diners go in Madison
FOOD	[ meat loaf ]	If you are looking for something hearty and kind of old fashioned, I suggest the meat loaf of the gods, perfectly done and very filling
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are a veg head or perhaps vegan, the heathen vegan's shoplifter delight is a must
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's I love you!!Monty's is a place you can go where the veg selections don't feel like an afterthought
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Order "The Sheldon"
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Trust me
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Also, amazing waitstaff and very good coffeeMonty's, Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love you Monty's
FOOD	[ chicken, salad ]	I love your grilled chicken salad
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	I love all your sandwiches
FOOD	[ coffee ]	I love the coffee and fountain drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	I get frustrated when the wait is long
FOOD	[ O  ]	and I'm sorry
FOOD	[ pie, crusts ]	the pies are beautiful and the fillings are delicious, but the pie crusts are NOT flaky
FOOD	[ pie ]	You can't have a pie without a flaky crust
FOOD	[ O  ]	It aint fitting! I wish you would open up a Monty's in Fitchburg! I love you Monty's!After posting my 2-star review, I received a message from a manager at Monty's, asking if he could send me some vouchers and if I would be willing to give them another try
FOOD	[ O  ]	I happily did that, and got the vouchers soon after! I have since been back to Monty's twice, once for breakfast and another time for dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service has been great both times; prompt and friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is pretty good, and is definitely a good value
FOOD	[ eggs, eggs ]	The prices might not be super cheap, but you get a lot of food! I've gotten poached eggs twice since I wrote my more negative review of Monty's, and both times the eggs have been cooked perfectly
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place has classic American diner written all over it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have yet to have even a subpar experience at this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	"So, tell me abou the food" you ask
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've been to Monty's for breakfast, and lunch and have had a consistently great meal every time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The breakfast menu offers up your standards
FOOD	[ eggs, bacon, coffee ]	 Heaping portions of eggs and bacon accompany a decent cup of coffee early in the morning
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	Their sandwiches are delicious and massive
FOOD	[ beef ]	 The burgers offer a unique collection of flavorings and are made with beef sourced from Black Earth Farms
FOOD	[ O  ]	a big plus from any foodie in the city
FOOD	[ waffle, fries ]	 Definitely break the bank and opt in for the waffle fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	and by break the bank I mean scrounge your pockets for the extra quarter the cost
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They are YUMMMMMY
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only knock I have on this place is the overall vibe
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The staff always goes above and beyond what I would expect, but the whole 50s diner scene never really held a special place in my heart
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Even with saying that, I'll definitely be back many, many times
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I could give this place 10 stars I would
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been coming here since opened and it is consistently the best
FOOD	[ fries, beer ]	Breakfast all day, more than just burgers and fries, deserts, beer selection
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't rave enough
FOOD	[ meatloaf, Coffee, blend ]	The meatloaf of the Gods is to die for and their Just Coffee roast (their own blend) is so amazingly good I have my mom buy it and send it up to me in Minneapolis
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's that good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Some of the people that work there have been there since I was a kid
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its a neighborhood place where you're bound to run into people you know and I make a point to go there at least twice while I'm home to visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yay Monty's!I like Monty's food--breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all very good--but I just can't help thinking that it's overpriced when I go there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It seems like it should be diner-priced 
FOOD	[ cheese ]	but almost $9 for a grilled cheese seems a bit steep to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Their desserts are to die for, though
FOOD	[ brunch ]	What a great place for brunch, not to mention filling!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've only been there once, but had to try it because I kept getting so many recommendations
FOOD	[ chicken, salad, sandwich ]	I had the chicken salad sandwich, not to saucy or creamy, and fresh
FOOD	[ chicken, salad, ciabatta ]	It had chopped chicken and salad on a ciabatta roll
FOOD	[ flavor ]	it had a great flavor
FOOD	[ fries, potatoes ]	I also switched out the fries for the house potatoes, which were also very good!
FOOD	[ Huevos Rancheros ]	My boyfriend decided to go with breakfast and had the Huevos Rancheros, he loved it and said he would definitely get it again
FOOD	[ O  ]	He's a picky eater so if he says something like that I trust that the food is good
FOOD	[ milk shakes, coffee ]	I also ordered one of their specialty milk shakes with coffee in it
FOOD	[ O  ]	What an amazing drink!!! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would definitely go back over and over again! And I'll wait with no problem because that usually means that the food is worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	On the return drive from the north, we wanted a fun, local diner with great food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yelp recommended the BPD as all of the above
FOOD	[ O  ]	When you walk in you are immediately presented with a series of sinister pies
FOOD	[ O  ]	All shapes, sizes and flavors
FOOD	[ O  ]	Man I gotta save room for that
FOOD	[ O  ]	We went to our booth and were immediately surrounded by families and folks just having desserts: exactly what we were looking for
FOOD	[ chicken, pie ]	For dinner, we had a very delicious chicken pie (how comforting, yet nuked perhaps?) and a vegan burger that was amazing! I have honestly never had such a delicious vegan burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	After reviewing the menu I quickly realized there were many vegan options
FOOD	[ O  ]	Excellent!
FOOD	[ O  ]	In all, our simple dinner came to $22 for both
FOOD	[ dessert ]	We skipped the dessert simply because we ran out of room in our tums
FOOD	[ O  ]	My girlfriend and I stopped here for dinner last night and we were both impressed with the quality and the price of the diner food
FOOD	[ beef, coffee, blend ]	The beef is local, from Black Earth, and the coffee is their own blend
FOOD	[ O  ]	The cupcakes were awesome!! Our waitress was really friendly and prompt also
FOOD	[ capsule ]	The service is excellent, the atmosphere a time capsule of a 50s diner & the food is some of the best diner fair I've ever had
FOOD	[ Meatloaf, Meatloaf ]	The Meatloaf is called the "Meatloaf of the Gods," and it truly is
FOOD	[ Meatloaf, culinary ]	I don't even like Meatloaf and I literally savored each bite of this culinary masterpiece
FOOD	[ meat, savory, vegetables, gravy ]	It is extremely filling because it is made with nutrient rich local meat, savory vegetables & topped with the best gravy I've ever tasted
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum!  For $10, how can't it be "As good as it gets?"
FOOD	[ pie ]	If you like pie, also make sure to get a slice
FOOD	[ Blue Plate ]	It is delicious!It was our first time visiting Monty's Blue Plate Diner and we will be going back our next time in Madison!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fun atmosphere, great food, nice variety on the menu and not overwhelming, excellent service, AWESOME desserts, great prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	we only wish there was another one close to where we live :)Yum & cool
FOOD	[ Zucchini ]	Zucchini pancakes! Feeling like you want retro? Monty's is the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Madison has the best food, this place is should on your list to try
FOOD	[ O  ]	Gross, disgusting, rip-off
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place makes me seriously doubt the Madisonian palate
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	I had a cheeseburger from here a few nights ago
FOOD	[ O  ]	I asked for medium - which to Monty's means completely raw in random spots
FOOD	[ pepper ]	Aside from the random rawness, the burger tasted like it was over seasoned with pepper
FOOD	[ meat, bun, meat ]	The meat was of absolute shit quality, the bottom bun was soggy (probably from undercooked meat juices), and I did get it to go
FOOD	[ ketchup, mustard ]	Thanks for the ketchup and mustard packets - now that's classy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have no reason to set foot in this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Every experience I've had up to point makes me wonder why I bothered to return one more time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Maybe there's something wrong with my palate, but to be honest, I'm pretty certain that there's not
FOOD	[ O  ]	East side institution? What a joke!I haven't been to Monty's in at least 15 years, so it was really nice to visit Madison and return to find it just as great as I remember
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great atmosphere and excellent service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Really excellent service
FOOD	[ Salmon, Salad ]	I had the Blackened Salmon Salad, which was great - I love that they have some healthy options
FOOD	[ eggs, bacon, all good ]	 My kids opted for pancakes, eggs and bacon - all good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My husband, who usually comments on how expensive a meal outside McDonald's is, actually made a "hey reasonable price" sort of comment
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That's sayin' something for the value!We stop here regularly and are generally pleased with the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Huge servings generally mean a two for one deal -- you get dinner and lunch the next day
FOOD	[ meat, fried chicken, meatloaf ]	 Vegetarian/vegan options as well as old fashioned meat choices like fried chicken and meatloaf
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All are quite tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only real disappointment is the desserts
FOOD	[ sugar ]	 They LOOK great in the prominent display case, but they just don't have much going for them except fat and sugar
FOOD	[ fruit, fruit, chocolate, chocolate ]	 It would be good for the fruit pies to taste a little like fruit and the chocolate desserts to have the richness and depth of chocolate
FOOD	[ sugar ]	 Just lots of fat and sugar so that generally, all the desserts taste about the same
FOOD	[ flavor, sugar ]	 The crumble-top pies are problematic both in terms of flavor and texture (and the fat/sugar problem)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That explains my 3-star review
FOOD	[ custard ]	Long story short, come for dinner and stop for frozen custard on the way home
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been coming here since I was in middle school and it was the cool place to hang out on half-days
FOOD	[ waffle, fries ]	6 orders of waffle fries, anyone?
FOOD	[ O  ]	We went last night for an early dinner and squeezed 7 people into a booth
FOOD	[ blueberry ]	I got blueberry pancakes (LOVE breakfast all day) and they were okay
FOOD	[ french toast, apple butter ]	 My friend's french toast came with apple butter though, and slathered on top of the pancakes = much better pancakes
FOOD	[ meatloaf, sandwich, fruit, sundaes ]	 Around the table there were also a few types of burgers, a meatloaf sandwich, a fruit plate, and a whole lot of milkshakes and sundaes
FOOD	[ sundaes ]	Big let down: they were out  of over half of the mix-ins for the milkshakes/sundaes
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can't have a dirt cup without gummy worms!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, I've always liked it here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service can be hit or miss
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Milkshakes are hurt-your-teeth sweet
FOOD	[ meatloaf ]	The meatloaf in every form is superb
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	There are three options, meatless, sandwich, and entree, and they are all 'of the gods
FOOD	[ O  ]	' Absolute favorite place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's is one of the many mind-boggling Food Fight restaurants that is a Madison favorite despite serving mediocre food
FOOD	[ BLT, tempeh, tomato ]	I've eaten one good dish here: the TNT BLT (tempeh and tomato)
FOOD	[ chocolate ]	And the chocolate shake is good if you need to consume an extraordinary number of calories on any given day
FOOD	[ O  ]	The last time I went, I did so because a friend told me the restaurant is attempting to make a switch to more sustainability-conscious, organic food
FOOD	[ chili ]	I ordered chili that was pretty much inedible
FOOD	[ soup ]	On another night, my boyfriend ordered a soup that was, again, inedible
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can imagine that people like to come here because the restaurant resembles an old-school diner and has booths, which are fun for kids to sit in
FOOD	[ O  ]	But the food quality is generally average to poor
FOOD	[ brunch, eggs ]	The brunch I've had is tasteless and limited, and you are not getting fresh eggs unless you order them over easy
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only reason I give Monty's two stars is because its pies are great
FOOD	[ BLT ]	And once in a while, I can stomach a TNT BLT because someone I'm with persuades me to give Monty's one 
FOOD	[ O  ]	more 
FOOD	[ O  ]	try
FOOD	[ O  ]	I recently visited Madison and went to Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Monty's is honestly such a great diner
FOOD	[ chicken, pot pie ]	 I especially love their chicken pot pie
FOOD	[ O  ]	very filling and so, so good
FOOD	[ soup ]	 The turkey soup is really yummy as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And the pies
FOOD	[ O  ]	absolutely amazing!!  
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really like the feel of the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's a great a place to go to and meet up with friends for sure
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great service as well!  (Leslie is an awesome server:-)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, a great diner all around
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Highly suggest (especially the desserts!)There's nothing I can add to the reviews here other than to say this is truly a five star diner
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 star exterior, 5 star interior, 5 star clean bathrooms
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 star cheery cool and efficient people who work there
FOOD	[ artichoke, salad, bean, salad ]	5 star artichoke salad with a 5 star "side" bean salad that you could take home and have for lunch the next day: it's BIG!
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 star shakes and burgers and other old school diner food in addition to all the 5 star new wave veggie & organic options
FOOD	[ O  ]	Next time I'm in Madison I'd like to try it for breakfast
FOOD	[ pie, cheesecake, dessert ]	good diner food with lot's of tasty vegetarian options and with pie or cheesecake for dessert
FOOD	[ meat ]	This place has it all: a huge menu that's perfectly executed, loads of vegetarian/vegan options (yet plenty to keep the meat-eaters happy), local and organic options, and quick service
FOOD	[ O  ]	and all the while they keep the prices appropriately cheap for a diner
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've found everything there to be tasty, and the place is always clean
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	Their Heathen Vegan Shoplifter's Delight sandwich is possibly the best thing I've ever tasted
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only downside is that I'm always too full to try one of their great looking desserts!Yucky greasy food
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a cute place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service was excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was hard to choose from all the great-sounding items on the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	 For the first ten minutes of my visit, I was really happy with it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Then the food came
FOOD	[ goat cheese, noodles, cheese, tomato ]	Ohmigod, it was GROSS!  I ordered fettuchini with goat cheese, expecting a pile of noodles, some alfredo-ish sauce and cheese over the top, and maybe if I was lucky a few pine nuts or tomato bits or herbs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nuh-uh
FOOD	[ noodles, cheese, butter ]	It was like somebody took a huge glob of cafeteria noodles, rolled them around in a cup of grated cheese, put a stick of butter on top and microwaved the whole mess on high for a minute
FOOD	[ garlic bread, sandwich, garlic, butter ]	 The garlic bread was the kind of roll you'd use to make a sub sandwich dipped in some garlic butter
FOOD	[ leftovers ]	 My dog has deposited more appealing piles on the back lawn after gorging on leftovers
FOOD	[ choice ]	  Checking out the other tables, I doubt anything else would have been a better choice
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is what they call comfort food--what Mom would give you to cheer you up after your Little League team lost or something
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I suppose people like this stuff because of the emotional connotations, I don't know
FOOD	[ cook ]	 My actual mom knew how to cook
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She would have called this stuff "white food
FOOD	[ salad ]	"  The servings are huge, except for the side salad which could have fit in a teacup
FOOD	[ O  ]	Many people love this diner
FOOD	[ cheese ]	 If you're a mac-and-cheese type person, you may very well love it too
FOOD	[ Sweet potato, tofu ]	Sweet potato hash is fantastic!  The tofu scramble has a bit of a spicy kick and is a great option for vegans
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 In fact, their veg dishes are just plain good
FOOD	[ cheesecake ]	Service is very friendly and their cheesecake is very creamy and delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Super Vegan/Vegetarian friendly, and can will accommodate any and all tastes!
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu is pretty much impossible to choose from, since there are so many delicious items on it
FOOD	[ O  ]	I usually break down and get one of their awesome burgers
FOOD	[ Walnut ]	I only travel to Madison once every couple years to visit family, and I frequently think back to how yummy their Walnut veggie patties are
FOOD	[ chocolate, malt, waffle, fries ]	My Grammy always orders a chocolate malt and the waffle fries (which are top-notch)
FOOD	[ O  ]	She's 93, and she knows what's up
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is the place to be
FOOD	[ brunch ]	One of my favorite brunch spots in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good vegan and vegetarian options as well
FOOD	[ meat, dishes, tofu ]	 I'm a meat-eater and have had one or two of their all veggie dishes and been very impressed (I like the tofu scrambler)  Another favorite is whatever the scrambler of the day is
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good reuben for lunch too
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really loved this restaurant! Homestyle, diner food with a twist - including lots of options for vegetarians
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was outstanding, as people beyond my primary server helped ensure that my drink was full and needs addressed
FOOD	[ cheese ]	I had the Ultimate Mac, and it sure was ultimate! The best mac n' cheese I've ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	The portion size was definitely enough for two to share
FOOD	[ bowl, garlic bread ]	I tried not to think about the calories that I was consuming when I downed the entire bowl plus the two pieces of garlic bread that came with it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything here was okay
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was okay, the service was pretty good, and um
FOOD	[ O  ]	the atmosphere was okay?
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's nothing particularly compelling here for me to write about
FOOD	[ O  ]	My food was enjoyable, but nothing to write home about
FOOD	[ O  ]	There seemed to be a lot of vegetarian options, but since I'm not vegetarian in the least, that didn't make much difference to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	Again, the service was pretty good and our server was friendly, but overall nothing too exciting
FOOD	[ dessert ]	A late night dessert run with my pregnant bestie led to a Monty's revelation:
FOOD	[ Cow, ice cream, brownie ]	They now serve (organic, classy) Sassy Cow ice cream, have even nicer and more delectable cheesecakes and their brownie sundae puts the Ella's Sparkled Kazoo to shame
FOOD	[ brownie ]	Post-brownie sundae, bestie's baby to-be kicked
FOOD	[ fudge ]	I think it was the hot fudge
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its a great place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Both me and my wife thought it had a great summer feel in the 50s
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What's nice about it is that it has a Madison vegetarian twist
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If we would've been hungrier the pies looked amazing but our bellies had reached their capacity
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall quality, its traditional american diner feel w/ a twist of Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great spot for a sit down lunch on a road trip
FOOD	[ Blue Plate, bowl, chili, corn bread, chocolate, pie, a la mode ]	I LOVE this place-I went to L'Etoile on Friday night and Monty's Blue Plate on Saturday afternoon-guess where I had the better meal?!?  Monty's won by a landslide-a giant bowl of veggie chili, a square of jalapeno corn bread as big as my head and a slice of chocolate rasberry pie a la mode
FOOD	[ pie ]	 It doesn't get much better than this folks!  I cannot wait to go back, I've actually had a dream about that pie!Whenever I get the chance to stop over in this great city I always try to swing by Monte's
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is friendly but don't expect to be looked into every 2 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Which personally I prefer
FOOD	[ O  ]	This has a very local feel and the prices are just right
FOOD	[ Blue Plate, egg ]	I had the Blue Plate special with egg whites
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was wonderful
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not greasy
FOOD	[ artichoke, sandwhich ]	The artichoke sandwhich is also off of the hook! Very good down home food all the way around and extremely reasonably priced
FOOD	[ O  ]	Especially coming from the West Coast
FOOD	[ O  ]	The other added bonus is Monte's is located in the Willy Street area
FOOD	[ O  ]	the more eclectic part of "downtown"
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have no idea what kind of Michelin 4-star restaurant some of these reviewers are used to, but their poor ratings of this Madison staple are not to be taken seriously
FOOD	[ O  ]	Coming from someone who's worked professionally in the food industry for the better part of the past decade, in bars, cafes, diners, organic kitchens, and hotels, this diner-style family eatery will always remain one of my absolute favorite places to go, for any meal of the day
FOOD	[ O  ]	This, more than any other restaurant in Madison, is what I missed when we moved away
FOOD	[ O  ]	Let's review:
FOOD	[ menus, dishes ]	One of the most creative, delicious, varied, and comprehensive vegetarian and vegan menus I've ever seen, especially for a place that specializes in heartwarming diner-style dishes
FOOD	[ Zucchini, Potato ]	I'm a dedicated omnivore, and my favorite things to order off the menu were the Heathen Vegan Shoplifter's Delight, and the Zucchini Potato Pancakes (both vegan)
FOOD	[ O  ]	The person who complained about the terrible service
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have no idea what she was talking about
FOOD	[ O  ]	In the 4 years I lived in Madison, I ate there on an average of once a month, and my servers were always friendly, responsive, and as prompt as could be expected during varied levels of busy-ness
FOOD	[ cook, chat ]	The cook regularly comes out to chit-chat and joke with the customers
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's always a treat
FOOD	[ O  ]	:)
FOOD	[ O  ]	They work hard to support local farmers, with dedicated local and organic specials featuring produce, meats and dairy from area growers
FOOD	[ biscuits ]	Their homemade biscuits are to DIE for
FOOD	[ O  ]	Try the pies
FOOD	[ O  ]	And the cakes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Do it
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you can't eat another bite, take a slice home
FOOD	[ O  ]	I promise, you won't regret it!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never had a disappointing meal there
FOOD	[ O  ]	I miss it like a long-lost lover
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of our favorite Madison restaurants!  Great food (most of the time) and fast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The non-booth side feels like a cafeteria, though, since the tables are so close together
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great desserts too!If I had a friend from overseas come to visit, and he asked me to show him what good American food was like, I know without a doubt this would be the place that I would display to him with great national pride
FOOD	[ O  ]	Actually, I take all my friends who come to visit Madison to Monty's
FOOD	[ diet, gluten, lent, gluten ]	I once had a friend visiting who was on a very strict diet (gluten free + fasting for lent) with me and she had a good three pages of vegetarian and gluten-free menu to choose from
FOOD	[ O  ]	This shouldn't scare off those looking for a greasy spoon, however, because you're free to order something at the complete opposite of that spectrum
FOOD	[ Bacon, cheese, french toast, chicken fried steak ]	Bacon grilled cheese, donut french toast, chicken fried steak, alcoholic milkshakes
FOOD	[ O  ]	You name it, they probably have it
FOOD	[ O  ]	My one piece of advice is that you should probably look at the menu ahead of time because it is so expansive that you could spend as much as a half hour just trying to make up your mind
FOOD	[ brunch, rush ]	Be prepared to wait a long time if coming in during the weekend brunch rush
FOOD	[ O  ]	Do not be deterred, it is completely worth every second
FOOD	[ O  ]	For what it's worth this is probably my #1 favorite restaurant in Madison, if not my favorite restaurant ever
FOOD	[ O  ]	We've eaten at Monty's a number of times and have always had good food there
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Service has also been good to excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	  The veggie quesadilla is quite good
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Their prices are a little higher than we would like
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bathroom and restaurant is very clean
FOOD	[ O  ]	When we are in the mood for something vegetarian Monty's is a safe bet
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wouldn't really say I'm a fan but they do enough right to get 4 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Been several times and always the same
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fun space, menu reads very well and you expect to get a great meal, but food is totally plain and unexciting
FOOD	[ O  ]	All hat, not cattle
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Don't waste the time or money, many better options around town
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm willing to shell out four stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have not yet had anything bad on the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The atmosphere is always pleasant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Sometimes it does feel, however, that the wait staff pulls preference on the regulars
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If I lived in the area it would be a constant
FOOD	[ O  ]	I do love how everything served is local
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The milkshakes are so close to being the best in the area
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So close
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The pies on the other hand 
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Word
FOOD	[ choice ]	If you have a choice to make for eats in that part of town,  just go
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Take it all in and be satisfied
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Also, plan on going back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not great but not bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	On the healthful side, I had a Mediterranean platter that was quite tasty
FOOD	[ hummus, quinoa, salad, cucumber, salad ]	It had hummus, quinoa salad and pita with cucumber salad
FOOD	[ O  ]	I enjoyed the fact that while this is something of an old-fashioned diner, my choices were not restricted to burgers and shakes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Although they do have shakes
FOOD	[ Cow, ice cream ]	Good looking ones at that, made with Sassy Cow ice cream
FOOD	[ blueberry, pie ]	I opted for blueberry pie and was very disappointed
FOOD	[ blueberries ]	The blueberries were of the frozen variety and sour
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was nothing to hold them together, so they fell out of the flavorless crust individually
FOOD	[ a la mode, ice cream ]	I was glad I asked for it a la mode, because the ice cream was the only thing that saved it
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had been really excited by the variety of pies and cakes at the counter but either they are not homemade or they are made by people who don't like to bake
FOOD	[ pie ]	Either way, I would not order pie here again
FOOD	[ O  ]	But I would come back for breakfast all day or some of the other menu items
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fun ambiance, particularly for kids (I was with one who thoroughly enjoyed his Mickey Mouse pancakes!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh, and they have booze
FOOD	[ breakfasts, sandwiches ]	A solid diner specializing in scratch-made breakfasts and sandwiches
FOOD	[ O  ]	The local who brought be here said that Monty's tries to use local meats, veggies, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	and I applaud that (especially in Wisconsin where all the local stuff is typically top-notch)
FOOD	[ salmon ]	I tried the Wisconsin salmon breakfast hash that was tasty and I cleaned my plate, but the dish was just a tad dry and needed a little something extra to make it more than the minced and griddled sum of its parts
FOOD	[ potatoes, Tabasco ]	Breakfast potatoes were solid and didn't provoke the usual request for Cholula/Tabasco
FOOD	[ fruit, breakfasts ]	I appreciated the fact that fresh fruit is offered as a side with most breakfasts
FOOD	[ O  ]	Definitely hit the spot
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our server was very attentive and was exceedingly patient with our sleep-deprived indecision before ordering
FOOD	[ dessert ]	After glancing at the dessert case filled with ultra-decadent delights (cupcakes, cakes, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	) I think I'd be up for returning on a future trip to Madison
FOOD	[ sugar ]	A late-night sugar fix might be more in the cards than breakfast next time, though
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food, decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Service, eh
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were on the way back from Chicago and decided to eat in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I found Monty's online so we checked it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	The neighborhood couldn't be cuter
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was noonish on a Sunday, so it was busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We waited a short time for our table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I liked how the person cleaning the table also put the silverware and water down
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It helps turn the tables over quicker and it satisfies those of us waiting
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But don't drink it all right away, you might not get more
FOOD	[ egg, sandwich, Chicken, bacon, goat cheese, sandwich, bean, salad ]	I wanted the egg sandwich, but I also wanted lunch, so I decided on the Roast Chicken, bacon (none for me thanks) and goat cheese sandwich with bean salad
FOOD	[ bean, salad ]	 Dining companion had the Turkey Club with bean salad
FOOD	[ sandwich, bread, chicken, goat cheese ]	Food arrived pretty quick and my sandwich was excellent!  The bread was toasted perfectly and the chicken was not at all dry and the smear of goat cheese was great
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 My dining companion liked his sandwich was well
FOOD	[ bean, salad, chip, dip, salad ]	  The bean salad could double as a chip dip, in fact I have a recipe just like it that I will now be serving as salad
FOOD	[ O  ]	What wasn't great was the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food got dropped off and she never came back
FOOD	[ glasses ]	 She was going to bring me more water, but we had with our glasses empty the WHOLE time we were eating
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We never saw her again
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We took out our credit card so if she did swing by she could take it and we could go
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If it weren't for the service we receive I would consider going back
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had to write a 5-star review to offset some of the poor reviews
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is probably the best restaraunt in Madison for vegetarians
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food is delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I woudn't even know which menu item to review; everything I've had is excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd like to see where some of these other reviewers recommend people eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	I always try and get here at least once when I go to Madison

FOOD	[ sugar, sausage, eggs, egg ]	(great cinamon sugar, smaller portion, tasty sausage)If you have poached eggs on your menu and do not know how to poach an egg do NOT offer it as an option
FOOD	[ spinach, mornay sauce, eggs, hard boiled eggs ]	I got the breakfast item with spinach, mornay sauce ,and poached eggs, only to receive hard boiled eggs
FOOD	[ O  ]	It completely ruined the dish and my want to ever come back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not to mention that the food is always mediocre
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not happy and not coming back
FOOD	[ O  ]	How have I never written a review for Monty's? 
FOOD	[ pie, coffee ]	Very often full of hipsters as well as old ladies having pie and coffee, Monty's is a Madison staple
FOOD	[ french toast, zucchini, potato ]	A long-time fan of their french toast, I recently discovered their zucchini and potato pancakes
FOOD	[ buttermilk ]	While I expected them to be small and dense like latkes, they were really more the size and shape of buttermilk pancakes
FOOD	[ O  ]	So much food! But really good
FOOD	[ meatloaf, meatloaf, meatloaf, sandwich ]	While I personally loathe meatloaf as a rule, my sister stands by their meatloaf and meatloaf sandwich as being the best around
FOOD	[ bacon ]	Always popular with the veggie/vegan crowd for the multitude of imitation food offerings, I stick with the bacon
FOOD	[ O  ]	Disregard the sniffy reviews by food snobs; Monty's is great at being what it is, a nouveau diner with an eclectic menu, welcoming to old and young, hipster and square, LGBT and straight,etc
FOOD	[ French toast, omelettes, dishes, meatloaf, enchiladas, chili ]	Great breakfast items (French toast,omelettes, scramblers, pancakes) available around the clock, lots of comfort food veg and non-veg dishes ("meatloaf of the gods" enchiladas, chili, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything is freshly prepared with good ingredients
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not to mention the delicious pies and cakes
FOOD	[ coffee ]	coffee is meh but that's par for diners
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices are reasonable, two can be stuffed for $30
FOOD	[ O  ]	Friendly service by the mostly college student/artsy young person staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're looking for a good solid (but not fancy-shmancy) meal on the E
FOOD	[ O  ]	Side of Madison, can't do better than Monty's
FOOD	[ pie ]	Great diner--breakfast, pie, milkshakes?! Always a good experience

FOOD	[ O  ]	I had not been here myself so I took her up on the offer
FOOD	[ coffee, fast food ]	Our food was great! Good service, great coffee, fast food prep from order to plates on the table as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had a decent flow of people coming in the whole morning as well which must say something about the place
FOOD	[ sweet potato, biscuit, honey, coffee ]	I highly suggest the sweet potato hash for breakfast and do try a biscuit or 2 as well, great with some honey and coffee! Great prices as well
FOOD	[ SWEET potato, corned beef ]	Here's a lil story about SWEET potato corned beef hash
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's will make it for you if you ask nicely
FOOD	[ O  ]	The end
FOOD	[ O  ]	Alright that was the short version for those with an inability to read more than a few lines
FOOD	[ O  ]	here's the lengthier more tasty version! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	After having some lunchie and being pleasantly surprised by their afternoon eats, I decided it was time to give MBPD a try for brekkie
FOOD	[ O  ]	Holy options batman
FOOD	[ eggs, griddle, sausage ]	This isn't your typical eggs, griddle, sausage type of place
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have some really inspired creations, and it was hard for me to pick between two
FOOD	[ corned beef, potatoes, sweet potato ]	The corned beef hash (served with typical white potatoes and the sweet potato hash
FOOD	[ meat ]	more interesting taters but no meat) Hold up, wait a minute, how do you get both? You ask nicely
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really nicely
FOOD	[ potato, meat ]	And low and behold moments later I had a plate of blended potato perfection and some chipped meat
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was rad
FOOD	[ O  ]	Deliciously rad
FOOD	[ fruit, melon, biscuit ]	And served with amazing fruit, not just crappy melon as is typical during morning meal time and the best I'M TALKING THE BEST biscuit I've ever eaten
FOOD	[ biscuits ]	And I'm a guy who's had a few biscuits in his day, so trust
FOOD	[ conversation ]	Now don't going running over there saying, "Corey said, Corey said!" But if you happen to get a nice server and you happen to strike up some nice conversation nicely ask for hot tuber take on their standards
FOOD	[ O  ]	And be nice if they charge you a little more
FOOD	[ dishes ]	They're combining two dishes to make you happy after all
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice
FOOD	[ pie ]	Stopped in this morning for breakfast and pie
FOOD	[ corned beef, home fries ]	They make great corned beef hash and home fries
FOOD	[ meat, beef ]	The meat is hand cut from locally sourced beef, and all the ingredients are fresh and tasty

FOOD	[ fruit, cream ]	Monty's offers fantastic diner food and a wide range of fruit and cream pies
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can't go wrong here
FOOD	[ Blue Plate, Corned Beef ]	Monty's Blue Plate and the Holy Grail of Corned Beef Hash
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I were to write nothing else, I think the previous sentence sums up my new found appreciation for the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	"Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries" will never be uttered to an employee of Monty's
FOOD	[ coffee, bomb ]	The service was great, my coffee cup stayed full the entire meal, and the food was 'da bomb
FOOD	[ O  ]	' 
FOOD	[ Chorizo ]	I'm eyeballing the Chorizo for my next visit, which will be sooner rather than later
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's has quickly become my "can you" place
FOOD	[ O  ]	What do I mean by that
FOOD	[ chocolate, malt, pie ]	"You know your chocolate malt pie
FOOD	[ O  ]	can you turn that into a shake?" YES
FOOD	[ onions, meatloaf, sandwich ]	"You know the fried onions that come on the open faced meatloaf sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	can you put those on a burger?" YES
FOOD	[ biscuit ]	"You know the biscuit that comes with some breakfast items
FOOD	[ biscuit ]	can I swap my diner roll for a biscuit?" YES
FOOD	[ conversation ]	The staff is extremely friendly, always up for great conversation and recently I've taken to sitting at the counter which is a blast
FOOD	[ O  ]	your meal comes with a free show!
FOOD	[ O  ]	So when I say Monty's is my "can you" place, I mean it's a place that doesn't mind me being a brat
FOOD	[ O  ]	And if they ever say no? That'll be ok with me
FOOD	[ Blue Plate ]	I may go once a week instead of my typical 3-4 (seriously how does that happen?) but I'll still go!I had attempted to go to Monty's Blue Plate Diner the last time I was in town, but it was so crowded that I was deterred and ended up at Ella's Deli for possibly the worst omelet of my life
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This time, I was determined to wait it out at Monty's for as long as it took - which ended up being only ten minutes at around 11:30 a
FOOD	[ O  ]	on a Sunday
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The wait was well worth every second
FOOD	[ meatloaf, melange, vegetables, cashew, gravy, caponata, vegetables, pesto, basil ]	 My breakfast companion and I had the meatless meatloaf - a melange of carrots and other vegetables, covered in a cashew and sage gravy - and a caponata omelet, filled with a stew of perfectly-cooked, still-easily-recognizable vegetables and a pesto sauce made from basil grown out back
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Each bite of each dish was a delight
FOOD	[ peanut butter, cheesecake ]	 I took home a slice of Reese's peanut butter cheesecake which I am hoping my son will find to be too rich for him because, uh huh!  That means I get to polish it off
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Can't wait to get back to Madison for another go-round at Monty's!Always loved this place, but last time we tried it had a terrible experience
FOOD	[ fish ]	 Wanted to order fish and was told they no longer served it
FOOD	[ fish ]	 About 5 minutes later the same waitress brings out a huge fish plate for the lady next to us
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We are like " What the HECK" ????  Needless to say if we are not good enough to eat what anyone else gets, then we are taking our business else where
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food that we got was not that great this time anyway
FOOD	[ O  ]	A diner with Food Fight style and warm service is my go-to for breakfast all day
FOOD	[ corned beef, BLT, waffle, fries ]	Beloved: corned beef hash, TNT BLT, waffle fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	A year and a half of regular visits has revealed the staff to be consistently friendly and efficient, food quality to be consistently high and prices to be reasonable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Monty's is worth the occasional short wait for a table
FOOD	[ O  ]	The great thing about this diner is the diversity of the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's tons of options to choose from so it's hard not to find something that you like
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm guessing that it was just a fluke, but my biggest complaint was that the diner was cold! It was colder inside than it was outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife and I (the people at the tables around us) had to wear our jackets the whole time
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had to scarf down my food, only couple minutes after arriving at the table it was already getting cold
FOOD	[ Salmon ]	I ordered the Wisconsin Salmon Hash and it was pretty good
FOOD	[ fillet, fish, salmon ]	I was expecting a nice fillet of fish with my hash, but the salmon was pretty skimpy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Small pieces scattered throughout
FOOD	[ pineapple, melon, biscuit ]	It came with some pineapple, melon and a biscuit
FOOD	[ fruit ]	The fruit was fresh and complimented the hash well
FOOD	[ biscuit ]	The biscuit wasn't bad but would have been much better if it had been served warm
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love diners
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I love Monty's
FOOD	[ pie, glass ]	 I especially love the pie porn lingering on the other side of the glass so you can just gaze with wonder as you wait for your cibo
FOOD	[ cheese, cheese ]	I ordered the Italian grilled cheese which had an exorbitant amount of cheese
FOOD	[ mozzarella ]	 Seriously could have served a whole Italian family, that's how much mozzarella was squished in there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Tasty? Hell yes
FOOD	[ Alcohol, wine, beer ]	Alcohol is offered, wine and beer galore
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Woohoo!One of my favorite breakfast places in Madison
FOOD	[ salmon ]	 The salmon hash is a dream
FOOD	[ biscuits, Blue Plate ]	 And Tim bakes the best biscuits in town!NEVER had a bad meal at Blue Plate
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great for any meal of the day
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service always good whether you are at a table, at the counter, or outside on the patio
FOOD	[ gluten ]	 Plenty of vegan and gluten free choices
FOOD	[ flavor ]	I have only good things to say about Monty's! If you like unpretentious food that is filled to the brim with flavor you will also like Monty's
FOOD	[ meatloaf, chicken, pie ]	We had the meatloaf and chicken in a pie at our table
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think I said "yumm" no less than 9 times
FOOD	[ turtle, cheesecake ]	really it couldn't be helped! The turtle cheesecake I got to go was also pretty spectacular
FOOD	[ O  ]	I appreciated the service as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our server was friendly and available without being overbearing
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was the perfect dinner
FOOD	[ breakfasts, smoothies, oatmeal ]	5 starts for being one of the few places I have ever been that has full on, decked out vegan breakfasts!  No wimpy smoothies or oatmeal here
FOOD	[ tofu ]	 I'm talking tofu scramble and vegan hash
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm in love
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can definitely see the appeal of Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	This delicious and clean diner serves up some tasty eats with a twist
FOOD	[ O  ]	It didn't take long for my buddy Corey D to share his love and thus I had to experience it for myself
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're not carrying a child, you must sample their drink menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	Looks super fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	Please have one for me
FOOD	[ beverages, menus ]	But beyond the cornucopia of boozy beverages lie various menus that will satisfy just about every craving
FOOD	[ savory ]	Sweet, savory, both
FOOD	[ O  ]	take your pick
FOOD	[ O  ]	During my visit, I sample the hash
FOOD	[ sweet potato, corned beef ]	but due to Corey's insight, I kindly asked if they could make my plate half sweet potato hash and half corned beef hash
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes they can, and yes they did
FOOD	[ corned beef ]	The hash was nicely crisped and the corned beef perfectly salty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Portions were sizable without being gigantic, and honestly, I kind of appreciate that
FOOD	[ corned beef ]	No one needs to start their day with 6 pounds of corned beef hash
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yikes
FOOD	[ fruit ]	The sizes were just fine - I appreciate the substitution of fruit
FOOD	[ biscuits ]	Gotta add some healthy in your meal! My main gripe is for their biscuits
FOOD	[ crumbly ]	Mine was uber dry and crumbly
FOOD	[ biscuit ]	Bummer on the biscuit, but I'm sure I'll manage
FOOD	[ O  ]	Next time I make it up to Madison, I'd happily swing back into Monty's for another scrumptious breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Maybe I'm jumping the gun with a 5 star review
FOOD	[ O  ]	oh well, life's short
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I tried this place for the first time the other week when my grandparents were visiting me in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was just wonderful!
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decor is adorable, the servers were friendly and prompt, and the food was fabulous
FOOD	[ Sandwich, mushrooms, tempeh, avocado ]	 I went with the Heathen Vegan Sandwich, which is piled high with mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado
FOOD	[ bean, salad ]	 For my side, I chose the bean salad
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Both of these items were delicious
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 The sandwich was HUGE
FOOD	[ sandwich, fork ]	 I could not eat it like a regular sandwich, so I ate it in an open-faced sort of way with a fork
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A little messy, but totally worth it
FOOD	[ mushrooms, tempeh, avocado, bread ]	 The mushrooms and tempeh were perfectly seasoned and tender and the avocado brought it all together with the toasted bread
FOOD	[ O  ]	I got a bit nervous because at the *very last second* my grandma changed her order to the exact same thing I got (she's not vegan) because she "trusts me"
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was pretty nervous, but she ended up loving it!  I was so pleased
FOOD	[ bean, salad, fork ]	 My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma's did not share that problem and it wasn't difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon
FOOD	[ O  ]	My grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased
FOOD	[ eggs, bacon, potatoes ]	 He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign
FOOD	[ eggs ]	He said the eggs were cooked perfectly
FOOD	[ O  ]	They seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Not only because I loved my vegan options, but because you made my grandparents very happy too and that rocks in my book
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I will definitely be back!Part of the Madison based Food Fight Inc (16 restaurants currently?), Monty's was the first, or one of the first
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They are all different, yet are the same in one way
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They are good places to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's is styled after a 50's diner - counter, chrome, lots of "traditional" diner foods, and a lot that you never got at a diner
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service is fast, food is good, prices are reasonable (but not cheap) and wait staff is friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Feels neighborhood friendly, although they bring in people from all over the area
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Plenty of good vegetarian options also
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is interesting, with lots of things not found in your typical diner
FOOD	[ Coffee, Coffee, coffee ]	  Coffee is from Just Coffee (that is a bonus feature people - if you like coffee, this is a great place) and many of the specials are made with organic foods
FOOD	[ meat, Walnut, meat ]	 Want a burger but don't eat meat?  Swap out the Walnut burger - which, as a meat eater, I can say is good
FOOD	[ hamburger ]	 Certainly better than their hamburger
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Speaking of which
FOOD	[ hamburger ]	What is up with that hamburger?  First off, it comes medium well done - no burger should ever be cooked to that
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Second, it is heavily, and funky seasoned
FOOD	[ O  ]	 As in, if I ordered it, it would go back
FOOD	[ salt, pepper ]	 A good burger needs salt and pepper
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They add a bunch of stuff
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However my niece who ordered it liked it, so we kept it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Deserts are very popular at Monty's, but that was our disappointment
FOOD	[ Cheesecake, carrot, cake ]	 Cheesecake was rubbery and the carrot cake was dry - stale dry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Really?  I am almost tempted to go to three stars just for that
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, I have to stick with four stars
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 Great coffee, mostly really good, and interesting, food, fast, good service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Without a doubt I will be back if in the area
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But I will skip desert
FOOD	[ O  ]	good breakfast !! good service !! good place if your in MadisonEverything I have ever tried here is delicious! The cupcakes are to die for!I've eaten at Monty's probably 3 dozen times over the past two years and I've noticed that while the quality of ingredients remains high, the preparation consistency is low
FOOD	[ potatoes ]	 One of my favorite items is their breakfast potatoes and sometimes they're perfect but often they are either raw or burnt
FOOD	[ sandwich, egg ]	 Today I ordered a breakfast sandwich and  specified the egg over hard
FOOD	[ O  ]	it was almost raw
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is also hit or miss
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Some servers are EXCELLENT, but there's this gay guy there that is just BAD
FOOD	[ coffee, zucchini ]	 He's stuck up, doesn't refill coffee (i literally had to get up and get our own), and didn't' even bother to give a damn when my wife mentioned that the zucchini pancakes were bad (they were gross)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm done with Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There's plenty of good breakfast places in Madison to give my money to
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food was delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	A touch pricey for a "diner" but worth it one we were eating
FOOD	[ mode ]	Service was good too, even when my daughter went into meltdown mode because she didn't want to leave
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been in Madison for 16 years, and this is my favorite Madison restaurant, bar none
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of my favorite places to eat
FOOD	[ Zucchini ]	  Zucchini Pancakes are awesome!!!  We mostly eat breakfast here but I'm sure lunch and dinner are just as good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Little cramped seating for four but the food makes up for any seating issue
FOOD	[ O  ]	What an eclectic menu for a diner!  The ambiance is just what you would expect from a classic 60's diner
FOOD	[ fries, corned beef ]	 I had a ruben and some fries and it was really good!  Most places use processed corned beef
FOOD	[ beef ]	 Theirs was real sliced beef
FOOD	[ O  ]	very tender and very flavorful
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Probably the best ruben I have ever had
FOOD	[ pie ]	 I had to try the pie too since they tease you with a great display right when you walk in
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The French silk was really rich and chocolaty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Definately worth the stop if you are in the area or passing through
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monday is hard for everyone
FOOD	[ O  ]	So if you ever come home from work disoriented (cuz it's Monday), Monty's there for you to take a good care of your Monday night meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	My bf and I had fantastic vegan 'breakfast for dinner' spread last night
FOOD	[ tofu, waffle, fries ]	The hash with tofu scambles + waffle fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was good, unexpectedly fabulous
FOOD	[ O  ]	The portion size is generous
FOOD	[ O  ]	I took home the left overs and lunching on it as I write this review
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bonus
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty's fruits pies are all vegan (i didn't know this)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pies are so-so for my taste, but not bad
FOOD	[ Walnut ]	Walnut Burger is the way to go
FOOD	[ bean, salad ]	Their bean salad as a side option is Delish
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not expensive, long waits on weekends in the mornings but worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Visited with my family for first time
FOOD	[ diet ]	I have vegan diet and they don't, but we ALL enjoyed our meals
FOOD	[ O  ]	Will be back!I love that this diner offers vegetarian/vegan options
FOOD	[ O  ]	Perfect for me and my omnivore hubby
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our waitress was great, too
FOOD	[ sweet potato, eggs ]	Yummy sweet potato hash, yummy eggs
FOOD	[ Biscuits, eggs, bacon, potatoes ]	Biscuits are decent! Boyfriend was happy with his meal as well (simple eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	) Service was quick and friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is overall fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	There is a hip diner atmosphere, the servers are always very attentive, and there are so many options for food!
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are several vegetarian and vegan options, for both breakfast and lunch/dinner
FOOD	[ Loaf ]	If you are (or aren't!) a vegetarian, try the Vegetarian Hash or the Meatless Loaf of the Gods
FOOD	[ O  ]	Both are insanely tasty and huge!Lots of good vegan and vegetarian options if you're in the mood for diner food
FOOD	[ O  ]	It can get really busy here on the weekends, so it's best to go at off-peak times
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, your phone won't get service inside their building
FOOD	[ O  ]	Looking for a big, hearty breakfast? Then look no further because this place has got exactly what you're looking for (and for a pretty reasonable price)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went here with my friend after a night of *ahem* good old Madison weekend fun, and this was exactly what we needed
FOOD	[ eggs, mornay, sausage, patty, eggs, English muffin ]	I got the eggs mornay, which has this sausage patty and poached eggs with this very nice sauce on top of an English muffin
FOOD	[ potatoes ]	And if that wasn't enough carbs for you, it comes with a generous helping of fried potatoes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good stuff
FOOD	[ appearance ]	Also a random note: despite its appearance as an old fashioned diner, I got a very hipster-y vibe from it once I got in
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm sad to say that after a really great first experience over one year ago, Friday night's dinner at Monty's was very disappointing and I probably won't come back any time soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The host at the counter was not friendly
FOOD	[ sandwich, bread, rock, bread ]	 My sandwich came on bread that was literally hard as a rock and then my husband was done eating before I even started my dinner because I sent it back and waited for new bread
FOOD	[ bread, sandwich, grease ]	The bread the second time around was greasy and the sandwich itself was dripping in grease
FOOD	[ O  ]	 GROSS
FOOD	[ fish ]	 My husband ordered the fish fry and they forgot part of his order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was just a bad day for Monty's
FOOD	[ dessert ]	I might be back for dessert someday
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife and i love this place for lunch or dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not so awesome on the breakfast end unfortunately
FOOD	[ O  ]	But there's a great selection for vegans and vegitarians alike
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our favorite is the Heathan Vegan
FOOD	[ sandwiches, waffle, fries ]	One of the best sandwiches ever! And that it's served with waffle fries makes it only more appealing
FOOD	[ meatloaf, gravy ]	The veggie meatloaf is also fantastic as is the gravy that's served on it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service can be a bit iffy at times
FOOD	[ O  ]	But the one time it was so terrible for us we ended up complaining we got a $25 "we're sorry" coupon
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	Over all though you can't go wrong at Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great food, GREAT service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Highly recommend!This place is always excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	   I've never left unhappy
FOOD	[ O  ]	   Even amongst so many good offerings in Madison, this diner stands out
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Plan your arrival carefully though, as there is often a long wait for tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great diner with a very creative menu
FOOD	[ eggs, bacon, tofu, zucchini, potato ]	 You can certainly get your traditional eggs-and-bacon breakfast, or you can opt for a tofu scramble or zucchini potato pancakes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What more could you ask for?  I have only eaten here for breakfast, but the desserts are tempting, too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Funky 50's vibe
FOOD	[ O  ]	Staff was excellent and educated on ingredients and choices
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really the some of the best food I've had in Madison at a veryy reasonable price
FOOD	[ coffee ]	The Vegetarian Hash is a must have !Hits: Tasty food, happy servers, bakery case, and custom blended coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	Misses: Static menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	but there are specials and it is an iconic location so maybe things shouldn't change
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Hints: Have a cup of free coffee and enjoy some social time with friends while you wait for a table
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Bottom-line: Eat, drink good coffee, and be merry
FOOD	[ O  ]	Stopped here for dinner before going out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our server was friendly and efficient
FOOD	[ O  ]	The 50's diner motif was cute
FOOD	[ gluten ]	Tons of vegetarian and gluten free options if you're into that sort of thing
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had the roasted turkey club and it was tasty
FOOD	[ dessert ]	Awesome dessert options too so save room!Have to add my voice to the chorus of MBP lovers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I somehow missed this place in the many times I've been to Madison until a few years ago
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great food, lots of vegetarian and vegan options
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	 They have breakfast all day and quite a few hot veggie sandwiches
FOOD	[ banana cream pie, fruit, ice cream ]	  I finished my meal with banana cream pie, but they have vegan fruit pies and ice cream treats
FOOD	[ meat ]	I had something to celebrate and hadn't been able to eat meat since watching a food documentary a few weeks prior, so Monty's seemed like the appropriate celebratory location
FOOD	[ teriyaki, tofu, peas, coconut ]	 I ordered their special: teriyaki tofu with peas, coconut, peppers and peanuts, served with a side of fresh pita
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The description was a little clunky--there were other ingredients in the dish description that I've since forgotten--and I got a kick out of listening to the waitress explain it to other patrons
FOOD	[ hot chocolate ]	 During a short wait, I sipped a heavenly hot chocolate
FOOD	[ hot chocolate ]	 My husband isn't a hot chocolate fan but agreed that it was really, really good
FOOD	[ milk ]	 FYI: they'll make it with soy milk if you ask
FOOD	[ tofu ]	 After the food arrived it took me two seconds to realize that the tofu was the best I'd ever tasted
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Tender, flavorful, caramelized on the outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The sauce was a little saltier than I prefer, but still quite good
FOOD	[ buttery ]	 The pita had good texture and a nice, buttery taste
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My husband enjoyed the traditional-type burger he ordered
FOOD	[ dessert ]	 Our only disappointment is that we didn't save room for dessert
FOOD	[ O  ]	Other observations:
FOOD	[ O  ]	-Going early helped avoid parking lot anxiety--they get Busy here
FOOD	[ O  ]	-Our red-haired waitress was friendly, intelligent, and overall awesome
FOOD	[ milk, hot chocolate, teriyaki, tofu ]	 Noting that I had ordered soy milk hot chocolate, she advised that the teriyaki tofu meal is prepared with a small amount of dairy
FOOD	[ O  ]	-Staff brought water to a puppy who was sitting outside with his humans
FOOD	[ salad, quinoa, lemon ]	I recently visited Monty's and had the roasted vegetable salad which came with quinoa in a lemon vinegarette dressing
FOOD	[ quinoa, sunflower ]	I loved all the different textures (chewy quinoa and crunchy sunflower seeds) but it was a little heavily dressed
FOOD	[ chocolate chip, cookie, crumbly ]	On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie, and it was kind I disappointing: dry and crumbly
FOOD	[ chocolate, chips ]	Luckily there were lots of chocolate chips in it, so it didn't go to waste!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall Monty's has food that is consistently good, fast service once seated (however I was there for lunch on a Tuesday), and reasonable prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	So, it's not like this place was ever gonna make it outta my e-gutter, cuz there's nothing really redeeming about it
FOOD	[ O  ]	You know, sometimes a craving makes one act desperately
FOOD	[ O  ]	sometimes against one's better knowledge
FOOD	[ ice, cream, beverage ]	Nevertheless, I make my way to Monty's one fine day, craving some sort of ice-cream based treat, similar to a beverage, but of a thicker consistency
FOOD	[ ice cream, caramel ]	Nothing special, just some plain old ice cream and say, caramel
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was $6
FOOD	[ O  ]	38?! Okay, so I go into a Vincent Vega state of mind, zoning out while the shake's bein' made thinking to myself "Did I just order a six-dollars n' 38 cent shake? Sure did
FOOD	[ Milk, ice cream, caramel ]	A shake? Milk, ice cream, caramel? Uh-huh
FOOD	[ O  ]	Six-dollars n' 38 cents? Yep
FOOD	[ bourbon ]	They don't put bourbon in it or anything? Nope
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just checking
FOOD	[ O  ]	smh
FOOD	[ wafer ]	Whoa, WHAT?! When it came up, it was in a small, flimsy styro cup, with a sad lil' wafer sticking out the top
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	did they just charge me like that much for this??? Ugh! I was so pissed, I told em' keep it, n' got my money back
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can get Culver's or Michael's for like, way better
FOOD	[ Chocolate, gallon, milk ]	Even the Chocolate Shoppe, or like, buy your own pint and a gallon of milk, stir in some Smucker's flavoring and have change to spare
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't even know why people like this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dude, seriously
FOOD	[ O  ]	Abundant vegan options, even for breakfast!  Food is above average, service was great, prices really low
FOOD	[ sweet potato, tofu ]	The sweet potato hash with tofu scramble was especially good
FOOD	[ banana, pie, carrot, cake ]	Their banana pie and carrot cake are SUPER!!!!!!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	and if you happen to buy the whole container, you are required to give a 5-dollar deposit which will be returned if you bring it back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh Monty, finally!
FOOD	[ O  ]	This morning, though I am still a little bit ill, I came only for you :) (and for me:))
FOOD	[ O  ]	Waiting for less than 10 minutes, we were seated by the window
FOOD	[ O  ]	A very nice spot
FOOD	[ O  ]	I decided quickly: I wanted to have a dish of scramble "something" (hahaha, I found this funny, I was wondering what "something" meant
FOOD	[ broccoli, pepper, cheese, meat ]	I asked the server and she said it is for broccoli, pepper, some cheese (and God knows what else!-- too many to list! :D) and has no meat (yay!)
FOOD	[ pesto, biscuit, biscuit, brunch ]	Hubby ordered a dish of pesto omelet! Both came with homemade biscuit- I'm in love with this biscuit right away! We enjoyed our brunch soooooooooooo much
FOOD	[ O  ]	I told the waiter: The food is excellent! I wanna come back soon!
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is a five
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is a five
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes, full score for you, Monty
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Sshhhhh, don't forget to also order their coffee and the donut
FOOD	[ coffee ]	The coffee is really an eye opener and the donut is ridiculously huge but so GOOD
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty has made my Saturday happy! and I really need that after one week of my illness :(
FOOD	[ O  ]	Mahalo, Monty!I don't understand why this place is popular
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food was bad and the service was bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I ordered a burger medium well and got it medium rare
FOOD	[ O  ]	 After sending it back and getting another it was still medium/medium rare but I was too hungry to send it back again and lost all faith in their cooks
FOOD	[ fries ]	 I think they served it on the same plate with the same cold fries as before
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My friend ordered a breakfast dish and it was terrible
FOOD	[ scrambled eggs, potatoes, biscuit, flavor ]	 The scrambled eggs were so overcooked they were hard and rubbery, the potatoes were very undercooked, and the biscuit was dry and literally had no flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	 None
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service seriously lacked as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No one was unfriendly, just incompetent
FOOD	[ dessert, cheesecake ]	We thought the dessert would redeem them but after paying so much for a single slice of cheesecake we couldn't even finish it
FOOD	[ cheesecake, sour cream ]	 One slice was dried out and the other cheesecake had too much sour cream - it was actually mushy and very sour, almost spoiled tasting
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bottom line, I found this place to be mediocre at best, and that's being generous
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's tons of better restaurants in the area and in the city
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Never going back, and I think the food has made me ill
FOOD	[ Blue plate, omelette, avocado, potatoes, biscuits ]	Blue plate omelette was delish, with avocado, pan fried potatoes and homemade biscuits
FOOD	[ almond, milk, French toast ]	We also had the almond milk French toast
FOOD	[ coffee ]	To top it off, local coffee, ground fresh with each pot! Must stop again
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have been going here since the 90s and it has been up and down
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Some ok food, some terrible
FOOD	[ fatty, meatloaf ]	 Once found fatty masses in my meatloaf
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Recently it has been just ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Inexpensive, pretty fast but low quality compared to other places on Willy street and mediocre compared to the many good options in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had a wonderful experience at Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	My server was incredibly kind, attentive, and friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	He could not have had a more pleasant demeanor
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was also quite good, and the prices are great
FOOD	[ burrito ]	I ordered the breakfast burrito and enjoyed it very much
FOOD	[ onions, meat loaf ]	I would definitely go back to Monty'sI cry sad tears at night now that I can no longer get crispy fried onions or a meat loaf sammie
FOOD	[ Salmon ]	You know what helps me sleep, though? Salmon hash
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's so inspirational I re-created the dish this weekend
FOOD	[ O  ]	3 times
FOOD	[ O  ]	For different people
FOOD	[ O  ]	(It's that good
FOOD	[ O  ]	)Fabulous, just fabulous
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service is spectacular and food is beyond amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	The wait was awhile, maybe half an hour or so but totally worth it
FOOD	[ burrito, salmon, potato, zucchini ]	The breakfast burrito, salmon hash and potato and zucchini pancakes are delectable
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was ok! Prices were reasonable
FOOD	[ almond, French toast ]	I got the almond French toast
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was simple, came with a side of fruits
FOOD	[ Coffee ]	Coffee was really strong and just what I needed for the morning
FOOD	[ steak ]	My boy friend got the steak hash
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was alright for the price, nothing special! Would I come back for breakfast? Nope!It's unique diner food in a renovated old gas station
FOOD	[ Meatloaf, wine, gravy, mashed potatoes, pie ]	They have lots of  vegetarian options and a fantastic bakery!Meatloaf with red wine gravy and amazing mashed potatoes, followed by the best bumbleberry pie ever
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best place for comfort food
FOOD	[ pie ]	Did I mention the pie??We stopped here on a road trip from Minneapolis to Chicago
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So glad we did
FOOD	[ meatloaf ]	The meatloaf was the best ever
FOOD	[ O  ]	Going to see a show or concert across the street at the Barrymore? Well, we all have to eat somewhere, why not Monty's? The first time I laid eyes on this joint, it was a few weeks ago after skipping dinner and going to Bo Burnham
FOOD	[ alcohol ]	I wondered if it was a bar or a restaurant, a week later, I found out that it's kind of both! It's a classic diner that happens to serve alcohol
FOOD	[ mushroom ]	I ordered and enjoyed the mushroom and swiss, but I came in on a mission
FOOD	[ O  ]	To order a burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their menu almost distracted me from my mission by offering breakfast all day
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh, I shall return to conquer the idea of Breakfast for Dinner another time!
FOOD	[ Waffle, fries ]	Waffle fries! need I say more on this topic? Well, its Yelp, so yes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just the right amount of crispy and not too many
FOOD	[ dessert, Oat, Fudge, fries ]	I also managed a dessert on my first visit, that portion size of the Oat Fudge Bar was enough for me to have skipped the fries or the burger, it was huge! Sadly there were nuts mixed in (personal preference), but that didn't stop me
FOOD	[ O  ]	I didn't opt-in for a shake, but I should have
FOOD	[ O  ]	All I've learned about my visit is that I will have to make another trip before my next Barrymore concert!Descriptive phrase: quaint, local diner
FOOD	[ Blue Plate ]	Monty's Blue Plate Diner is located in a quiet but neat part of East Madison, not far off Willy Street
FOOD	[ brunch ]	It looks like an old gas station (could be), and there was a 25 minute wait for Saturday brunch when we came
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's space to sit outside, or shops nearby to wander to
FOOD	[ O  ]	Inside it's classic diner, through and through
FOOD	[ O  ]	We (4 of us) were seated at a small booth
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was cozy to say the least
FOOD	[ O  ]	Katie K
FOOD	[ Chocolate ]	and I split a Chocolate Shake ($6) to start off
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's what you'd expect from the setting, served in a metal tin and absolutely delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	I as good as chugged mine
FOOD	[ Chicken, Bacon, Goat Cheese, sandwich ]	I leaned toward lunch this time around and got the Roast Chicken, Bacon & Goat Cheese sandwich ($9)
FOOD	[ O  ]	This dish was just missing a wow-factor (in addition to the Oxford-comma)
FOOD	[ goat cheese, sourdough, chicken, bacon, tomato ]	I love goat cheese, and expected so much with it melted between two pieces of sourdough and chicken, bacon, and tomato
FOOD	[ O  ]	But none of the flavors that should've been present stood out
FOOD	[ bacon, grease, bread ]	The salty bacon was lost in the grease of the bread
FOOD	[ tomato ]	There may not have been any tomato
FOOD	[ chicken ]	The chicken was bland
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	I loved the shake, and the sandwich was by no means bad, but there was no warm-feeling deliciousness I expected from a meal in such a diner
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd return, but get something else
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is AMAZING!!
FOOD	[ falafel, Blue Plate, walnut, tempeh, bacon ]	I've had the falafel wrap, Monty's Blue Plate Burger with the walnut burger and tempeh bacon and both were fabulous!!!  I had to narrow my options down to my top 6 choices before ordering
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will go back many more times so I can try everything I want to order!!
FOOD	[ banana, cake, peanut butter, chocolate, Drumstick, Peanut butter, pie, fudge ]	And oh my gosh the pies!!  Fat Elvis (banana cake, peanut butter frosting filling and chocolate frosting) and Drumstick (Peanut butter silk pie with a fudge layer in the bottom) were both delicious!  
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff is also very nice, helpful and passionate
FOOD	[ O  ]	THEY HAVE PIES AND CAKES

FOOD	[ cheese, onions ]	I don't know how to make mac & cheese with caramelized onions in it yet, but I will learn, dammit, because I have seen the LIGHT
FOOD	[ garlic bread, garlic, bread ]	The accompanying grilled garlic bread was alright, but a little chewy for my taste - I'm more of a Texas-toast-crusty-garlic-bread kinda girl
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, be SURE you get something sweet
FOOD	[ savory ]	It might feel weird to order a donut or a shake with a savory lunch or dinner meal, but you can't leave without it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just trust
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tried this place based upon the Yelp reviews
FOOD	[ O  ]	My girlfriend & I had hamburgers
FOOD	[ salad ]	I also had a salad with the best 1000 island dressing I've ever had
FOOD	[ onions ]	 My girlfriend did not want onions and her burger came out with them
FOOD	[ O  ]	They quickly brought her a new one
FOOD	[ Turtle ]	We finished up with a huge Turtle sundae we shared
FOOD	[ O  ]	Caution: this sundae is not for only one person
FOOD	[ rush ]	Our service was satisfactory and we arrived before the dinner rush (430pm), so seating was easy
FOOD	[ event ]	At 6pm, the place had a significant queue, but it was a Saturday night and the Barrymore had an event
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, the fare, the cost and the atmosphere make this a must try
FOOD	[ O  ]	Breakfast is their best offering here
FOOD	[ chicken, sandwich ]	Burgers are also good, but I was disappointed in the lack of chicken on my sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had to wait for a table at 7:30pm
FOOD	[ rush ]	Shows their business is good but I was surprised at the late dinner rush
FOOD	[ O  ]	Other people waiting for a table stole it before the waitress got their tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not the restaurant's fault but disappointed in the guests
FOOD	[ O  ]	Monty, thank you for saving my restaurant foody soul last night
FOOD	[ O  ]	After a disastrous meal at another restaurant, I was crabby, mad, moody and wanting to go home
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Luckily we drove by the shining light of the Monty's sign and pulled in to the parking lot
FOOD	[ pecan pie, a la mode ]	Grabbed a seat at the counter and ordered a piece of pecan pie a la mode for myself and my husband
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Your hostess, waitress, bus staff were all polite, welcoming, and doing their jobs
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 They refilled our coffee, checking on our food, did we need anything else?  THANK YOU!
FOOD	[ pie, ice cream, pecan ]	The pie was delicious, the ice cream melted slowly into the pecan crust and became a delicious consoling comfort food
FOOD	[ O  ]	My congratulation on being a place that I have visited for over 10 years and still makes the mark of having great staff, great food and ambiance
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That turquoise counter has never felt so good to lean my elbows on as last night
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ok, this is bad news (for me and my waistline)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Second visit to Monte's was 1/27/14 for "dinner," although I was there for some breakfast vittles
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Breakfast ALL FREAKING DAY, EVERY FREAKING DAY - hip hip hooray
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Excellent variety of breakfast grub
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Reasonable prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Servers have been friendly, efficient, and professional - just the right "warmth"
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Atmosphere is classic diner; very familiar feel to it
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Obviously shares a connection with Hubbard Ave Diner (both are FF restaurants)
FOOD	[ Sweet Potato, char, eggs ]	+ Sweet Potato Hash: perfectly seasoned, nice slight char on the veggies, eggs were ever-so-slightly overcooked but still good
FOOD	[ Burrito, chorizo, chorizo ]	+ Breakfast Burrito: I'm a sucker for these things; chorizo is just a touch greasy; left a little film in the mouth, but that's chorizo for you
FOOD	[ coffee ]	+ Good coffee, with speedy refills
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've heard the shakes and burgers are good; I'm too in love with the breakfast fare to venture to that side of the menu, but who knows
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll give into temptation at some point, I'm sure
FOOD	[ O  ]	First, the decor and the building itself is super cool
FOOD	[ O  ]	It really gives you that diner feel
FOOD	[ O  ]	The pies and desserts right when you walk in are also a great touch - they look absolutely divine!
FOOD	[ O  ]	We came on a Saturday at about 1:30
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had to wait for about 15 minutes, not too bad considering how small the space is
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was okay
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our server was friendly but we had to ask about 5 times for silverware until we actually got some
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have a great selection of breakfast items, I honestly didn't pay much attention to anything else on the menu
FOOD	[ gluten ]	They are really good about marking what is gluten-free which was super nice
FOOD	[ corned beef ]	I ordered the corned beef hash and it was very good
FOOD	[ flavor, eggs ]	The hash had great flavor and the eggs were cooked perfectly
FOOD	[ biscuit ]	The biscuit looked delicious but I of course couldn't eat it (devastating)
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of my biggest pet peeves though is when there is food on the plate that isn't meant to be eaten
FOOD	[ fruit, leaf, iceberg lettuce ]	and they put the fruit on a leaf of iceberg lettuce
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not a deal breaker obviously but something that has always annoyed me
FOOD	[ bacon, scrambled eggs ]	My boyfriend ordered the country breakfast with bacon and scrambled eggs
FOOD	[ potatoes ]	He said it was really good, especially the potatoes
FOOD	[ brunch ]	This place is officially on my radar as another great breakfast option!ah Sunday brunch back in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was really excited to try this place but I think I got slightly disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	First of all, not enough parking! Probably a total of 16 stalls in the tiny one way parking lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	so do plan on car pooling here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I circled around the street 2 times before finding a parking space on the side street about 3 blocks away
FOOD	[ O  ]	It might just be Sunday though
FOOD	[ O  ]	who knows
FOOD	[ O  ]	I do think the building and decor is kinda cool
FOOD	[ O  ]	felt like a good old diner with a retro kick
FOOD	[ O  ]	so here comes the food part
FOOD	[ corn, beef ]	I ordered corn beef hash
FOOD	[ O  ]	food was lukewarm
FOOD	[ O  ]	I usually like my hot food hot
FOOD	[ O  ]	not like somewhere between hot and cold
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was greasy too
FOOD	[ O  ]	not a fan
FOOD	[ O  ]	I did like the side fruits that came with it
FOOD	[ O  ]	def gave my greasy hash a little break
FOOD	[ dessert ]	I think I would come try their dessert next time
FOOD	[ pie ]	The pie and bakery goods look more yummy
FOOD	[ O  ]	until next time
FOOD	[ table service ]	Oh btw our waiter was really friendly and unobtrusive so if you are the type of person into good table service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best
FOOD	[ O  ]	Place
FOOD	[ O  ]	EVEEER
FOOD	[ O  ]	been going there for years and never had a single bad experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	everytime I go there i have higher expectations and they are always met
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	People here go out of their way to make sure that you like your food, waiters know evrything that goes on a sandwich down to the ingredients of the dressing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best of all the prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is so Willy-like
FOOD	[ sandwich, meatloaf, leftovers ]	do yourself a favor and try the veggie sandwich, your life will never be the same again! I pretend not to like meatloaf but if someone I'm with orders it, I make sure they don't have any leftovers
FOOD	[ O  ]	that's how good this place is
FOOD	[ Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary ]	Love this place! My favorite? Bloody Mary of course! I'd say it's the best Bloody Mary in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is always delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Staff is always friendly and helpful
FOOD	[ Blue Plate ]	In three years of going to Monty's Blue Plate Diner we never had a negative experience
FOOD	[ gluten ]	Nice atmosphere and fantastic food!  And I love their gluten free options
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They made things as we ordered them and the service was prompt and friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is a really nice "diner" with nice decor and a very friendly atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The line was very long on Sunday morning but that's the sign of anything good because everyone wanted to eat there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nom nom, we'll be back! :)This is just an average place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its not bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	Parking is free, small lot but street parking around the area is possible
FOOD	[ brunch ]	Went there for brunch
FOOD	[ bacon, Bloody Mary ]	Hippy looking teenage waitress was patronizing, Couldn't serve me a side of bacon with my Bloody Mary before my entree for whatever reason
FOOD	[ Biscuit ]	Biscuit was dry, really nothing special
FOOD	[ Salmon, salmon, potatoes, onion ]	Salmon hash was average and not very many salmon pieces, mostly potatoes and onion
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was tasty none the less
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quantity was less than average
FOOD	[ Bacon ]	Bacon was just like what they serve at my hospital cafeteria, nothing special
FOOD	[ brunch ]	There was a 25 minute wait which is always expected at a good brunch place
FOOD	[ Bloody Mary ]	Bloody Mary was average as well
FOOD	[ brunch ]	When I think of brunch I expect a quantity and quality as I am combining both meals
FOOD	[ O  ]	Here Quantity was slightly less than average, and quality was average
FOOD	[ O  ]	Noise level- Noisy, 
FOOD	[ O  ]	They take cards including AMEX
FOOD	[ O  ]	Have no idea why this place is so popular
FOOD	[ pancake ]	Probably people haven't been to Original pancake house, much better service and far better food and cheaper too (they take only cash)We tried this place out for the first time on a Saturday in March
FOOD	[ O  ]	From the reviews I had read on here, I knew there would be a short wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think we waited about 20-30 minutes (which was a little longer than i was expecting)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Unfortunately there was no good place to wait either
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We constantly felt we were standing in someone's way
FOOD	[ O  ]	The wait did give us a chance to admire their beautiful looking pies, which we did not have room to try after we had lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	When it was our turn, someone called our names over a microphone and then told us  where to go sit
FOOD	[ O  ]	We found our seats and waited for the waiter
FOOD	[ menus ]	There were 3 menus at the table so we were able to start looking through what they had to offer
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waiter came and took our drink order but never brought us a fourth menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	He also never introduced himself
FOOD	[ milk shakes, ice ]	After looking over the entire menu the only thing that really jumped out at me was their milk shakes and ice creams
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing else really jumped out at me and made me think "Oh wow that is really different and sounds really good?"
FOOD	[ gluten ]	I think it is a good basic breakfast place to those who are vegetarians or gluten free! But for the rest of us it isn't anything spectacular
FOOD	[ omelette, biscuit ]	I had an omelette which was fine, though the biscuit that came with it was tasty
FOOD	[ coffee, dishes, cream, sugar ]	My friend had asked the waiter for a refill on his water which never came and my coffee never got refilled until we had finished eating after all the dishes and utensils were taken away so i couldn't stir my cream or sugar
FOOD	[ O  ]	To sum things up:
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place was just an average diner that didn't have a wow factor to anything
FOOD	[ gluten ]	Would be a good place for those seeking vegetarian/gluten free options and are just wanting  "normal/ordinary" breakfast/lunch options
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would not venture back for a second time
FOOD	[ O  ]	My old supervisor took me and my ex-fiance' here shortly after I started working for her
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was really good diner food, and was very easy on the pocket book
FOOD	[ O  ]	I haven't been back since, but I wouldn't hesitate to stop by if I was in the area and craved diner fare :)Everything about this place was mediocre
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was mediocre, the ambiance was mediocre and the service was mediocre
FOOD	[ pie ]	Fantastic pie! And food
FOOD	[ O  ]	And the servers were awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now there's needs to be one in Indiana
FOOD	[ O  ]	And Ohio
FOOD	[ O  ]	In general they should just be everywhere
FOOD	[ O  ]	Breakfast heaven
FOOD	[ French Toast, hash browns ]	Grab the French Toast and a side of hash browns

FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is consistently good
FOOD	[ brunch ]	We often go for weekend brunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm from NJ, which has a lot of 24 hour diners
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is one of the only places in Madison that offers breakfast all day, so it's great in my book
FOOD	[ doughnuts ]	Don't come if you mind long lines or kids; do come if you like yeasted doughnuts!Hate the wait, but love the place all the same
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great, great food and convenient to Olbrich Gardens
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place has awesome decor
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great parking
FOOD	[ O  ]	Awesome staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	Mediocre food
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like Monty's! Great atmosphere, yummy desserts, and good burgers
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of my favorite places in Madison
FOOD	[ artichoke ]	You can never go wrong with an artichoke sand which and some crisscuts (they are worth the extra money)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like it here, but I don't love it
FOOD	[ meatloaf, meatloaf ]	Nothing really stands out to me, although my friend swears by the meatloaf (I refuse to order meatloaf in a restaurant)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will continue to got back, but I won't go out of my way
FOOD	[ Blue Plate ]	Monty's Blue Plate is a local gem
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Expect unique menu items that focus on tasty, healthy, and fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have things like burgers that you would expect at any diner but they do their own unique spin on standards
FOOD	[ onions, herbed, goat cheese, spinach ]	 My latest meal was a burger with carmelized onions, herbed goat cheese, and spinach
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Sooo good
FOOD	[ bean, salad ]	 They are also sort of famous for their bean salad - even my two year old goes for that one
FOOD	[ O  ]	After your meal you have an array of some of the best cakes and pies
FOOD	[ carrot, cake ]	 Their carrot cake is the best I have ever had and sometimes we will go there just for that!Great food and great atmosphere! Always fun!Eh it was okay
FOOD	[ O  ]	Maybe I should have ordered breakfast as that looks like that's what they are known for
FOOD	[ O  ]	But I was there at lunch time and craved a burger so that's what I ordered
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was ok nothing special to brag about
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would probably go there again but for sure going to try the breakfast
FOOD	[ Meatloaf, meat, meatloaf ]	Shut your mouth!  Meatloaf of the Gods!  There are three types of meat rolled into this meatloaf
FOOD	[ wine, gravy, mashed potatoes ]	 It comes with a red wine gravy, mashed potatoes and veggies
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All of this for $10
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Yup, a complete, well-rounded, mouth watering meal for just $10
FOOD	[ broccoli ]	The broccoli was blanched rather than steam
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So it was not mushy
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is incredible
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The people are friendly and the food comes up fast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have nothing but good things to say
FOOD	[ date ]	 On a date?  With family?  Have a small child?  Check this place out
FOOD	[ O  ]	They get desserts from a local bakery
FOOD	[ carrot, cake ]	 The carrot cake is ridiculous
FOOD	[ cake, pie ]	 Are you full from your meal?  Take cake or pie to go
FOOD	[ snack ]	 Seriously, you will not regret a snack for later
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had a great meal with some old friends who adore this place, and I can see why
FOOD	[ O  ]	Imagine a retro diner that serves breakfast all day 
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	and lots of sandwiches, burgers and other entreees 
FOOD	[ O  ]	and several vegetarian and vegan options 
FOOD	[ O  ]	and has a killer bakery 
FOOD	[ chalk ]	and allows kids to play with sidewalk chalk outside
FOOD	[ BLT, tempeh, almond, milk, french toast, biscuit ]	What's not to love? I really wanted to try the TNT BLT or the GBLT (clever), but they ran out of tempeh, so I chose the almond milk french toast, which was divine, and a biscuit
FOOD	[ pie ]	I really wanted a slice of pie, but was worried about drifting into a food coma on the drive back to Chicago
FOOD	[ O  ]	Next time 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love this place and go all the time
FOOD	[ meat ]	I am vegetarian and it is a great spot to eat with my meat eating friends
FOOD	[ dishes ]	It has a good mix of veggie friendly food and meaty dishes
FOOD	[ banana, walnut ]	Had the vegan banana walnut pancakes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Delicious!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was fast and polite
FOOD	[ bun ]	My partner had the morning bun
FOOD	[ O  ]	 VERY GOOD
FOOD	[ O  ]	They were out of the homemade donuts by 11:00AM :( - get there early to try those!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I knock off one star because they were really good but not the best
FOOD	[ O  ]	Absolutely amazing
FOOD	[ meatloaf, broccoli, gravy, mashed potatoes ]	100% real food, and a menu that can fit almost any dietary need! My partner had the meatloaf (with luscious broccoli--- try saying that in the same sentence), superb homemade gravy, and real mashed potatoes with the skins on them
FOOD	[ salad, salad ]	I had the Cobb salad, and if you are a foodie, you know that Cobb salad is a dangerous thing to put on a menu--- it is difficult to execute properly, and this was perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	We will be back, again, and again, and again
FOOD	[ O  ]	wish we had found this years ago!Loved going to this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	As a night shift worker, this was the best place for a good breakfast and good drink
FOOD	[ O  ]	Recommend highly!1st off, Breakfast all day 24/7
FOOD	[ O  ]	Who doesn't love that!
FOOD	[ O  ]	2nd, The pies selection is fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	I found out that they come from the Market Street bakery in Sun Prairie
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hats off to them!!!!! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Burgers and dinner menu- Great home cooking! fresh well made food that gives mom's at home cooking a run for it's money! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	"If you are hungry for a great filling meal, just head to Monty's" is my new Motto
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love the huge parking lot! Easy in and out every time (if you can find a spot due to me being not the only other person loving this joint)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wish they had later hours
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are only open to 10pm, which I'm kind of confused with considering they are directly across from the Barrymore theater
FOOD	[ O  ]	But
FOOD	[ O  ]	I still have a solid 5 stars for this new love of my life
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	So when that BBQ Joint was randomly closed on a Friday night- we would up here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had not been here in a few years so forgot how vegetarian friendly this place is
FOOD	[ meat ]	If you are a vegetarian this place is great, but if you are meat eat- this place is also good
FOOD	[ O  ]	They do comfort food in good portions at reasonable prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is not spectacular, its not taking you back to Grandma's kitchen
FOOD	[ O  ]	But if you go here often- I can see it turning to the neighborhood joint, when you feel like home
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can bring your friends or family, and have a decent meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	But given I live across the city-that's not going to be me
FOOD	[ O  ]	So i judge it just purely based on the food, and on this particular day- it was as Yelp puts its "A-Ok
FOOD	[ fries ]	I got the Bistro Burger with fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was cooked how I like it
FOOD	[ O  ]	My husband got the Roast Turkey Platter- it was really tender but a little bland for my taste
FOOD	[ O  ]	As Elizabeth said- the brocolli was good
FOOD	[ O  ]	The blanching makes a huge difference
FOOD	[ mashed potatoes ]	The mashed potatoes decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service acceptable
FOOD	[ choice ]	I would go back but it would not be my first choice
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is absolutely what you want it to be
FOOD	[ O  ]	It embodies the era of diners so well
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was delicious
FOOD	[ Cheese, Cheese, bacon ]	I have had the Grilled Cheese and the Mac and Cheese (I added bacon, yum!) both were wonderful
FOOD	[ O  ]	The milkshakes and malts are amazing as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	It can definitely get loud and sometimes there's a wait, but either way it is definitely worth it for this Madison gem
FOOD	[ O  ]	I always have awesome food here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am ready to start tryign out awesome coctailsgreat diner with good veggie and vegan options
FOOD	[ O  ]	overall very nice staff, friendly, prompt
FOOD	[ diet ]	great desserts!Driving back from Wisconsin Dells to Illinois hungover and following a strict vegetarian diet, can be a little tricky
FOOD	[ O  ]	I hadn't been to Madison in a few years, so we decided to try a place in Madison (I also figured that they would be more likely  to have restaurants that cater to my needs)
FOOD	[ O  ]	My boyfriend did some yelping, and shortly we were on our way to Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	There is a private lot which is always nice when you're in a busy city
FOOD	[ O  ]	We did not sit outside because it was a little chilly but the patio looked pleasant and relaxing with beautiful flowers
FOOD	[ O  ]	When you go inside the ambience is a funky little 50's diner with amazing looking pies
FOOD	[ O  ]	Even though the restaurant was crowded, we were able to get a table fairly quickly
FOOD	[ gluten ]	As I opened up the menu, I almost died but before that I even thought of moving to Madison right away! There are so many vegetarian, vegan, gluten free options that it is the majority of the menu, which is so rare to find at a breakfast diner
FOOD	[ sweet potato ]	We both ordered the sweet potato hash and it was to die for! Just what we needed that day! I wish there was another one in Illinois
FOOD	[ fruit ]	My only suggestion is to serve the fruit on a separate plate instead of piling it all on one big plate, that makes the food messy and crowded
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have a love/not love relationship with Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	I used to love them for b-fast when I ate omlets
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now that I'm vegan, it's kinda hard to love them
FOOD	[ onions ]	Many of the items can't be changed, so if you're not a fan of onions or even allergic to them, they can't come out of items because they are pre-made in batches
FOOD	[ ditch ]	They are my last ditch place to go to if Lazy Jane's, The Green Owl or any other place is busy or closed
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had to visit this place while in town based on a recommendation from a good friend
FOOD	[ sesame, chicken, salad, brandy ]	I had the sesame chicken salad and a brandy alexander to drink-- both tasted great
FOOD	[ meatloaf, cashew, ginger, gravy ]	but wish I would have ordered the vegetarian meatloaf with cashew-ginger gravy, as I tasted my friend's and it was SPECTACULAR! Unlike anything I ever had-- I've been craving it since we were there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cute/comfortable/casual atmosphere, polite and pleasant server, good/unique variety and great vegetarian options-- highly recommend this place if you're looking for comfort-type food and/or a place that feels low-key
FOOD	[ brunch ]	Came in for brunch today and had a very nice experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I really like their décor, classic diner style
FOOD	[ Meatloaf, gravy, Egg, Mornay ]	 I got the Meatloaf and oh my goodness it was so AMAZING! The homemade gravy was to die for!  My friend got the Egg Mornay I didn't try it but it looked delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our server Eric was also amazing! I will definitely be returning soon, for a first time experience I give five stars! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	As a side note as we were walking out every single employee that we passes said, "Thank you, have a great day
FOOD	[ O  ]	"I love this place! They have amazing cheesecakes, breakfast options and yummy sammies
FOOD	[ chicken, goat cheese, sandwich ]	My favorite thing to eat is the grilled chicken and goat cheese sandwich! The flavors are so fresh and work well
FOOD	[ raspberry, cheesecake ]	I also love to sneak raspberry cheesecake when I am done ;)It's always fun to take people to Monty's
FOOD	[ O  ]	The parking lot is a good indicator of how busy the place will be
FOOD	[ O  ]	Be aware, though, that the booths have very little tummy room, especially for those of us who aren't so svelte
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you fall into that category, try to get a table on the left side of the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Your ego will thank me later
FOOD	[ O  ]	:-)I could have sworn I wrote a review?
FOOD	[ O  ]	anyhoo
FOOD	[ O  ]	went here on the suggestion of a few vegheads
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	 they used to have vegan milkshakes & ice cream
FOOD	[ O  ]	sadly, no more :(
FOOD	[ sandwich, cherry, pie ]	dinner was tasty, though-- heathen vegan shoplifter sandwich & cherry pie!!! nothing Earth-shattering, but solid
FOOD	[ O  ]	and probably one of your vegan best options in Madison
FOOD	[ brunch ]	This place has really great brunch
FOOD	[ alcohol, bottled beer ]	 They also serve alcohol (bottled beer and spirits only)
FOOD	[ Bloody Mary ]	 I had their Bloody Mary and an omlet last time I was there and it just felt right
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Try having that experience at a Perkins or Dennys
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not happening
FOOD	[ O  ]	(P
FOOD	[ O  ]	the omlets are amazing, and if you ask for jalapenos on the side, they are fresh cut which rocks socks in my opinion)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, the place is very natural, with all of its ingredients seemingly sourced locally or something - the ingredients are fresh is what I mean to say
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not even comparable to a Denny's, so don't let me above reference scare you
FOOD	[ doughnut ]	As everyone in Madison knows, there are no doughnut chain stores around
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No Krispy Kreme
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No Dunkin Donuts
FOOD	[ doughnuts ]	 Although I know that the best doughnuts in town are from the Greenbush Bakery, sometimes it's just easier to go with the place down the street
FOOD	[ O  ]	That basically sums up the People's Bakery
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When you're too lazy to go anywhere else, they are pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Kind of tucked away and hard to notice, especially being next to the really glammed out Ella's Deli
FOOD	[ gyro, kebab ]	But worth a visit if you're looking for a good gyro or kebab
FOOD	[ O  ]	:]
FOOD	[ O  ]	The donuts are alright too
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have a wide variety! Myself, I really rather like their cookies
FOOD	[ baklava ]	They also offer homemade baklava
FOOD	[ sandwiches, fries ]	Really though I can reccomend their sandwiches with a side of the seasoned fries
FOOD	[ potato, falafel, sandwiches ]	Quite yummy! Vegetarian options also available such as potato kahbi or falafel sandwiches
FOOD	[ beverages ]	And they had a lot of beverages to choose from too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Although the location is not ideal, it's worth a stop if you're in that part of town
FOOD	[ O  ]	:]I've been lamenting the lack of Mediterranean establishments on the Eastside for a while
FOOD	[ Indian ]	We have arguably the best Thai, Indian, Nepali, Jamaican, Japanese, Chinese and American restaurants in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	But Downtown and the Westside both hold the Mediterranean trump card
FOOD	[ O  ]	Then I discovered People's Bakery
FOOD	[ pastry, gyros ]	How can you go wrong? Fresh pastry AND gyros? Wait
FOOD	[ gyros ]	Did I say gyros? Yes, I did
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	No longer do you have to venture downtown to get said sandwich
FOOD	[ grease, bomb ]	And the one I had wasn't a ticking grease bomb!
FOOD	[ red lentil, soup ]	Do yourself a favor when you go and try the red lentil soup
FOOD	[ flavor, cumin ]	The flavor is excellent and there's plenty of cumin to spare
FOOD	[ gyro, bowl, soup, coffee, choice ]	Delicious! My gyro and bowl of soup plus coffee was under $10, so it's a great choice when you're low on cash and need a filling lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	(Oh, and it's right next to El Pescador, across from the Madison East Shopping Center
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pretty easy to miss when driving
FOOD	[ O  ]	)Yum
FOOD	[ chocolate ]	Very good chocolate glazed donut
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Decent coffee, though nothing fancy and I like it much stronger
FOOD	[ falafel ]	Will try their falafel soon
FOOD	[ doughnuts ]	The doughnuts are good (and pretty cheap!), but I really love this place for a quick, cheap lunch
FOOD	[ falafel, gyros ]	 They make their falafel and gyros fresh, so be prepared to wait a few minutes for them to put 'em together
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There's a small dining area, or you can take your food to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The owners are friendly and efficient
FOOD	[ bread, doughnuts ]	The only thing I really wish this place would do is make fresh bread and rolls, but it's strictly doughnuts and sweet pastries here
FOOD	[ Gyros ]	Best Gyros, hands down
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And reasonably priced too
FOOD	[ chicken, sandwiches ]	 Good chicken sandwiches
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And their mediteranian entrees are delicious as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 As for the donuts, they are above average but not amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The owners are so kind
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I like going here
FOOD	[ O  ]	good food and very cheap
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Since moving to the east side I have started to go here almost every Saturday morning to pick up a couple of donuts and a coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had absolutely no idea that it existed until a cabbie friend of mine told me it was one of his favorite places to stop between fares
FOOD	[ O  ]	(Can I just say that cabbies are amazing? They know where everything is, and they know about all the cool hidden spots that most of us pass up every day
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you know a cabbie, pick their brain sometime
FOOD	[ O  ]	You will probably discover at least one awesome place because of them
FOOD	[ O  ]	So, back to People's
FOOD	[ O  ]	The donuts are really top notch
FOOD	[ O  ]	Chewy, moist, iced just enough, and they have a ton of options
FOOD	[ cream ]	I really think that their plain glazed and their boston cream donuts are the best
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their glazed donuts have this bit of crispiness to them that is amazing
FOOD	[ fritters ]	The fritters aren't as good as Greenbush, but still tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are also some specialty desserts that I am unsure of, but will have to try some day
FOOD	[ gyros, Gyro ]	As far as the food goes - the gyros are among the best I have had in town (right up there with Gyro House) but that is all I have tried there so far
FOOD	[ gyros ]	So, to sum it all up: good gyros, great donuts, fair prices, and great (but sort of slow) service
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is definitely worth checking out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great Donut & drink selection, and the food is cooked right in front of you
FOOD	[ Gyros ]	The place is a little out of the way, the only thing that youll see is a neon 'Gyros' sign in the window, but its worth stopping by
FOOD	[ O  ]	The people are very friendly, and the value is the best for the immediate area( and this is from a UW student who frequents the nearby TacoBell trying to slim budget
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only thing I can think of against the place are the hours- I really wish they stayed open longer! I cant count how many times ive been returning from groceries or whaterver and passed by the place, closed, and realized my dinner options were slim to none
FOOD	[ O  ]	One can hope for the futre though, and if youre ever around stop in, the donuts(hard to come by since I moved to Madison- just imagining maybe) alone are worth a trip
FOOD	[ dishes ]	I usually go here because they have some Halal dishes but it's definitely not my "go -to" place for Halal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I find that I have to be in the mood for it in order to really enjoy it
FOOD	[ chicken, kefta, rice ]	 However, my husband swears by their chicken and I do really enjoy their kefta with rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	Updated review,
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have to give them more stars
FOOD	[ dishes ]	For one they have pretty tasty food once I tried more dishes
FOOD	[ cucumber ]	 The cucumber sauce on the side also really good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It has also become my stop for mousaka! MmmmThe food and service attitude is pretty good for the price you pay
FOOD	[ beverages ]	They also got all kinds of beverages to go with your meal
FOOD	[ cook ]	They cook it fresh after you place an order
FOOD	[ O  ]	The owners are very nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had the vegetarian meza
FOOD	[ O  ]	Everything tastes good, though I've definitely had better middle eastern food before
FOOD	[ O  ]	But for the price you pay, the food is well worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	All the basics are done right, e
FOOD	[ dolma, hummus, kabob, cucumber, yogurt, kofta ]	dolma, hummus, kabob/shawarma, cucumber yogurt, kofta, kebbi, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	But I will mention stuff they could improve a bit more:
FOOD	[ red pepper ]	The red pepper paste was a bit bitter, but taste fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tabouli was a bit saucy (ask them to use less dressing)
FOOD	[ falafel, gyros ]	I haven't had any of the falafel or gyros here
FOOD	[ O  ]	yet
FOOD	[ doughnuts ]	 I have had the opportunity to fatten myself up that much more by eating some of their delicious doughnuts
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They are really cheap AND really good
FOOD	[ O  ]	The owners are a friendly, older couple who look like they are workin' hard
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I asked if they would be my new parents, and they just laughed, but I was serious
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Will you be my new mom and dad?  Or how about my new granny and papa?  I won't ask for money
FOOD	[ doughnuts ]	just doughnuts!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm toilet trained
FOOD	[ glass ]	*knocking on glass window*
FOOD	[ falafel, gyros ]	Please???We will drive from Dudgeon Monroe to the East side for good falafel and gyros
FOOD	[ Biryani ]	The quality and service at People's Bakery are a great reminder why the (much closer) Biryani doesn't deserve our business
FOOD	[ babaganoush, dessert ]	Skip the babaganoush, but make sure to grab a sweet treat for dessert instead!The donuts are amazing and super-fattening of course, but then I guess you shouldn't be eating donuts if you are concerned with your weight
FOOD	[ gyros, gyros, flavor ]	I agree it is by far the best gyros in town, I am originally from Chicago and am used to the quality of gyros found all over Chicagoland, this is cut the same, same thickness, same style, the flavor is similar, but has it's own thing going on
FOOD	[ gyros, gyros ]	Either way, that Parthenon in Madison is crap, people rave about it, what a joke, they have no clue what good gyros is, take a road trip and go eat at Hubs in Chicago, then you will know finally what great gyros is
FOOD	[ O  ]	In the meantime, if you are stuck in Madison, this is by far the best you will find, don't waste your money and calories elsewhere
FOOD	[ Falafel ]	Falafel is good, has it's own unique recipe, works for me
FOOD	[ Chicken, heat ]	Tan Tan Chicken is very good too, highly spiced, which I like, although not spicy as far as heat is concerned
FOOD	[ garlic, dip, Chicken, chicken ]	Comes with an awesome garlic dip, which I've only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible middle-eastern chicken ever
FOOD	[ O  ]	They even made a "Curb Your Enthusiasm" episode about it in 2011
FOOD	[ Chicken, garlic, dip, hummus ]	If you get out to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best ever
FOOD	[ O  ]	Almost enough to make me want to move back to LA
FOOD	[ O  ]	In fact
FOOD	[ O  ]	Anyway, People's Bakery is truly a gem in Madison, amongst all the questionable eateries, which some say are great, others say bad, this one is clearly a huge winner
FOOD	[ O  ]	And it is a real Mom & Pop, literally they made all the food for me, super friendly, down to Earth, real people who deserve to have your business
FOOD	[ O  ]	Go there now!
FOOD	[ hummus, dishes ]	I also liked a bunch of other stuff there, the hummus, side dishes, veggie mezza, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	Probably can't go wrong with anything there
FOOD	[ gyros, falafel ]	Great place to go for gyros, falafel, and lots of other delicious Mediterranean / Lebanese food that's worth trying
FOOD	[ bucks ]	Also, the food is really cheap - you can get a whole huge bag of great food for under 20 bucks
FOOD	[ O  ]	An older Lebanese couple run this place - they are very nice and do a good job
FOOD	[ baklava ]	As far as the bakery items, go with twisty donut things w/ the red strip down the middle or the baklava
FOOD	[ O  ]	wasn't sure what to expect, but the food was EXCELLENT
FOOD	[ O  ]	 personal service from the husband & wife owners make you feel right at home
FOOD	[ O  ]	 the tabouleh and hommos definitely rival anyplace i've ever tried
FOOD	[ O  ]	 they actually make the tabouleh to order!!!  incredibly fresh and delicious
FOOD	[ baklava ]	 delicious baklava!  and, although i didn't try any, the donuts also looked amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	 might have to stop back and pick up a dozen, for the road
FOOD	[ Mexican, buffet ]	Now this is what I'm talking about!!  Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Start with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names
FOOD	[ O  ]	This was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good
FOOD	[ lentil, soup, appetizer, hummus, falafel ]	 I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel
FOOD	[ O  ]	   
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quick review:
FOOD	[ lentil, soup ]	- lentil soup
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Awesome, just awesome
FOOD	[ saffron, color, lentils, cumin, lemon, heat, pepper ]	 Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper
FOOD	[ soup ]	 This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	50, you get a pint
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Moohamara
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I wasn't going to get this
FOOD	[ bell pepper, dips ]	 I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu
FOOD	[ COW ]	 And holy COW was she right
FOOD	[ red pepper, pomegranate ]	 A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful
FOOD	[ Falafel ]	- Falafel
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture
FOOD	[ falafel, tahini, yogurt, mint sauce ]	 Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce
FOOD	[ leftovers, tahini ]	 But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce
FOOD	[ Hummus ]	- Hummus
FOOD	[ hummus ]	 You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me
FOOD	[ chick peas, Bloody Mary ]	 I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others)
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today
FOOD	[ hummus ]	 I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days
FOOD	[ flavor, flavor ]	 This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored
FOOD	[ lemon, salt ]	 I added some lemon and salt, which helped some
FOOD	[ flavor ]	Sarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture
FOOD	[ yogurt ]	 These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce
FOOD	[ lemon ]	 I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine
FOOD	[ rice, risotto ]	 These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful
FOOD	[ O  ]	All in all, outstanding
FOOD	[ shish, baba ]	 Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj
FOOD	[ O  ]	After moving from Chicago to Madison, I thought that I would be safely tucking my Lebanese palate into the furthest recesses of my tongue, saving it only for the occasional trips back to Kedzie Avenue
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That was, until my wife and I discovered People's bakery
FOOD	[ Salam ]	Upon walking in, I was thrown back into the likes of such wonderful restaurants as Salam and Semiramis
FOOD	[ O  ]	but with Donuts!  We were genuinely welcomed in and I knew People's Bakery was gonna be one of my new spots, having not even tried a single thing in the store
FOOD	[ O  ]	We ordered a lunch "to-go
FOOD	[ Shish, Chicken, falafel, sandwich, Hummus ]	"  I got a Shish Taouk (commonly known as a Chicken Shawarma) and my wife got a falafel sandwich and we split a side of Hummus
FOOD	[ Shish, chicken, tomatoes, lettuce ]	 Well, my Shish Tauok was plump with heavily marinated, tender chicken slices, tomatoes, tahina, and lettuce
FOOD	[ O  ]	 In short, it was outstanding
FOOD	[ acidity ]	 Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity
FOOD	[ falafel, sandwich ]	 My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur
FOOD	[ hummus ]	 The hummus was really good, and the spike of sumac was a nice touch, although it was tad bit to lemony for me
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nonetheless, this is an AWESOME Madtown ethnic eats spot
FOOD	[ O  ]	and oh yeah
FOOD	[ O  ]	how can  completely dismiss the incredible homemade donut selection?  They looked stunningly good, but we both left that for another day
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Lebanese food and donuts
FOOD	[ O  ]	a winning combination, in my book
FOOD	[ O  ]	Who says donuts and Lebanese food don't go together?!  People's Bakery has made me a believer of this magical combination! This place is great for some affordable, delicious Lebanese food, and some of the best donuts in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	The outside (and inside) is unassuming, but the food is authentic (as far as I know) and yummy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pros
FOOD	[ O  ]	- VERY affordable
FOOD	[ O  ]	- friendly and helpful staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Did I mention it is scrumptious?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cons
FOOD	[ O  ]	- service is a little slow
FOOD	[ O  ]	- inconsistent drink options
FOOD	[ falafel, fritter, dessert ]	I highly recommend trying their falafel with a fritter for dessert
FOOD	[ O  ]	great donuts
FOOD	[ gyros ]	great gyros
FOOD	[ O  ]	and the most adorable owners ever
FOOD	[ rush ]	just make sure you aren't in any rush, if you think about ordering food here
FOOD	[ O  ]	still worth visiting
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is so accidental hipster, and defies categorization
FOOD	[ O  ]	Is it a diner? A bakery? An auntie's living room? Let's just say if a donut shop and a small restaurant played Tetris, this would be the result
FOOD	[ cooler, cups, tea, cups, feet, coffee ]	The eating area is quiet - no music, just the drink cooler humming - and the experience eclectic - mismatched formica tables, plastic cups for water, and tea cups with feet for the Turkish coffee
FOOD	[ coffee, cardamom ]	The Turkish coffee was weaker than expected, but wonderfully aromatized with cardamom
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was so much food my eyes pin-balled for a minute
FOOD	[ red lentil, soup, lentils, bowl, bowl, bowl ]	The red lentil soup made with sprouted lentils came in a bowl - a real bowl, not a cup-sized bowl
FOOD	[ gyro, eggplant, potato, tomato, casserole, rice ]	We also had the gyro plate which was satisfying, and mousaka entree which was like an eggplant, potato, and tomato casserole over yellow rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals
FOOD	[ fritter ]	We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter
FOOD	[ O  ]	Plus the two coffees, the total came out to be $25 (!!) and some change
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is a relaxed pace, but the owners were charming and seemed to enjoy us enjoying their food
FOOD	[ O  ]	My five-star ratings often depend on how likely and how often I would return, and this place definitely makes the twice-a-month cut
FOOD	[ O  ]	Donuts as BIG as your head!  Fresh Lebanese food made to order made by the friendly owner!  Such was my experience today at People's Bakery
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I don't really understand why the place was so empty today but it was fine with me
FOOD	[ tabbouleh, baba, hummus ]	 I ordered tabbouleh, baba ghanoush, hummus, pita and a giant donut!   You'd never think we would have authentic Lebanese in a generic looking mini mall in Wisconsin but we do-I feel lucky it's just a few blocks away from my house
FOOD	[ containers ]	Downside = Styrofoam containers
FOOD	[ O  ]	I might attempt to bring my own next time to avoid them!Went there today with my fiance
FOOD	[ hummus, lamb, felafel ]	 We had the hummus and lamb and the felafel
FOOD	[ lamb ]	 The lamb was amazing
FOOD	[ hummus ]	 Little pieces cut up and placed on a bed of hummus
FOOD	[ hummus ]	 The hummus was very smooth and great texture
FOOD	[ hummus ]	 The hummus was good, but Bunky's is still my favorite in town
FOOD	[ felafel ]	The felafel was good, not too heavy
FOOD	[ pita bread ]	 Serve in pita bread with a sauce and veggies
FOOD	[ beverages, lemonade ]	 They have a good selection of beverages, they had my favorite Nantucket Nectar and some good bottled lemonade
FOOD	[ O  ]	After our main course we decided to try some pastries
FOOD	[ baklava ]	 The baklava was amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was light and flavorful
FOOD	[ doughnut ]	 We also had a french glazed doughnut which was better then Greenbush
FOOD	[ O  ]	The lady that works the counter is very friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When we went back to purchase the pastries we only had credit cards, and they have a $5 minimum
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She let us just add it to the tip of our original bill!So good!!! We went as a group and everyone loved the food they ordered
FOOD	[ baklava ]	 The food was very reasonably priced!! Yum!Stopped here a few times for the yummy baklava
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've eaten lunch here once and it was fabulous
FOOD	[ chicken, chicken ]	I had the tan-tan chicken and it was amazing! Moist chicken and lovely flavors
FOOD	[ falafel, sandwiches ]	Herein lie the finest falafel sandwiches in the area, and that's all that's needed to justify my continuing patronage
FOOD	[ O  ]	The donuts fill the display cases with colors, and fill the air with intoxicating scents
FOOD	[ O  ]	So many different shapes and sizes, but the freshness and delicacy are consistent throughout
FOOD	[ O  ]	The "Rapid Dozen" is a good value, providing a diverse sampling of donut types to take to work, provided they make it that far
FOOD	[ cuisine, falafel ]	Still, my main inspiration behind the countless visits through the years is the Lebanese cuisine, and specifically the falafel
FOOD	[ dishes, hummus, babaganoush, kebabs, gyros, falafel ]	You will find plenty of tasty dishes, from hummus and babaganoush, to kebabs and gyros, but the incomparable falafel stands above
FOOD	[ falafel ]	There aren't, truth be told, more than a few real competitors for Madison's top falafel (Banzo is also great, then it drops off), but those found at People's are really top notch, competitive with any I've had throughout the country
FOOD	[ beat ]	The prices and the falafels simply cannot be beat, and the owners are incredibly warm and friendly people who have been crafting joy through delicious food for many moons now
FOOD	[ O  ]	There is nothing to keep me from recommending People's Bakery with the full five stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have been a customer for years
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Lunch menu is excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I stop by often and  the owners are very accomdating and friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 People's is an asset to Madison!Went for dinner the other night
FOOD	[ gyro ]	We have found our new gyro restaurant!
FOOD	[ gyro ]	Hubby & I both ordered gyro
FOOD	[ O  ]	One sammy, one plate
FOOD	[ O  ]	Man, was it good!
FOOD	[ raspberry, fritter, dessert ]	Took a raspberry fritter home for dessert, and that was great as well
FOOD	[ block ]	We will definitely be back!Living 1 block away is dangerous! This is a hidden treasure for sure
FOOD	[ O  ]	The owners are a sweet older couple who knock out some amazing food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Can't speak for the donuts but I promise you will enjoy the food
FOOD	[ falafel, fries, bucks ]	The falafel with fries is a bargain--5 bucks or so--and it will be made totally fresh for you
FOOD	[ O  ]	My go to I don't feel like cooking spot
FOOD	[ cuisine, gyros ]	What do you get when you combine Lebanese cuisine, baked goods, gyros, funky interior design and second hand talk of bed bugs?  
FOOD	[ O  ]	The perfect #yelpnewvember storm, that's what
FOOD	[ gyros ]	Over the summer, there was a spirited debate about where to find the best gyros in town after the unfortunate demise of Dmitri's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 After fellow Yelper Tawnie R boldly declared the People's Bakery as the worthy successor to Dimitri's, I knew a trip to the People's Bakery was in the cards for me
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are looking for elegant digs, this place is not for you
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's a kitschy, little greasy spoon nestled into a strip mall at the corner of East Wash and East Johnson
FOOD	[ conversation ]	 There's not a lot of seating and if someone is on the phone, you're going to be privy to their conversation
FOOD	[ O  ]	 In my case, I got a comprehensive update on a bedbug infestation of a family member that the owner's wife was describing in painstaking detail
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And while the chairs and tables are mismatched and the floor tiles are coming loose in places, the eating surfaces were all impeccably clean and the pictures on the wall gave the joint a homey feel
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And the husband and wife team that run the place have a great rapport with the regular customers getting their lunch fix
FOOD	[ O  ]	I ordered the $5
FOOD	[ gyros, fries ]	50 gyros and fries and grabbed a seat
FOOD	[ gyros ]	 About ten minutes later, a massive foil wrapped gyros was delivered to my table
FOOD	[ sheep ]	 I swear that an entire herd of sheep were sacrificed for this meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 In terms of quantity, the People's Bakery delivered big time
FOOD	[ O  ]	On the quality side, things were a little less clear cut
FOOD	[ O  ]	First the negatives:
FOOD	[ grill ]	* The next time I visit, I'm going to ask to have the pita spend a little time on the grill
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This dish deserves better than a cold, doughy pita
FOOD	[ tzatziki, lamb, meat, balance ]	* More tzatziki sauce please!!!  When you give me a metric ton of lamb meat, I need more than a tablespoon of sauce to balance out the dish
FOOD	[ tomatoes ]	* The same can be said of the tomatoes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I need more than two very thinly cut slices
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now the positives:
FOOD	[ meat ]	* The meat was served piping hot, moist and well seasoned
FOOD	[ meat, heat, crush ]	 It was clear this meat wasn't sitting under a heat lamp awaiting the lunch time crush
FOOD	[ char ]	 The only thing I would have changed is to have a little char on some of the pieces to provide more textural contrast
FOOD	[ onions ]	* The onions served with the dish were pure awesomeness
FOOD	[ onions, gyros ]	 I'll be honest, I usually pick most of the onions off my gyros because they can overpower the other ingredients with their sulfuric pungency
FOOD	[ dice, onions ]	 With a medium dice, these onions were fresh and sweet and complemented each bite
FOOD	[ fries ]	* I l-o-v-e-d the fries that accompanied the meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Salty and crunchy on the outside and hot and moist on the outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Yummmmmm
FOOD	[ Gyros ]	So, does the People's Bakery unseat Trader Gus as my King of Madison Gyros
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I say it's too close to call right now
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What I do know is that I plan to return to the People's Bakery to conduct more extensive research
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And if you find yourself on the east side with an empty stomach and a light wallet, People's Bakery is an option worth considering
FOOD	[ bear ]	In addition to sweet treats like donuts and bear claws, they also have lunch and dinner options for cheap
FOOD	[ Falafel, gyro, sandwich ]	Falafel is not the best in town, but try the gyro, which comes as a sandwich or entree sized plate
FOOD	[ hummus, kebobs ]	They have other standard Mediterranean options such as hummus and kebobs
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seating is limited and would not be good for large groups
FOOD	[ O  ]	Definitely more of a take-out place
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would definitely go back to explore their menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	Solid donut shop
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Nice parking lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Great selection of donuts available, even at 11:30am on a Sunday (most other places are sold out)
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Totally reasonable prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Donuts are good; I'd say on par with most places, but not quite as good as Greenbush
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Presentation/cabinet could use some work - very narrow space and it's nearly impossible to see what's availableSome secrets are best kept secret
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However I don't want my new donuts find going out of business anytime soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I stumbled across this little gem while trying to find some real donuts for my wife to take to her at work
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I found the People's Bakery
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The donuts selection was wonderful
FOOD	[ scones ]	 The wall mentioned some other baked goods as you walk in like scones, but those are no longer available
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The donuts were fantastic
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So good that I had to go back today and they are still fantastic and the shelves were socked full at 9:30am with plenty of choices and the prices are great
FOOD	[ O  ]	To be honest i had tunnel vision on the donuts but I believe they have some other things to offer for lunch and dinner
FOOD	[ baklava ]	Their food and pastries are good, but most importantly they had the best baklava I've ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am pretty disappointed with this place
FOOD	[ gyro ]	 After it being described as the best gyro in town, I was let down
FOOD	[ gyro ]	The gyro is good and it is only $4
FOOD	[ O  ]	50
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, best in town? Eh
FOOD	[ tomatoes ]	They forgot my tomatoes
FOOD	[ O  ]	There is nothing really terrible about this place, but it was just "ok
FOOD	[ pizza ]	"Great stuffed pizza
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great price for so much
FOOD	[ sandwiches, pizza ]	Pretty good sandwiches, and thin crust pizza
FOOD	[ pizza, butter ]	Dont care for their Chicago deep dish,stuffed,or pan style pizza,because it tastes like they use margerine in the crust instead of half margerine, half butter, which is the way I like the Chicago deep dish crust to be made
FOOD	[ italian beef sandwich, sausage, sandwich ]	Try the Valentino, on thin crust,and it will spin your cap for sure,and they have a good italian beef sandwich,and sausage sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall,its a bit pricey,but they do have some very good choices
FOOD	[ O  ]	They also charge 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	50 for a delivery fee!I must say perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	I travel for work and it was great to check into my room, find Rosati's on Yelp and have them here within 30 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was much more than I anticipated
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A MUST try
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very well seasoned and the service was great from the phone call to the delivery
FOOD	[ Spinach, Tomato, Garlic bread, pizza ]	5 stars all around!  The Spinach and Tomato Garlic bread was delicious!I love their thin crust pizza but I always feel a little ripped off which keeps me from ordering from them often
FOOD	[ pizza, bucks ]	 They charge a steep delivery fee which if not taken form the tip makes a pizza almost 28 bucks
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Other places around here have bullshit delivery fees (along with bitchy statements about not taking the fee out of your tip, as if the person buying the food is responsible for the shitty wage the store pays or the tacked on fee that apparently does not actually support delivery) but they are usually less
FOOD	[ O  ]	I kind of agree with Michael R
FOOD	[ O  ]	below about the overall quality of the Food Fight restaurants
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But I do have to point out that Food Fight is based in Madison, and operates restaurants only here, so it is "local
FOOD	[ O  ]	"  As for "independent," well, nine restaurants doesn't make a very big chain
FOOD	[ Bagels ]	 Ian's has three locations and has overlapping ownership with Gotham Bagels, which has two more; is that not an "independent" restaurant?
FOOD	[ O  ]	None of which is to say you should eat at these restaurants
FOOD	[ Taco, Mexican ]	 Tex Tubb's Taco Palace is OK, but there's much better, much cheaper Mexican all over Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Hubbard Avenue Diner serves a pretty good breakfast but disappointing lunch and dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Bluephies is good for kids but I'd never go there with grownups only
FOOD	[ Fresco, Cafe ]	 And Fresco actually held up pretty well against its peers the one time I ate there -- way ahead of Cafe Continental and a little behind Magnus
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurants that Food Fight offers are all subpar, with one exception of Johnny Delmonicos
FOOD	[ O  ]	Aside from the Johnny D's the others all serve incredibly bad food
FOOD	[ Dorado, glass ]	I tried El Dorado's once and it was terrible, on top of things they charge so much for a margerita served in a tiny glass its ridiculous
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have been a food fight customer and visit all of there restaurants on a regular basis
FOOD	[ blue plate ]	My favorite is Monty's blue plate
FOOD	[ loaf ]	The meatless loaf of the gods is my favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	Have tried other things and have always been happy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Every year they sell gift certificates and for every one hundred dollars they give you a twenty five dollar certificate
FOOD	[ beat ]	Can't beat that
FOOD	[ O  ]	I load up a gift card with five hundred and eat all year
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would never agree with the people that have bashed their places
FOOD	[ O  ]	Try it you will like it
FOOD	[ pizza ]	This has been my favorite location to get pizza in Madison since I was a child
FOOD	[ pizza ]	It used to be such a treat to get those pizza twins and argue over the toppings with my sister and I always remember being thankful when i had it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not much has changed since, other than the fact that I can afford it eat it when I want now! I probably order from there 5 to 7 times a month on average and I can't forget their slices which they have available from (11 to 2)
FOOD	[ inferno, chicken ]	I'm a fan of the inferno wings, hell all of the chicken there is above satisfactory in my estimation
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	The Zesty Djion BBQ sauce is one of a kind and I've never seen it replicated in any other restaurant
FOOD	[ chicken ]	It's perfect for the crust  and chicken alike
FOOD	[ cheese ]	I'll admit at times it's greasier than I like but overall it's one of my favorite pizzas in the city from the cheese to the sauce
FOOD	[ pizza ]	Just can't get decent pizza in Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	sorry
FOOD	[ pizza ]	but someone needs to head down to Chicago and learn how to make a pizza
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place piles sauce and toppings on a crust that can't support it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 you end up with a slide off mess
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Flimsy crap
FOOD	[ Grease ]	Grease running down my hand
FOOD	[ O  ]	That's a first
FOOD	[ O  ]	Maybe that's appealing to some people, but definitely not me
FOOD	[ Pizza ]	Sorry, Pizza Pit staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	[Cue the Tim & Eric "Ya blew it!" 
FOOD	[ O  ]	gif
FOOD	[ pizza ]	]The pizza here is OK, the staff here is friendly, and they have good daily deals
FOOD	[ buffet, buffet ]	The lunch buffet from 11:30 to 3pm is crazy delicious!  Weekend buffet is 10 dollars a person
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Try a little bit of this and that, take what you want, leave what you don't
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great food, good service
FOOD	[ buffet, belly ]	 I recently went to their Odana Rd location on the West side for dinner and the food was still very, very good, but the price was nuts!  So stick with the lunch buffet and you will have happy belly and happy wallet
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of a select few good places to eat on the far East side of town
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I mean come on, between a bunch of chain restaurants flanking the mall and Maharaja, there's no comparison
FOOD	[ buffet ]	 Love lunch buffet, and you can in fact grab a solid dinner as well
FOOD	[ ginger, eggplant, mango, chicken, curry ]	 Perfect dinner for two: samosas, ginger naan, bainghan bartha (mashed grilled eggplant mmm), and mango chicken curry
FOOD	[ bass, hop ]	 The service is very courteous for dinner, they drop your napkin in your lap and you get a hot steaming towel after your meal!  Extra points for the extremely bass-heavy hip hop gospel music coming through the wall from Now Faith Ministries next door
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They have one helluva sound system
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If that's not your sort of thing, then avoid typical church hours
FOOD	[ buffet ]	;)Excellent lunch buffet, quick service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love this place
FOOD	[ buffet ]	Their lunch buffet is great
FOOD	[ O  ]	So is their dinner menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	My partner and I went there for dinner on New Years Eve and for Valentines Day, we had so much fun
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is a relaxed atmosphere and they have great food
FOOD	[ Masala ]	I recommend the Tikki Masala
FOOD	[ buffets, dishes ]	Tired of "phone-it-in" lunch buffets, with the same 6 dishes day after day?  Then Maharaja might get you out of your funk
FOOD	[ buffet ]	 I've been to their lunch buffet about 5 times, and EVERY time there is a new dish or two that I've never seen before
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great price on the lunch
FOOD	[ dessert ]	 Wonderful dessert selection
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 Good variety between meaty and veggie dishes
FOOD	[ goat, curry ]	 Love the goat curry
FOOD	[ Indian food ]	 If you like Indian food at all, you can't go wrong with a lunch at Maharaja
FOOD	[ O  ]	(And for facebookers
FOOD	[ O  ]	No, I did NOT eat 4 times tonight
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Just catching up on some restaurants that deserve a good review
FOOD	[ buffet ]	)The buffet is ok, but I came back for dinner and the specific items are very good
FOOD	[ chickpea, curry ]	I had a vegetable korma and a chickpea curry
FOOD	[ O  ]	Samosas were super
FOOD	[ Chutney ]	Chutney could have been a bit spicyer, but hotness on the food at medium was quite good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Go here for dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum
FOOD	[ nan, rice ]	They had as special, 2 entrees, nan, rice and popadom for $20
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have drove past this place a thousand times, and never realized it was even here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I didn't discover my deep and passionate love of Nepalese food until moving up to the Twin Cities, but over break my dearest mother suggested we go to the Maharaja on the east side
FOOD	[ O  ]	"On the east side?" I scoffed, foolishly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 "There is nothing but chain food and malls on the east side!"  I know this statement fairly well, as we grew up 20 minutes east of the east side of Madison, making a trip downtown quite a hike
FOOD	[ O  ]	But she assured me that it was in fact  on the east side
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And not on the east side like
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ella's Deli is on the east side
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This thing is on the East Side as in East Towne Mall is on the East Side
FOOD	[ O  ]	So, reluctantly, I went in
FOOD	[ O  ]	 AND WAS GREETED WITH AWESOME
FOOD	[ buffet ]	 This buffet was amazing
FOOD	[ coconut, soup, chicken, dishes, dishes ]	 They had a coconut soup which was great, all of the chicken dishes were great, they had a wide variety of veg dishes
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was so stunned and amazed
FOOD	[ strawberry, lassi ]	 Even though I didn't partake, they served strawberry lassi
FOOD	[ mango, ice cream ]	mmm!  Finished off with some mango ice cream, I couldn't have been more impressed
FOOD	[ O  ]	Whenever I visit home, I always drag my family along to Maharaja
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Delicious, and a good price
FOOD	[ cream ]	 All the staff are very friendly too!!This is it - the cream of the crop
FOOD	[ Indian, buffets ]	I've lived in the Madison area for the past two years, have visited many of the local Indian buffets, and have found none that equal the Maharaja standard
FOOD	[ Buffet, dishes, chicken, tikka, masala ]	  Buffet dishes change on a daily basis, but you can always count on their show-stopping chicken tikka masala to be in the mix
FOOD	[ meat, curries, tandoori, chicken, dishes, appetizers ]	 In addition to the standard meat curries and tandoori chicken, they always offer multiple vegetarian dishes and an array of appetizers
FOOD	[ coconut, soup, kofta, baingan, chicken, tikka, masala, mango, ice cream ]	Recommendations:  coconut soup, vegetable korma, malai kofta, baingan bhartha, chicken tikka masala, mango ice cream
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff is wonderful and always keeps plates of naan a plenty :)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Maharaja is by far one of Madison's best restaurants
FOOD	[ beat, buffet ]	 And, you can't beat their lunch buffet deal (under $10)
FOOD	[ O  ]	  But diners beware, it is incredibly easy to overeat at this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	forcing one into an almost immediate food coma upon settling the check
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place had its awards placed up near the entrance, so they can say they're awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	But, these awards are outdated
FOOD	[ O  ]	Remember one that was dated back in 2008
FOOD	[ O  ]	No 2010 yet
FOOD	[ O  ]	ha
FOOD	[ Tandoori, chicken, Lamb, curry ]	Had the Tandoori chicken and the Lamb curry
FOOD	[ lamb, curry, lamb ]	The lamb curry was awesome, although not enough lamb chunks
FOOD	[ tandoori ]	 The tandoori was excellent and spicy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Had a side order of naan too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious! But expect to pay a good amount
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its quite good and the awards don't lie
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff here make the experience
FOOD	[ buffets ]	Since I am not a fan of buffets, I can only tell you about the meals here
FOOD	[ O  ]	DELICIOUS
FOOD	[ meat, meat ]	I don't eat meat, my boyfriend almost only eats meat, we both found things we loved
FOOD	[ O  ]	it was the best! We liked to eat here once a week since it was so amazing
FOOD	[ buffets, buffet ]	I'm not usually a fan of buffets, but Maharajah's lunch buffet was quite enjoyable
FOOD	[ dishes, sauces ]	I tried small amounts of a variety of dishes and sauces and all were tasty
FOOD	[ eggplant, goat, curry ]	Their stuffed eggplant special and goat curry were super
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food seemed to be recently made as it was not dried out or overcooked
FOOD	[ indian, indian ]	Sorry I am indian and as a indian this place blows 
FOOD	[ samosa ]	Their aloo parathas are a cop out the just use samosa filling for the stuffing 
FOOD	[ pickles, curry, vegetables ]	 The spicy pickles are from a can, also their vegetable curry is made with frozen vegetables not fresh 
FOOD	[ beef ]	Also I know its not a authentic place when the serve beef
FOOD	[ beef, goat, lamb, chicken, beef ]	 No authentic place will ever serve beef, they will serve goat, lamb, chicken and every animal except beef
FOOD	[ O  ]	what else, oh yea two of the servers started chewing each other out in the back of the room where EVERYONE could here
FOOD	[ india ]	Also they should invest in making "chaat" food - street food of india 
FOOD	[ garlic ]	they had none of that one the menu!  I will give it 1 star because the garlic naan was good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also our waiter was really nice it was some guy who moved here from SD
FOOD	[ indian food, Indian food ]	Save your indian food craving and head down to ChicagoI am not sure what I like for Indian food but this was damn good
FOOD	[ buffet, diet ]	Pretty good lunch buffet, theres alot of vegetarian choices if you stick to a certain kind of diet like myself
FOOD	[ meat ]	 I eat only Halal meat
FOOD	[ meat, buffet ]	 I haven't asked if any of the meat on buffet was halal only because I don't want to make a fuss
FOOD	[ meat ]	 I will however call ahead and see if they are serving any Halal meat before I decide to dine for dinner
FOOD	[ Chicken, Goat, goat ]	 Sometimes they have Chicken and Goat but sometimes only goat
FOOD	[ O  ]	As far as authenticity goes, I can't personally say because I am not south asian
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That being said, a friend of mine who is complains alot that there is no authentic south asian restaurants in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This how ever does not take away from the tastiness that I have experienced at Maharaja
FOOD	[ dishes ]	They have satisfying dishes that come in satisfying portions
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you dare to go to the spicy side of the spectrum they are constantly filling your water, which is awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You don't want to be left without water when the burn becomes too much
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You can ask for not so spicy though ;)
FOOD	[ Cheese ]	The only not so great thing I've ever had here was the Cheese pakora, they kind of seemed like they were pre made (as in frozen) and not fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	That was the only thing, ever, in all the times I've been to Maharaja
FOOD	[ dishes ]	Both east and west locations have awesome service and tasty main dishes
FOOD	[ O  ]	You'll be treated like royalty at the Maharaja
FOOD	[ O  ]	I first came upon this place by chance
FOOD	[ Indian ]	I was in town for work and noticed that there was an Indian restaurant nearby
FOOD	[ O  ]	After reading the great reviews on Yelp, I knew I had to try it for myself
FOOD	[ Chicken, TIkka, Masala, bread, chai ]	I ordered the Chicken TIkka Masala along with Naan bread and a cup of chai
FOOD	[ Indian ]	I ordered the food to be Indian hot
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waiter replied, "I like your confidence!" It was very tasty and hot just as I like it
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant was well kept, the staff treat the guests as royalty so the service is wonderful, and the prices are decent for what you're getting
FOOD	[ Indian, Indian ]	Don't forget to stop by the Indian grocery that is located next door to this location! It has a large selection of items so that you can make your own Indian dinner at home
FOOD	[ O  ]	Will I be back the next time I'm in town?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Absolutely
FOOD	[ chicken, tikka, masala, garlic, chai, Indian food ]	We did takeout and we ended up with large portions of excellent chicken tikka masala, garlic naan and veggie pakora and they gave us free chai for the road!I have a new found love for Indian food and when I found myself in Madison I had to check this place out
FOOD	[ appetizer ]	It was most excellently delicious! The staff was very nice and the price for 3 people including 4 drinks and an appetizer was about $75
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you ever find yourself on the East side of Madison, you should really check this place out
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food here is good
FOOD	[ Indian food, Indian food ]	My husband and I are new to Indian food, so I can't speak to its authenticity or how good it is in comparison to other Indian food, but overall we really liked the food here
FOOD	[ chicken, tikka, masala, buffet ]	The chicken tikka masala was particularly delicious, though there were lots of very good options at the buffet
FOOD	[ O  ]	The naan was also good (and needed to cool the mouth every so often)
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was okay! Nothing good or bad to say there
FOOD	[ O  ]	The inside was really not all that awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	That was the major part that brought down the experience for us; it looked like it could do with a face-lift
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decor was ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing special but there were some odd mylar stars and hot air balloons hanging from the ceiling
FOOD	[ O  ]	Came in for dinner and there are two other tables at 8:00 on a Thursday night
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I wonder if people go to bed early around this neighborhood or if this place just isn't that popular
FOOD	[ Coconut, soup ]	Coconut soup was weird 
FOOD	[ coconut milk, coconut ]	 A mix of hot coconut milk that's been watered down and then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a bag
FOOD	[ coconut, soup ]	 This was definitely not fresh coconut in any way and I found this soup to be disapointing
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ Lamb, Saag, lamb ]	Lamb Saag was about as much lamb as you might expect for a dish costing 12
FOOD	[ O  ]	95
FOOD	[ appetite, lamb ]	It's uniform liquidey sludge was a little too reminiscent of diarrhea for me and I lost a little of my appetite, though the lamb was tender and cooked well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The overall dish was very very salty with no special taste
FOOD	[ Indian, lamb ]	 Just a little spicy, a little Indian, and a little lamb
FOOD	[ curry paste, cook, flavor, salt ]	 They are probably using curry paste from a jar, or there is just not a very imaginative cook in the kitchen because the whole dish was lacking in flavor (besides salt)
FOOD	[ cardamom, cardamom ]	 A whole cardamom pod was left hidden in the diarrhea sludge, which led to an unpleasant burst of cardamom in one bite
FOOD	[ Rice ]	Rice had clearly been sitting around for awhile and was very dry throughout with crunchy bits and very chewy bits
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I just don't see how this is acceptable to serve someone in a restaurant
FOOD	[ Rice ]	 Rice is one of the cheapest ingredients out there
FOOD	[ rice ]	 If the rice has been sitting for too long, throw it out and make more
FOOD	[ saag, rice, lamb, Saag, rice, rice, Saag ]	I tried the saag with the rice and the oily mess of lamb Saag rehydrated the rice somewhat, and the rice's absorption of the Saag took away some of its saltiness
FOOD	[ sauces ]	Three sauces or chutneys that came with the papadom were not very good at all
FOOD	[ glass ]	Had to ask to have my water glass filled every single time I finished it
FOOD	[ curry, dishes ]	(this is a major pet peeve)Excellent, excellent! Very impressed with their assorted curry dishes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Highly recommend
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't expect fancy atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff moves at their own pace but that doesn't matter when the food is soooo good
FOOD	[ buffet, Chicken, Tikka, buffet ]	We went for the buffet on a Sunday morning, and are so glad we decided to give it a try!  My husband's favorite is Chicken Tikka Massala - which they had on the buffet
FOOD	[ Indian food ]	 I'm pretty new to Indian food, but there were so many options and so many things I liked!  
FOOD	[ glasses ]	The service was amazing!  Our water glasses were constantly full, which is good considering some of the food is really spicy!  We're not from that area, but if we were in the neighborhood, I would consider going there again!What a great find! As several others have pointed out, the decor is nothing to write home about - nor even to dwell on it in a Yelp review, but It has always been my contention that if you offer great food at a fair price and are not offering a dining experience, then restaurant cleanliness and an attentive wait staff is a better investment than wood carvings and mood lighting
FOOD	[ buffet, tandoori, chicken ]	We came for lunch and it turned out they had a fantastic buffet! Everything from tandoori chicken to palak aloo
FOOD	[ O  ]	Every dish was so flavorful and authentic
FOOD	[ O  ]	Having spent two years overseas where I associated with several Indians, I know they would have been suitably impressed
FOOD	[ glasses ]	The waiter brought naan to the table and was there when our water glasses emptied
FOOD	[ O  ]	He didn't hover but he was attentive
FOOD	[ buffet ]	My lunch partner and I got a kick out of the sign that politely let buffet eaters know we were welcome to the food but would be charged for waste
FOOD	[ buffets ]	It should go without saying, but I have been to several all-you-can-eat buffets and have witnessed first hand the amount of leftover food that has to be thrown away because people take too much
FOOD	[ O  ]	Personally I think part of the blame should be placed on the cooks/managers for not putting out a better product, but certainly the customer is largely to blame
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hence, a sign that clearly articulates the Maharaja's expectation of its customers is a good thing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Let's face it, if the food was bad, the customer would be screaming
FOOD	[ Indian food ]	Bottom line, Eat here if you love Indian food
FOOD	[ O  ]	At tha advice of the reviews on yelp, my family decided to try out this restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Excellent food at decent prices
FOOD	[ Indian food ]	 If you like Indian food, I would highly recommend that you eat here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was in town on business and had a free night so I decided to give Maharaja a try
FOOD	[ Mulligatawny Soup, Garlic, Tandoori, Chicken ]	I had the Mulligatawny Soup, Garlic Naan, and the Tandoori Chicken
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food was really good (awesome Naan!) and the portions were quite large
FOOD	[ chicken ]	 The chicken was out-of-this-world and I could not finish it all
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only negative was the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	I dined on a Tuesday evening at 6:30ish
FOOD	[ O  ]	It took a long time for my waiter to take my order
FOOD	[ O  ]	Though the place seemed relatively full
FOOD	[ O  ]	There were only two waitstaff
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When i arrived, there seemed to be several employees outside smoking
FOOD	[ Indian ]	Also, My waiter was not of Indian descent, which is perfectly fine, but he did not speak English, thus my questions about the menu and what he recommended went unanswered
FOOD	[ O  ]	It also took a long time for my food to arrive
FOOD	[ O  ]	From the time I sat down to the time my food arrived was almost an hour
FOOD	[ O  ]	All-in-all, I would go back again because the food was very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would have given 4 stars, save for the awful customer service
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went here at the suggestion of several people who told me how great the food was
FOOD	[ Indian, cuisine ]	I admit my experience with Indian cuisine is limited, but for the most part pleasant, so I thought it was worth a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was outstanding! I ordered Aloo Ghobi
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really flavorful and spicy
FOOD	[ heat ]	I don't know if this is commonplace everywhere, but since I moved up from Texas it's been really difficult to order a dish and be satisfied with the level of heat
FOOD	[ O  ]	Here they asked if I preferred mild or hot, when I said hot, they asked how hot, I said very and they definitely delivered
FOOD	[ tandoori, chicken ]	My husband ordered the tandoori chicken which is a very generaously sized portion
FOOD	[ griddle, lemon ]	It comes out on what looks like a small griddle, steaming, with peppers and lemon slices
FOOD	[ bowl, rice, bread ]	They also brought out a big bowl of white rice along with some Naan bread that we asked for
FOOD	[ O  ]	All in all, it was a very satisfying experience and we will definitely be going back!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service can be a little slow, but the staff are very attentive and helpful
FOOD	[ glass ]	They're also really good at refilling drinks, I know it seemed like our server kept refilling my glass every time I took a sip
FOOD	[ Indian meal, Indian ]	I can't say enough good things about this place!  My husband, son and I go there at least once a month and it is always delicious and they take such good care of you!  Some restaurants look at you when you walk in with a little one and grimace they are always joking with our son and making him, and us, feel very comfortable!  The food is SOOO good - not a bad thing on the menu!  If you're looking for a great Indian meal in a great atmosphere with fantastic staff this is the place!Our family went to celebrate a birthday with an Indian dinner - there were 6 of us in our happy group
FOOD	[ buffets ]	 We have been going to the Maharaja for years, to enjoy the lunch buffets, Valentines Day, birthdays etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Tonight the food was good, but the service was an issue
FOOD	[ O  ]	To start, we could see that the staff had changed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service took a long time, even though there were only 5 tables with customers and six wait staff
FOOD	[ wine ]	 The server did not understand English well enough to properly place the order, so there was extra wine for one person
FOOD	[ glassware, flatware ]	 Also, the glassware and flatware were spotted, with some that needed to be sent back
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service had really changed for the worse
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The server would clear one dirty plate, then wander off, return five minutes later to get another and so on
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The Manager or owner really needs to train the staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They were all working, but seemed unclear as to who was responsible for what duties
FOOD	[ ice cream, dessert, ice cream ]	We also ordered ice cream and a special birthday dessert, while very tasty - the service was vey slow, at least 10 minutes from the time the ice cream was ordered to served
FOOD	[ O  ]	What really put us over the top was when they refused to accept their own $50 Gift Certificate that they sold to me in June towards the $160 bill (not including tip)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It had only been approximately 6 weeks
FOOD	[ O  ]	Apparently, this location has been sold
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The old owners still own the location on Odana Rd (same name), but not this one
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Therefore, they would not accept their own gift certificate and told us, we could use it at Odana Rd
FOOD	[ O  ]	Interestingly, they still kept the Best of Madison sign on the door for the old ownership,  they will need to take this down
FOOD	[ O  ]	   Again, we were surprised at the business decision about their own gift certificate
FOOD	[ Indian ]	Authentic Indian in Madison, Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Score!The neighborhood felt a little sketchy, and as a solo diner, my service wasn't very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food was OK though
FOOD	[ buffet, buffet ]	My husband and I came today with a group of 14 people for their Sunday lunch buffet and I have to say, for the price, excellent service and quality of food, I really recommend this place!  I called ahead and they allowed our group to have a semi-private room away from the restaurant but close to the buffet
FOOD	[ buffet, dishes, chicken, tikka, masala, samosa, dishes ]	 The buffet had all the dishes you would hope for and some unexpected ones as well!  I really enjoyed the chicken tikka, chana masala, samosa and more common dishes
FOOD	[ goat, fish ]	but they also had a goat dish, fish, several biryanis, really nice chutneys, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	My only complaint  about this place was that the naan wasn't in a basket with a napkin to keep it warm
FOOD	[ O  ]	it was just plopped on a plate and got cold quickly
FOOD	[ dessert, buffet, mango, ice cream ]	 The naan was great and deserves to be kept warm!  The dessert section of the buffet had a ton of variety but the mango ice cream was superb
FOOD	[ mango, ice cream ]	 Apparently, when you order a meal during the week (even take away!), everyone gets a mango ice cream as well
FOOD	[ mango, ice cream, Fish ]	 The food was excellent but the mango ice cream will bring me back!Friday = Great Fish Fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All you can eat ocean perch
FOOD	[ slaw, tartar sauce, lemon ]	 Big bowls of slaw, tartar sauce, and lemon chunks on the table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Dignified and refined, I wouldn't eat perch anywhere else in Madison
FOOD	[ fish ]	Old-timey fern bar with a fish fry like you used to enjoy with Grandma
FOOD	[ crinkle-cut, fries, meat, fish, meat ]	 Like the other reviewers, I order the ocean perch which comes family style with crinkle-cut fries!    This place is so good I make the destination of my twice-yearly meat craving!  (That's right - I consider fish meat
FOOD	[ Gram ]	)  Don't sweat the wait you are likely to encounter (even if you and Gram get there at 4:30)
FOOD	[ Bloody Mary, age ]	 The bartenders make a delightful spicy Bloody Mary, which helps add to the overall feeling that have I reached retirement age
FOOD	[ O  ]	Here's a place with a lot of potential, the bar area is dark and old boys club in feel, with a large oval bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The drinks were "healthy" and reasonably priced
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Its definately an older supperclubby feel, but in a warm, comfortable, cardigan sweater on a cold winter day sort of way
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The big downfall here was the food
FOOD	[ filet, shrimp, potato ]	 I had heard good things and maybe I just was there on an off day, but my meal was a filet with breaded shrimp and stuffed potato and none of it lived up to expectations
FOOD	[ steak, shrimp, bread, shrimp, potato, cake ]	 The steak was so raw I could only eat the edges, the breaded shrimp were more bread than shrimp and the potato reminded me of a christmas bunt cake and not in a good way
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Ill give them another chance because we were with a big group and even the best restaurants have off days, but at our table we all had similar thoughts on the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	   And to be fair I didnt ask for any adjustments, the management seemed very accomodating to guests in the bar and dining areas
FOOD	[ fish, fries ]	As a Wisconsin native, Friday fish fries have always been a big part of my life
FOOD	[ fish, fries ]	When living in Madison years ago, we used to hit all the great fish fries on the lakes around town
FOOD	[ O  ]	And while spending 10 years in Hayward, we used to live for Fridays at Lost Land Lake Lodge and later The Waterfront
FOOD	[ O  ]	Living in Utah for over 20 years, my opportunities are few and far between
FOOD	[ O  ]	So I was excited to have a free Friday in Madison to try the very best
FOOD	[ O  ]	Reading online reviews, going off my past knowledge and talking to friends, I made the tough call between the Avenue Bar (one of my favorite lunch spots) and the Esquire Club
FOOD	[ O  ]	We chose the Esquire
FOOD	[ O  ]	I hadn't been in the club in probably 30-35 years
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, it was a good experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	But it wasn't close to the level to which I'm accustomed to in Hayward on our three or four trips out there a year
FOOD	[ choice ]	We had a great time and I highly recommend it, but we would make another choice next time
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bar at Kavanaugh's Esquire Club is great - a full horseshoe with plenty of seating
FOOD	[ O  ]	We arrived around 5:30 p
FOOD	[ Lent ]	on a Friday in Lent
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was packed already, as was every spot in the parking lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	We put our name in and were told it would be 20 minutes for our party of two
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were seated in just ten
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of the challenges with the Esquire is it just doesn't have a lot of natural atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	The main room with the bar is fabulous
FOOD	[ O  ]	But the other dining rooms are really plain with not a single thing on the wall
FOOD	[ O  ]	The table settings are nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	And outside, it's a totally blah building
FOOD	[ cigarette ]	Out the back door to the parking lot was an attractive collection of a few hundred cigarette butts sitting on the sidewalk and snowbank
FOOD	[ rye bread, cole, slaw ]	The tables are pre-set with great, fresh rye bread and fabulous cole slaw
FOOD	[ O  ]	And we had quick attention from our waitress
FOOD	[ menus, menus ]	The host gave us menus - actually three stapled, photocopied sheets - pretty tacky (I noticed others did get regular menus)
FOOD	[ fish ]	It's a full supper club menu with multiple choices for fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	We opted for the $9
FOOD	[ O  ]	95 all-you-can-eat ocean perch
FOOD	[ O  ]	What was notable to me as that the current Web page for Esquire lists the price at $8
FOOD	[ O  ]	95
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not good
FOOD	[ Cod ]	Cod was also available at a slightly higher price
FOOD	[ bread, slaw ]	The bread and slaw kept us entertained and both were world class
FOOD	[ fish, fries ]	A heaping plate of fish and crinkle fries arrived in good time (beating the Coke our grandson ordered 15 minutes earlier)
FOOD	[ lemons ]	We had to ask for lemons
FOOD	[ fish ]	The fish was very good - I love perch
FOOD	[ O  ]	But as good as it was, it simply wasn't at the presentation and taste level of what we traditionally get at The Waterfront in Hayward, for example
FOOD	[ cornbread, beer, fish ]	It was a simple cornbread-type breading that was good, but somewhat uninteresting - not the flamboyant texture of the beer battered fish we have grown to expect
FOOD	[ fish, fries, chocolate, mousse ]	Nonetheless, we polished off the fish, got a few more fries and a chocolate mousse desert
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bill for two with a few beers and desert was just under $40
FOOD	[ O  ]	Later that night, we also hit the Beachhouse in McFarland, another popular local spot
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife had dinner there with a friend
FOOD	[ fish ]	This is an awesome place with a ton of atmosphere and great fish
FOOD	[ O  ]	Esquire Club Summary (five point scale)
FOOD	[ cigarette ]	Exterior: 2 - Pretty plain building; cigarette butts not pretty
FOOD	[ O  ]	Interior atmosphere: 3 - Main bar room is great
FOOD	[ fish, batter ]	Food: 4 - Good was great, not overally thrilled with fish batter
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service: 3 - Generally good, but shouldn't have to wait for main course to get a Coke
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value: 5 - $9
FOOD	[ fish, fish, Fish ]	95 for an all-you-can-eat fish fry at this level is outstandingDetermined to find the best darned fish fry in Madison, our "Friday Night Fish Fry Fanatics" decided to try the Esquire Club on Sherman
FOOD	[ O  ]	We grabbed a seat at the large, oval, darkwooded bar, and ordered a couple of Spotted Cows
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were told it would be about 20 minutes to seat our small group, and that was just fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bar was cozy, the beers fresh, and the service attentive, friendly, and helpful
FOOD	[ O  ]	Soon enough, our name was called and we were seated in one of the "auxillary" dining areas
FOOD	[ all good ]	Clearly an add-on, not a single decoration, but definitely welcomed; the place was packed and we were seated quickly, so it's all good by me
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our waitress took our orders and brought us a round of Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours
FOOD	[ rye bread, rye ]	We gnoshed on the deliciously fresh rye bread, which was unlike any other rye I've had
FOOD	[ rye, flavor ]	It featured a very mild rye flavor and a very light texture
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was delicious
FOOD	[ Fish, cod, fries ]	Fish arrived within minutes: fried ocean perch and battered cod, one order of fries, and two orders of cheesy hashbrowns (cost an extra $2 per)
FOOD	[ grease, fish, fish ]	The fried ocean perch is all you can eat, and it's fresh, lightly breaded, flavorful, grease-free, and easily some of the best fish I've had at a fish fry
FOOD	[ O  ]	I scarfed down three heaping plates, and I do mean "heaping
FOOD	[ O  ]	" They're not skimpy with the refills
FOOD	[ cod ]	Battered cod was equally good, but it wasn't all you can eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	Three large, beautifully brown, battered and flaky filets are what you get
FOOD	[ Fries ]	Fries were outstanding as well; crinkle cut, fresh, hot, crispy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yum
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hashbrowns were cooked perfectly but the slab of Velveeta that was slapped on top to make them "cheesy" was disappointing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was the best yet
FOOD	[ O  ]	No complaints
FOOD	[ fish ]	Three fish dinners with coffees and a couple of rounds of drinks was $70 + tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	A bit pricey by my book
FOOD	[ O  ]	Esquire Club = WIN
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food= 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	75 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Old Fashioneds= 3
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service = 5 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value = 3 stars
FOOD	[ potato, pancake ]	Misc = 4 stars (speedy seating and service; lost points for bland interior and no potato pancake option)At first, I loved the Esquire Club for how old-fashioned its style and clientele were
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is the closest I've had to a Wisconsin supper club, and in the winter, it seems especially comfy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But, the food -- outside of a couple items -- is really substandard
FOOD	[ cod ]	 Never, ever, ever, get a "broiled" icelandic cod, it comes charred to a crisp
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The lake perch is fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But, that's about it, really
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Simple presentation and simple food, but it never elevates to the level of being phenomenal
FOOD	[ Fish ]	My semi-local friend thought nothing would be more authentically Wisconsin than a Friday Night Fish Fry
FOOD	[ corned beef ]	After overdosing on spam & corned beef hash for the past week, I was down for something local so I gladly obliged
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wood-paneling and dim lighting make the main bar warm & inviting
FOOD	[ O  ]	Packed with locals, which is always a good sign
FOOD	[ brandy ]	Strong brandy old-fashioned
FOOD	[ O  ]	Only downer was the downstairs dining area--kinda felt like a church bingo hall
FOOD	[ bread, coleslaw ]	Soft, tender & delicious bread, oddly sweet coleslaw
FOOD	[ Fried cheese, curds ]	Fried cheese curds were good--moderately breaded, not greasy, smooth texture but not squeaky
FOOD	[ O  ]	Family style ocean perch was satisfying but not memorable
FOOD	[ O  ]	Un(der)seasoned but not greasy, breading a little thicker than desired
FOOD	[ Crinkle-cut, fries, salt ]	Crinkle-cut fries were great but also needed salt
FOOD	[ Tartar sauce, mayo ]	Tartar sauce was a little too heavy on the mayo
FOOD	[ dessert ]	Still ate a ton and didn't have room for dessert
FOOD	[ frying ]	Overall, excellent deep frying skills but might need a refresher course in seasoning
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great atmosphere; easy to see why they have such a strong following
FOOD	[ Fish ]	Got take out here tonight and I love myself some Wisconsin Fish Fry
FOOD	[ Cod, potatoes ]	We ordered the Lake Perch and The Cod, with baked potatoes
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The Lake Perch was light and small but with many pieces-delish-more than enough
FOOD	[ cod ]	I didn't eat the cod but my relative said it was good but not as good as my perch
FOOD	[ potatoes ]	The bake potatoes were excellent, large, cooked perfectly and yummy
FOOD	[ Rye Bread ]	The Rye Bread is a nice touch and it was great
FOOD	[ Slaw, sour cream ]	Slaw, tart sauce and sour cream were all added in a nice box
FOOD	[ O  ]	I ordered and they were available in 10 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	The woman on the phone was great and the woman that rang me out was great and friendly, considering that she was dealing with an overflow house
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will be back soon
FOOD	[ ass ]	I read the new ass't governor gave a speech there invoking God
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Please, spare me, now I will pass
FOOD	[ O  ]	Please save that shit for church
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The rest of us will pass on this crap
FOOD	[ Fish, Fish ]	I went there a few months ago for Fish Fry after reading a rating that this place was a great place for Fish Fry's
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've had dinner here before and it was very good, so I thought oh why not, I'll give it a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	Big mistake! They usually get pretty busy (usually a good sign), but that night we didn't have to wait long for a table
FOOD	[ Cod ]	I ordered the Icelandic Cod and It was terrible
FOOD	[ fish, cod, cod ]	As this was a few months ago, my brain is clouded on which exact fish (cod or perch) the comments were made about, but as I recall: The waitress claimed that the cod isn't "fresh" and she knew I didn't like it, so she offered to get me some perch, which was fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	That wasn't much better
FOOD	[ cod, fish stick ]	One (either the cod or the perch) of them tasted, looked like and smelled like a "fish stick
FOOD	[ O  ]	" It literally looked like a kiddie meal
FOOD	[ fish ]	All in all, I will never return for a fish fry there
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitress was very attentive and tried to make me happy, but it was not her fault, she did everything she could to please me
FOOD	[ Fish, Tea ]	Service = 5 star, Atmosphere = 4 Star, Food (overall) = 4 Star, Fish Fry = 1 StarAnyone bashing the E as the home of the Tea Party is seriously misguided
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This place is so eclectic you might find some card carrying communists at the bar from time-to- time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Seriously, the large crowd of regulars and semi-regulars ranges from former and current Dems to the same on the Republican end
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Non-partisans, liberals, libertarians, agnostics, Catholics, retirees, got em' all at the Esquire
FOOD	[ O  ]	 John Sr
FOOD	[ O  ]	is a conservative but he welcomes everyone with genuine good cheer and gratitude for coming to his place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 More than 50 years in the Kavanaugh family - this place was LOCAL before local was trendy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Shame on you purveyors of misinformation - no better than Scotty Koch, himself
FOOD	[ O  ]	Excellent drinks at the bar from Joe, Nick and Ben (and Nate on Fridays)
FOOD	[ glass ]	 Great pours of many wines by the glass
FOOD	[ fish ]	 Terrific fish fry and food
FOOD	[ wine ]	btw - Saturday after the big 70k rally, many of us were warming up at the bar, having a drink or wine and some food and swapping "war stories" and photos from our day on the square protesting against the nit wit that was elected governor
FOOD	[ Tea ]	 Tea Party my rear end
FOOD	[ O  ]	TERRIBLE service, went here for breakfast and was in shock and awe at how bad our server was
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It took well over 45 minutes for us to get our food and there was only 1 other table in the restaurant
FOOD	[ coffee, half and half, ketchup ]	 I got our own coffee, drinks, half and half, ketchup and jam
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I will NEVER go back there again!The place sucks
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I don't care if a commie or socialist or nazi eats there
FOOD	[ O  ]	The owners are what concerns me most
FOOD	[ ass ]	I enjoyed the food the first time but when I ready they had the ass't governor holding some fricking prayer service there I was through
FOOD	[ BUTT ]	I don't care what any businesses politics are BUTT I don't want to hear or read about them
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's like Denny's built a food court at a retirement home
FOOD	[ fish ]	 If fish fry and old fashions is your thing and you want to hang out with grandma and grandpa while you eat your food, this is the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The upper crust in Maple Bluff love this place
FOOD	[ chalk ]	 The only thing I can chalk it up to is they can get wasted and not drive that far to get home
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Wood paneling decor round out this gem
FOOD	[ Fish ]	Fish fry was over cooked and greasy
FOOD	[ O  ]	People seem to like it here so maybe I just had it on a bad day
FOOD	[ brandy ]	They make a good brandy old fashioned, but otherwise I am not a fan
FOOD	[ tartar sauce ]	Like a previous reviewer, I am also grossed out by tartar sauce that has been sitting out for who-knows-how-long
FOOD	[ fish ]	And the fish fry? I really don't see any greatness there
FOOD	[ age ]	 Cave-ish interior, average clientele age of 75--really not my scene
FOOD	[ fish ]	If you're looking for a fish fry and are in madison, look no further than esquire
FOOD	[ coleslaw ]	The coleslaw is the best in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're looking to eat a lot, order the ocean perch
FOOD	[ fish ]	If you're trying to eat a light fish fry the lake perch is spectacular
FOOD	[ Beer, game ]	Beer prices are good and it's got a great homey atmosphereI'll start by saying I sat at the bar with a bunch of buddies for a game rather than actually sitting in the dining room so the comments about poor service may be legit
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, if you're looking to judge just the burgers and steaks they were great
FOOD	[ game ]	Solid atmosphere with three big screens around a bar, the place is admittedly for an older crowd but they were very accomadating when six 24 year olds strolled in for a game
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not a fan
FOOD	[ buffet ]	 We had a breakfast buffet for a meeting there and the food was
FOOD	[ buffet ]	not much of a buffet
FOOD	[ Potatoes ]	 Potatoes were cold and greasy and the rest of the food was just not very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Have not had lunch or dinner here
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife and ate there tonight
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food so so
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service not good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Efficent but not friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had the feeling she wanted to be somewhere elseAnother chain establishment
FOOD	[ Lobster ]	 The sad thing is that we "tried" to go to Red Lobster first, but were repelled by the large crowd of waiting people
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No, I don't want to stand around like cattle waiting for my pager to buzz so I can be ushered to a cramped seat, fed, branded, and ushered out again stampede style
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The mighty gods of chain restaurants everywhere are wagging their fingers at me right now saying, "what do you expect lady?"  I know, I know
FOOD	[ Olive ]	So we went to Olive Garden down the street
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No wait there
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our waitress was very young, I'll refer to her as "Sparky"
FOOD	[ wine, lasagna ]	 My dining companion had a sudden need to try some wine, so he asked Sparky what would pair well with the lasagna
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She didn't come across confident as she pointed to the list of wines on the menu that mister dining companion was holding
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She finally chose one and said that it would go well with the "meaty" dish
FOOD	[ Olive ]	 I'm not sure what either one of us was expecting because after all this is Olive Garden and we have almost zero knowledge of wines
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So de-classA!!  
FOOD	[ wine ]	After Sparky left our table, dining companion says that he expects the chosen wine to be the suck because Sparky doesn't look like she's even old enough to drink, let alone have knowledge of the fine wines
FOOD	[ wine ]	 But you know, none of this really matters when you consider the fact that compared to her we are old as dirt, and still don't know shit about wine
FOOD	[ eggplant, Parmesan ]	I had the eggplant Parmesan with Alfredo sauce
FOOD	[ marinara ]	 It usually comes with marinara, but if I'm going to have a heart attack it had better well be because of something I enjoyed eating, not something I felt like I had to eat in the name of my health!  Hell no!  
FOOD	[ wine ]	Dining companion had his red wine something or other, and he was right it sucked
FOOD	[ barrel ]	 He described it as tasting like, "the barrel it came out of"
FOOD	[ pumpkin, cheesecake ]	After the main course I had the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I made sure to look in a direction where no one could see my face before I crossed my eyes from sheer delight
FOOD	[ pumpkin, cheesecake ]	 I am a pumpkin lovin' nerd by nature, and this cheesecake was gooood
FOOD	[ O  ]	So this chain experience wasn't too bad
FOOD	[ bread ]	 The only thing that sucked was no refill on the bread sticks
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If I'm going to go slummin' at the chain restaurants, I expect the constant refills man
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Especially on those items they advertise as "bottomless" and/or "never-ending"
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Finally, Sparky took a long time to bring by the check, and this goes against the code of chain fine dining, wham, bam, thank you mam
FOOD	[ Olive ]	 Touche!Now yes I know it is yet another Olive Garden but I really felt it necessary to comment on this location
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I frequent this location when going to my families lake house in Portage
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I must say this location really stands alone
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The staff is outstanding and the service and food is always top notch
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If it was closer to Chicago this staff could easily go and work at any of the top restaurants here in Chicago
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a reliable consistent place to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Mario Batali might scoff but you know what this isn't New York, and your looking for food off the side of the interstate
FOOD	[ Lasagna, Parmesan, lasagna, parmesan, cheese, marinara ]	The service was excellent,  we started with Lasagna Fritta(Parmesan-breaded lasagna pieces, fried and served over alfredo sauce, topped with parmesan cheese and marinara sauce) this was real good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 YUMMY!  
FOOD	[ chicken, soup ]	The wife ordered the chicken dumpling soup
FOOD	[ salad ]	 I ordered a salad
FOOD	[ chicken, soup ]	 chicken dumpling soup is a traditional dish, that is very simple to prepare, and excels when done with perfection
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This one was not
FOOD	[ dumplings ]	 UGH!  The dumplings were doughy tasting blobs
FOOD	[ soup ]	 The soup had a off taste to it
FOOD	[ salad ]	  The salad was ok
FOOD	[ Manicotti, Chicken, Ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, cheese, pasta, marinara, Chicken, Marsala, chicken, breast, cheeses, tomatoes, mushrooms, marsala ]	For dinner I ordered Manicotti Formaggio with Chicken(Ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan cheese and herbs, baked in pasta rolls with marinara sauce) and the wife ordered Stuffed Chicken Marsala(Oven-roasted chicken breast stuffed with Italian cheeses and sun-dried tomatoes, topped with mushrooms and a creamy marsala sauce
FOOD	[ garlic, parmesan, mashed potatoes ]	Served with garlic parmesan mashed potatoes)
FOOD	[ dishes ]	  Both dishes tasted good, and were served hot
FOOD	[ soup, salad ]	 YUMMY!soup, salad and breadsticks
FOOD	[ min, soup ]	we were in and out in 20 min with two bowls of soup each
FOOD	[ O  ]	watch out, the drinks will get you
FOOD	[ iced tea ]	soft drinks and iced tea are like $2
FOOD	[ O  ]	50 each
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went here last night with a group of my coworkers for dinner
FOOD	[ Olive ]	It's been a long time that we've been to Olive Garden   The food was pretty good and the wait staff was AMAZING
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had the following: 
FOOD	[ Chianti, meat, risotto, salt ]	Chianti Braised Short Ribs (it's was ok, the meat was a bit overcooked/dry not juicy, risotto a bit too much salt
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Veggie seemed overcooked)
FOOD	[ Beef ]	Braised Beef & Tortelloni (really good, I was told my coworkers would get it again)
FOOD	[ portobello mushrooms, asiago, basil, marsala ]	Tender sliced short ribs and portobello mushrooms tossed with asiago-filled tortelloni in a basil-marsala sauce
FOOD	[ pasta ]	Capellini di Mare (really good, didn't smell fishy, pasta was NOT aldente though, a bit overcooked for my taste)
FOOD	[ Shrimp, pasta ]	Grilled Shrimp Caprese (pretty good per my coworker, shrimps were not overcooked, pasta a bit overcooked)
FOOD	[ O  ]	But the overall high rating for this place was more of our waiter Craig D
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Can I tell you, we've NEVER had a wait staff being so attentive for our party of 5
FOOD	[ salad ]	 He knew who got what, the timing of our drinks/salad/soups/main meals were on spot, like clockwork
FOOD	[ bread, salad, soup ]	 He made sure our drinks/water was full, the bread was fresh and warm, salad and soup refills even without us asking for more
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He made us feel like we were in a 5 star restaurant, really
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What great service, next time when we're back in town we'd go back again!Yes, it's a chain
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Is it top of the line?  No
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But the quality has greatly improved over the years and the service as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They handle groups well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This place is always on the list for my office to have lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I recommend it
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of the employees stole my sons wallet
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He left it at the table and with in a half hour is disappeared
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The management are not willing to do anything about this and say that it just disappeared and that their employees do not steal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have managed restaurants, and theft is quite common
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Ever watch restaurant undercover on Foodnetwork
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The management actually laughed at me that i would think the employees would steal
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's been over a month & I can not remember the servers name unfortunately
FOOD	[ O  ]	We arrived late on a Sunday evening on our way home from Minneapolis
FOOD	[ O  ]	 After checking into our hotel we were pleasantly surprised the restaurant was still seating
FOOD	[ O  ]	We walked in and while there was no hostess a really great brunette server welcomed us and sat us in her section that was immediately left of the bar area & first booth on the left
FOOD	[ salad ]	We ordered the salad which is pretty much a given drenched with dressing
FOOD	[ chicken, al dente ]	 We asked if we could just get a piece of grilled chicken and al dente veggies our waitress said she would check
FOOD	[ O  ]	We never ask for special orders unless its clear that similar options are on the menu
FOOD	[ chef ]	She brought out a chef to hear what we wanted
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were blown away
FOOD	[ chef ]	She cared so much about getting the order right she got a chef out there
FOOD	[ O  ]	To his credit he rocked it
FOOD	[ chicken ]	YUM! Grilled chicken & lightly cooked veggies were perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	We asked our waitress to please let him know how much we appreciated his efforts & how good they were
FOOD	[ Olive, Olive ]	Olive Garden is Olive Garden
FOOD	[ O  ]	 What can you say?  
FOOD	[ O  ]	On this visit, I was with a group of 8 people
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was insanity
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They sat us at two tables which made a weird shape
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A circle and a square?  The ability to converse was difficult
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our server was so overwhelmed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 He should have had some help
FOOD	[ Olive ]	 Then again, obviously, it is Olive Garden
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Same as usual
FOOD	[ O  ]	Similar to the Middleton one, but this one is a bit better and has better decor
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good for take out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grade: C-
FOOD	[ chicken, Chicken ]	I really hope that was chicken in my Chicken Lo-Mein
FOOD	[ O  ]	What happened to this place? What a dump
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good service but I kept wondering how old the huge mold stain on the ceiling was
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had lunch here today
FOOD	[ O  ]	All in all, the food is tasty and I've been her several times before
FOOD	[ cook ]	Unfortunately, my co-worker got a hair in her food and had to wait for them to re-cook it, but that was a huge dent in the dining experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	Been going here for years but either the quality has slid or my taste has improved because the last few times have been a disappointment
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really wanna like it as I live nearby but anymore I drive to the west side location which is not perfect but it has higher quality food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Why can't this town have one good Chinese place, I'd eat there once a week!  instead we have 50 awful ones and three mediocre
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is one of the Mediocre, but for the price it should be considerably better
FOOD	[ O  ]	 maybe this is what midwestern mall shoppers want?The food is still tasty but business seems slower lately than prior years
FOOD	[ O  ]	Still retains a great interior
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never really checked out the bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is fresh and good
FOOD	[ chicken, sesame, chicken ]	we have ordered hot and sour chicken and sesame chicken
FOOD	[ O  ]	Looks like both of them are cooked fresh
FOOD	[ soup ]	The soup is mediocre
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is really good
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is the worst Chinese food I have had could not even finish meal
FOOD	[ general tso's chicken, egg roll ]	ordered general tso's chicken with egg roll
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I do not recommend this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice decorations and inerior, that's about it
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitress is not helping at all for selecting good menu
FOOD	[ tea, pepper ]	They are charging for hot tea and pepper oil
FOOD	[ O  ]	(I guess they need to do that recover from investing for the interior
FOOD	[ O  ]	) Go ahead cross the street and go to the food court in the mall
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have better service and half lower price for the better food
FOOD	[ O  ]	After reading all the reviews i was really hesitant on going to this restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	My boyfriend and I decided to stop by since we were craving Chinese and decided to sit in the bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	Obviously everyone has a different opinion but this place was amazing!
FOOD	[ O  ]	First off, the hostess was adorable and incredibly sweet
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bartender was amazing and he made us feel right at home
FOOD	[ O  ]	And the owner of the restaurant seemed like the sweetest lady in the world
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decor was what I would expect from a Chinese restaurant but they made the restaurant feel classy and not cheap
FOOD	[ pepper, steak, tomatoes, pork, egg, foo young ]	I ordered the pepper steak no tomatoes and my boyfriend got pork egg foo young
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wow is all I can say
FOOD	[ beef, meat, rubber ]	The beef actually tasted like real fresh meat! Not the rubber fake kind you get at other cheap takeouts
FOOD	[ onions ]	The only draw back i had was that the peppers and onions were cut pretty big but that wasn't a huge issue
FOOD	[ egg, foo young, pork, bbq, pork ]	My boyfriends egg foo young was like none other and they sure didn't hold back on the sauce! The pork inside was actually Chinese bbq pork and it sure added a kick
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, the prices are a tad bit high but worth every penny! All the workers and the owner are so helpful and you can tell they really appreciate their customers
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is definitely my #1 stop for Chinese on the east side!Overall experience was disappointing
FOOD	[ O  ]	For all of the awards that they've received that they display in the entrance, this experience was not good
FOOD	[ chicken ]	Food was okay, probably one of the most bland general tsao's chicken I have ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	And last but not least, the service was terrible
FOOD	[ glass ]	I had to wait 20 minutes for my second glass of water
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you are looking for a good Chinese restaurant, your best bet is to save a few dollars and get a better meal at Panda Express at the east town mall across the street
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't know what all the bad reviews are about
FOOD	[ O  ]	I eat lunch here once a week or so and like the food and service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not bad at all!Lame, I didnt have very high expectations but had heard a very good things and I was not impressed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The bartender told me everything was fresh and prepared in house and made to order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 After I ordered the food came out literally within 1-3 mins so I know for a fact that it was not fresh or made to order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 To be honest I would have been more satisfied with food court chinese/asian food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Sad comparison i know, but true
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would not eat there again
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hands down my favorite place for Chinese food in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Consistency is key for me and IG is always consistent
FOOD	[ O  ]	The pace is slower than some restaurants, but it's worth the extra time
FOOD	[ O  ]	We eat here at least 4-5 times a year and it's always a great night with great service
FOOD	[ Cashew, Chicken, egg roll, shrimp, glass, wine, soup, chicken, broccoli, flavor ]	Cashew Chicken, egg roll, shrimp rangoon and a glass of wine = LOVE!It was not bad but the wonton soup was bland and the chicken and broccoli had almost not flavor
FOOD	[ chicken ]	Tasted like the chicken was boiled
FOOD	[ beef, pea ]	 The beef and pea pods were good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Reasonable dinner size plateImperial Garden Chinese Restaurant was recommended to us when we moved to the Madison area
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was in the area for a business lunch and we decided to try it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	The atmosphere was great for a business lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	The highback booths allow for private conversations
FOOD	[ date ]	They would also make great date booths as well
FOOD	[ conversation ]	The atmosphere was quiet and allowed for conversation
FOOD	[ O  ]	The first thing I noticed was the local art and crafts that were for sale in the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	There were handmade bags and paintings
FOOD	[ O  ]	Both were great products
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am looking forward to bringing my husband back to Imperial Garden to show him the art
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decor was welcoming and not overly kitschy - no gold waving kitty
FOOD	[ O  ]	so to all who love those
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decor was a step above
FOOD	[ General Tso's chicken ]	I ordered the General Tso's chicken (standard I know)
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	A little bland, but if you are not a fan of spicy food then it would be for you
FOOD	[ spice ]	If I ordered it again I would ask for them to kick up the spice
FOOD	[ heat ]	My colleague found the heat level just right
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was no wait for lunch during the week, The manager stopped over twice to check on our meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, a great experience and we will be back!Good food, good service and clean
FOOD	[ cashew, chicken, chicken, chicken, fried rice ]	 I had the cashew chicken, my wife had the general tsao's chicken and my son had chicken fried rice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 All were very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My only complaint, and it is very minor, is that the chairs have wheels
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is very easy to scoot yourself around unexpectedly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I will definitely return the next time I am in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I really don't know what happened with all of the negative reviewers
FOOD	[ O  ]	We've been coming to Imperial Garden since 1997
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We've tried other places, but this place is easily the best  for Chinese food anywhere in the area
FOOD	[ Chicken, Broccoli, Beef, fried rice, noodles, chicken, egg, foo young ]	Chicken & Broccoli, Beef Lo-mein, Stir fried rice noodles, steamed pot stickers, & the chicken egg foo young are all great! General Tso's is good too
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Staff is very friendly, many have been working there for 10+ years, and we are remembered when we come in- a nice touch
FOOD	[ O  ]	We've been to the westside location as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good, but not as good as East, if you ask me
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you don't believe me, take a look at the wall in the lobby
FOOD	[ O  ]	They've won best in Madison nearly every year since 1987! How many restaurants around now can say the same thing??My husband and I returned to Imperial Garden for dinner with our children
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were there on a Friday night
FOOD	[ min ]	There was a bit of a wait (about 20 min), but nothing out of the ordinary for a Friday night around 5:30 pm
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had another great experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	We found IG family friendly and able to accommodate our two children without disturbing any other guests
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our five year old loved the experience and the food as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	And as parents know, if your children are happy, you are happy
FOOD	[ lo mein ]	We ordered the (very affordable I might add) lo mein for our daughter
FOOD	[ leftovers, lo mein ]	It was good and there were plenty of leftovers between the lo mein and the two entrees we ordered
FOOD	[ shrimp, egg, foo young ]	Try the shrimp egg foo young
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is the best ever
FOOD	[ shrimp, fried rice, vegetables ]	 The shrimp fried rice is great, good with vegetables
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't forget the bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A lot of people like to stop in
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The bartender is friendly, just like the show Cheers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You can order and eat at the bar if you want
FOOD	[ O  ]	The manager Rose is elegant and full of laughter
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No worries at this place
FOOD	[ dishes, chicken, rice soup, beef, beef ]	Two fav dishes are the chicken sizzling rice soup and the princess beef (which they don't have on the menu anymore; closest dish is the oyster beef)
FOOD	[ fruit, punch ]	Also love ordering the tropical fruit punch
FOOD	[ O  ]	Has a nice atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wish it wasn't so pricy but the food is great
FOOD	[ soup, Peking duck ]	Would continue to go back for some soup and maybe try the Peking duck sometime
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not that high on the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	We really enjoyed our meal there
FOOD	[ dishes, curry, beef, egg, foo young, chicken ]	 We ordered a variety of dishes including curry beef,  egg foo young and Governor's chicken
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 Nothing trendy,  just reliable Chinese dishes
FOOD	[ beef, egg, foo young ]	 Everything was fresh,  and the beef egg foo young was especially good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We'd return
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best Chinese food in Midwest
FOOD	[ Bay ]	 I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, and the quality here matches any Chinese restaurant back home!This place is mediocre at best
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My husband and I ordered for carry out
FOOD	[ crab, appetizer, crab ]	 We ordered the crab rangoons as an appetizer, however, I think they forgot to add the crab to the filling
FOOD	[ cream cheese, flavor ]	 The were stuffed with chunks of cream cheese--very boring and lacking in flavor
FOOD	[ General Tso's Chicken, Cashew, Shrimp ]	 My husband ordered the General Tso's Chicken and I ordered Cashew Shrimp, neither of which were remarkable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We are going to keep trying to find a decent Chinese restaurant in the Madison area, that's for sure
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place gets top marks from me
FOOD	[ O  ]	  The food was delicious and prices are very favorable
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service was very polite and prompt
FOOD	[ tofu, eggplant, basil ]	 I asked to add tofu (NOT fried) to my eggplant/Thai basil dish
FOOD	[ frying, tofu ]	 Normally I get arguments about not frying my tofu (I really, really don't care for fried), but not here
FOOD	[ chef ]	 The chef expertly prepared my meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The seasoning and sauce was really nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The sauce was just the right amount
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If I had to say one thing
FOOD	[ rice ]	the rice was a little sticky, but I can totally see past that because the overall meal was just great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I enjoyed the left overs the next day
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very good lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	$30
FOOD	[ O  ]	00 for three of us
FOOD	[ dumplings, appetizer ]	Steamed dumplings for appetizer
FOOD	[ shrimp, mien, cashew, chicken, egg rolls ]	2 shrimp lo-mien and 1 cashew chicken with egg rolls
FOOD	[ shrimp, noodles ]	Almost an entire plate of shrimp and noodles to take home
FOOD	[ Snack, cashew, chicken ]	Snack of cashew chicken taken home also
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great service and very good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	We'll be back when we come again to Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not sure why this place has so many good reviews as the food is not Chinese! I'm a Chinese girl myself and I know how Chinese food should taste like
FOOD	[ mixture ]	And this place does not have the authentic Chinese taste, in fact, it is a mixture of American, Thai and Chinese altogether which makes me disappointed
FOOD	[ beef, lo mein, pork, lo mein ]	However, what makes me even more disappointed was when I ordered beef lo mein, The waiter was too busy chitchatting with guests and put in pork lo mein instead
FOOD	[ O  ]	When I called him back (it was a takeout order) he was saying it was his mistake and will credit that for my future order and refused to replace it! I was like, really? Definitely will not come back and  not recommend this place to friends and family!Ordered food for delivery at a local hotel after 8 hours on the road
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Gave all details of where we were staying and after an hour and 15 minutes got a call asking why we had not picked up our food
FOOD	[ fork ]	 Were told there was no indication on the order that it was delivery!  Terrible miscommunication at their end!  When food arrived it was cold and not one fork or napkin in the bag
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very frustrating for hungry weary travelers
FOOD	[ O  ]	be careful if you are ordering delivery from this place!This bar had become something of a second home to me on Monday nights for the 2
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 years we lived in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 During most of the week it's a nice blue collar hangout, but on Monday's it keeps the blue collar drink pricing, but adds some of the best live funk and soul music to be found in the midwest
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Also check out Wednesday nights for the open jam session they have weekly
FOOD	[ beer, Moose ]	  Best beer on tap? Moose Drool hands down
FOOD	[ O  ]	Unpretentious Wisconsin-y hangout with good live music
FOOD	[ O  ]	Welcome to my exclusive 1-star club, Mr
FOOD	[ O  ]	Roberts
FOOD	[ O  ]	I went here to see a friend's band play, despite my boyfriend's warning that it was not the greatest bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I do so love dive bars--how bad could it be?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's so bad
FOOD	[ stage ]	 It's past the stage of being a fun dive bar, it's just plain frightening
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The people looked like the kind of scary, angry drunks you would only encounter in a movie
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The bathroom stall was so little that had I weighed 20 pounds more, I probably would have gotten wedged in (the door opened inward, not outward)
FOOD	[ O  ]	We did not stay long, I did not regret it, and won't be back
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Ick, yuck, blech, and ptooey
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Why would anyone think this is a good place?!I fully appreciate that Mr
FOOD	[ O  ]	Roberts is a blue collar dive bar that's located on Atwood
FOOD	[ O  ]	So when a friend asked me to join him to watch a favorite band there, I set my expectations accordingly
FOOD	[ O  ]	Is it possible for an establishment to disappoint you when you've already lowered your expectations to crackhouse-lows? Only if that establishment is Mr
FOOD	[ O  ]	Roberts
FOOD	[ bread ]	The tap beers are not only unexciting, they're as stale and flat as day old bread that's been run over by a steamroller
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Bartenders are more interested in talking with their buddies than they are helping anyone
FOOD	[ O  ]	And the whole vibe of this place is more sketchy than an Etch-A-Sketch wearing Sketchers
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd give anything to not be stuck here right now
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm scared to death of what might be lurking in the bathrooms
FOOD	[ O  ]	Think I'll go pee in the parking lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	Mr
FOOD	[ O  ]	Roberts is not a place I'd ever go to for the sole purpose of going out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Both times I've gone have been for bands, and both times were fairly different experiences
FOOD	[ O  ]	My first time was a one-star experience: it was ridiculously hot and humid inside, the staff lacked any sort of motivation for good customer service, and they crammed the 7- or 8-piece band in the front of the bar near the window, making for awkward viewing and playing
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sound was terrible and I spent more time outside than in
FOOD	[ O  ]	My second time was a better experience, but still not one that would cause me to suggest other people go there
FOOD	[ O  ]	This time around it was a reasonable temperature in the bar, but that may only be due to the fact that it was in the 50s outside
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bands played in the back of the bar in an alcove/side room deal and it made a lot more sense
FOOD	[ mixer ]	The sound was still deafening and subject to random strangers twiddling the knobs on the mixer, but overall not too bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	Free music is the best thing (only thing?) Mr
FOOD	[ O  ]	Roberts has going for it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its biggest downsides:
FOOD	[ bottle, beer ]	- it's touted as a blue-collar bar, but it's more an excuse to be shabby and dirty than anything; $15 for a 5-bottle bucket of beer is not a good deal, and $5 for a PBR & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when it should be the standard price for such a combination
FOOD	[ bowl ]	- the ladies room is ridiculously tiny and awkward, had a seat that was half hanging off the bowl, and no TP
FOOD	[ O  ]	- every surface was dirty or sticky, yuck
FOOD	[ O  ]	You probably won't die if you go to see a friend's band play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside
FOOD	[ O  ]	Come on people, it's Mr
FOOD	[ O  ]	Roberts
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a dive bar, it's stinky, dingy, sometimes scary and that's the way it's supposed to be, to keep the squeamish out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quit being haters, there are plenty of white-washed established to frequent for the faint of heart
FOOD	[ beer, bottle ]	As for the crap tap beer-order a bottle
FOOD	[ O  ]	I for one am thankful that shit-holes like this exist
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's not that bad of a place if you go in at the right time (8 PM)
FOOD	[ cover ]	 But be careful you will get hit with a Sublime cover band
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food is regular bar food and nothing special
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Drinks are cheap and the bar is long there are plenty of places to sit
FOOD	[ Fruit ]	 There is a pool table and video poker (All Fruit Bonus)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very Sconnie however a little seedy for the faint of heart
FOOD	[ O  ]	Haha - this place is tawesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	A group of my friends caught a comedian at the Barrymore Theatre and had some time to kill beforehand
FOOD	[ O  ]	We wanted to find a place to eat nearby but everywhere had a 15 minute wait - and we didn't have that kind of time before the show
FOOD	[ O  ]	We setled for Mr
FOOD	[ Grill ]	Roberts Bar and Grill, and what a hoot it was!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	First off, their food was okay
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing to rave or complain about
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu is limited though - it definitely isn't really a place to go to eat
FOOD	[ beer ]	They didn't have any drink specials, which made me sad :( I'm used to just getting whatever beer is on sale, because I like everything, but no such luck
FOOD	[ beer ]	However, they aren't expensive so I paid about 4 dollars for a beer I think
FOOD	[ O  ]	The best part of this place is that it is totally divey, and it had a lot of interesting characters
FOOD	[ conversation ]	This drunk 30 year old guy played pool with my friend and had a lengthy conversation with me about how he used to unpack semi trucks or something
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't know
FOOD	[ gin, tonic, rum ]	My friends would say the best part about this place is their mixed drinks (a gin and tonic and a rum and coke I think?) came in pint sizes - haha
FOOD	[ O  ]	Biggest mixed drinks they'd ever seen
FOOD	[ O  ]	Can't vouch for how strong they were - but large none the less
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wouldn't say this place is a destination, at all, but next time you're at the Barrymore, it is a cool place to check out next door for a drink
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service at Mr
FOOD	[ O  ]	Roberts is okay, but the free live music is what pulls me in! Drinks are reasonably priced too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Another east-side dive bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	not great, but not bad either
FOOD	[ candle ]	I never went into the old Tip Top (because I was far too terrified) but there is no way it held a candle to the current Tip Top
FOOD	[ O  ]	Basically, the place looks fantastic from ceiling to floor
FOOD	[ O  ]	It now makes sense why the remodel took so long and it was clearly worth the wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's exactly what you'd want a neighborhood bar to be
FOOD	[ O  ]	Small but not too small, inviting atmosphere, comfortable lighting, and no over the top decorating
FOOD	[ beer, whisky ]	I had a beer and a very good whisky sour
FOOD	[ O  ]	Looking forward to heading back soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	Dropped-by for a quick drink on 1/30/14 at around 8:30pm
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Super cool dive bar that isn't really a dive bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Very cozy inside, but in a really good way - feels "homey" and comfy
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Awesome decor - the fixtures, the wood walls, the tin ceiling, the tables/chairs
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Attention to detail like none other; little things make the whole (and they make it great)
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Even the bathrooms are excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ It's like the tap list was made just for me
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Two nitro brews on tap, IPAs, Karben4, Upland - a really great mix
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Super reasonable prices - $4 for excellent pints? Here's a $20; pry me off the floor when I'm done
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Waitstaff was very responsive, very prompt, and super friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	- So noisy; sound really carries in the place
FOOD	[ old man ]	+ It's a bar - it's supposed to be noisy, so deal with it, old man Steve
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grabbed a small table near the back/side wall
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ben, the owner, introduced himself and was so welcoming, gracious, and sincere
FOOD	[ O  ]	He's done an amazing job with this place and I'm confident it's going to be a smashing success
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love that it's just a few blocks from my house, because I know I'm going to be here often
FOOD	[ O  ]	Can't wait to try the food - the menu sounds and looks like a perfect match to the neighborhood, while honoring the spirit of the joint
FOOD	[ date, conversation ]	Would I go here with a date or someone that I wanted to have a good, solid conversation with? Probably not - it's just a little too noisy for that
FOOD	[ O  ]	But for any and every other occasion? Absofreakinglutely
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very, very cool place
FOOD	[ O  ]	Man, Madison is getting so many great new places that it is hard for me to keep track! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Tip Top Tavern is one of those spots I always drove by and thought "Man, what a dive
FOOD	[ O  ]	I bet It's great", but never got around to visiting
FOOD	[ O  ]	So, when I found out they had opened back up with a new owner, a food menu, and a new look I decided I had better get over there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seriously, folks - what a great little place
FOOD	[ beer, Dogfish, Ale, beer ]	After a bit of a rough start where-in I ordered a beer that I couldn't even look at because it was so awful  (the Dogfish Head T'weason Ale - what a disaster of a beer
FOOD	[ cocktail ]	They were super cool and replaced it with their house old-fashioned, which was one of the best takes on the cocktail I have ever had) the meal went really smooth - especially considering how crazy busy it was
FOOD	[ cheese, curds, fish ]	Between the three of us we ordered 2 burgers, cheese curds, and the fish fry special
FOOD	[ O  ]	The burger was delicious, moist, and cooked extremely well
FOOD	[ coleslaw, vinegar ]	The coleslaw was tasty, but had way too much vinegar
FOOD	[ fries ]	The fries were crispy and free of excess oil which was nice
FOOD	[ fish ]	Apparently the fish was delicious as well
FOOD	[ curds ]	Finally - the curds
FOOD	[ curds ]	Oh man, the curds! They were seriously (tip) top-notch
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lightly breaded, crispy, and gooey with some nice tasting ranch on the side
FOOD	[ O  ]	These are the closest to perfection I have ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hopefully it wasn't a fluke!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Beyond the food and drink, it really was a nice space
FOOD	[ beer ]	The lighting was great, the decorations were were fun, and it just felt like a cozy place that I would love to hang out at on a Wednesday night to grab a burger and a beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	I feel like all I have done lately is write about how awesome the spots I go to are, but hopefully that says more about how great Madison is than it does about my (potentially) overly-optimistic ratings
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place has gotten quite a dramatic face-lift
FOOD	[ O  ]	It looks great
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love everything they've done with the place
FOOD	[ chili ]	I tried the Tip Top Burger and the chili
FOOD	[ O  ]	The burger was fine, but not spectacular
FOOD	[ chili ]	The chili was really freaking delicious, though
FOOD	[ bowl ]	I would highly recommend grabbing a bowl
FOOD	[ O  ]	The space is pretty small, but there is actually a lot of seating
FOOD	[ O  ]	It does get pretty loud though
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff members were all very nice and did a great job
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bitchy people  next to us were treated a lot nicer than they deserved
FOOD	[ O  ]	A waiter mixed up an order and was very apologetic and quickly resolved the issue
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, I'm happy that the place is finally open
FOOD	[ O  ]	A welcome addition to the neighborhood
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love that the best of this classic Wisconsin tavern was preserved whilst providing a much-needed facelift
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a great addition to the neighborhood
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were there the week it opened and I enjoyed a few creative cocktails
FOOD	[ beer, beer ]	My husband, a beer aficionado, loved the beer list, which includes 2 nitro taps
FOOD	[ fish ]	We were there again last night with friends for the fish fry
FOOD	[ sandwich, BLT, egg ]	When I read the menu, I was intrigued by the Rooster sandwich, which is essentially a BLT + fried egg
FOOD	[ fish ]	I'm so glad I tried this instead of the fish because it was really good
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	It's such a large sandwich, though, it is probably better to split with a friend
FOOD	[ bacon, bacon, sandwich ]	I can't believe I'm going to write this, but there may have been TOO much bacon (although I managed to eat the entire thing)! If you love bacon, this is the sandwich for you!
FOOD	[ fish ]	My husband had the fish, which was a nice piece of walleye and perfectly fried
FOOD	[ cole, slaw, slaw ]	He doesn't normally like cole slaw but specifically noted how much he liked the slaw
FOOD	[ tartar sauce, dill ]	He also liked the tartar sauce, and said it was enhanced with dill
FOOD	[ New Year ]	We live less than 2 miles from Tip Top, so we look forward to spending more time there, especially when we can bike there during warmer months!I could say "This is a tip top spot!" but that would be CHEESY and my New Year's resolution 23 years ago was to avoid such things
FOOD	[ O  ]	ANYways
FOOD	[ O  ]	I definitely liked the ambiance of this space a lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	A charming neighborhood bar with horizontal narrow wood paneling, lower lighting, tiled floor, tin ceiling, and a very pretty border/trim around the ceiling
FOOD	[ beat, rush ]	Being a small-ish space with lower ceilings and hard floors, it does get a bit noisy when the place fills up so best to beat the rush if you're sensitive to that sort of thing
FOOD	[ stock ]	Also, it's another CASH ONLY spot so be sure to stock up or else they have an ATM on site
FOOD	[ O  ]	My co-workers and I headed here for drinks one Friday
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place seemed to have a "must order food" policy in order to be seated at the tables so 15 of us frustratingly spent a bit of time crowded at the entrance, downing beers, trying to decide if we should move on
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	Fortunately, I think the staff finally figured out that two beers basically equals the cost of a sandwich (so what's the difference) and we got a nice row of tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Whew!  The place was definitely running a wait by 6:30pm so, again, head out early/late!
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Mister and I headed here at 6pm on a Saturday and were able to snag the last open table in the place
FOOD	[ beer ]	The beer list is good and reasonably priced ($4)
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	 The menu offers burgers, apps, and sandwiches and sports several vegetarian options
FOOD	[ O  ]	Mr
FOOD	[ sandwich, Seitan ]	had the special (Walleye sandwich) which he enjoyed while I had the Seitan Philly ($8
FOOD	[ O  ]	95), also tasty
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	We started with the cheese curds ($5
FOOD	[ O  ]	95) which were yummy
FOOD	[ kettle, chips, dip, chips, dip, pickles ]	I'd previously had the kettle chips/dip, which were just that, chips/dip, nothing fancy and the fried pickles which weren't my favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	All in all I really liked the ambiance (but I'd go early so I can hear better) and appreciate the reasonably priced & yummy options for both vegetarians and carnivores
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I hope they are able to work out the kinks along the way (i
FOOD	[ O  ]	, must order food to get a seat policy) but overall think this is a very nice addition to the neighborhood
FOOD	[ O  ]	Small but high-quality menu selections with locally sourced foods
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good value for what you get
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Great selection of microbrew beers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our waiter was very attentive and a nice guy
FOOD	[ O  ]	TheTip Top Tavern has opened again after a major remodel
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was well worth the wait
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is now cozy, cute, and tiny
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great for those who prefer unique destinations over corporate chains
FOOD	[ O  ]	Went here for the first time last night
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Cozy is the first word that comes to mind
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food we tried was a mixed bag
FOOD	[ Sweet potato, fries, waffle, sweet potato ]	 Sweet potato fries were waffle-style, and not very sweet potato-ey
FOOD	[ pickles, Chili, Cheese ]	 The fried pickles had a nice spicy kick, and the Green Chili Mac & Cheese hit the spot
FOOD	[ Savory ]	 Savory, creamy and spicy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 About a dozen great beers on tap, and nicely-priced and delicious cocktails
FOOD	[ O  ]	But I think I'd still rather just go to Mickey's!I love the Tip Top
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have eaten here half a dozen times and everything has been delicious and reasonable
FOOD	[ wine, pastrami ]	 The drinks and the wine selection are great for a bar of it's size and the owner is fantastic!  I especially recommend the pastrami reuben
FOOD	[ O  ]	Stopped by for a late meal on a Thursday night and the place was quite lively, but there were still a few tables open
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The servers all seemed to be having a good time and took excellent care of us, checking in just enough but not too much
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu is small, but has something for everyone
FOOD	[ carnitas ]	 We tried the carnitas - flavorful and tender - and a burger - expertly seasoned and juicy
FOOD	[ carnitas, egg ]	 Both were slightly overcooked: the burger arrived more medium rare than the requested rare, and on the carnitas the yolk of one fried egg was deliciously soft, while the other was just a bit too set
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However the high quality ingredients and delightful flavors evened out any imperfections
FOOD	[ beer ]	 The drink menu was well rounded and we enjoyed both the beer and cocktails
FOOD	[ O  ]	The small touches in design elevate the interior from the ordinary in an entirely pleasing way
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Tip Top is a great addition to the neighborhood and I look forward to enjoying it again soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	I never set foot in the old Tip Top so couldn't attest to the transformation which I hear is remarkable
FOOD	[ O  ]	What I can say is this is my favorite all-around bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	Justin is a good down to earth guy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Even when it's busy he takes time to talk and makes custom drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can definitely say Tip Top has the best mixed drinks in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	Add the tasteful decor and the decent pub food and this is one of the best neighborhood/dive bars in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I came in yesterday with a pretty big group of ten plus we sat on the patio which was very nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	The waitress was very polite and was checking on us pretty consistently :)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This was the first time I had been there since it was redone and I really liked how it looked
FOOD	[ Chipotle, Chicken, Wild Rice, soup, pickles ]	 My friend and I tried the Chipotle Chicken and Wild Rice soup it was so delicious even on that very hot day so kudos to that!  I also tried one of the fried pickles with the sauce it came with it was also very good! Had a good time here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love!   We will be back, and back often
FOOD	[ O  ]	 As our summer Saturday dining trek continues this is the epitome of what we want
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A local joint, that just makes you comfortable and glad to be out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Arrived about 6:30 on a Saturday, and found our way to the new back patio
FOOD	[ choice ]	 A couple of larger groups, but plenty of choice of seating
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Found our table, and service was immediate-friendly, attentive, and just exceptional
FOOD	[ O  ]	 KR had barely ordered and couldn't stop gushing about her love of this place
FOOD	[ pickles ]	We started with the fried pickles, based on previous reviews, and they were perfectly done
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	KR had the Rooster sandwich and enjoyed it so much, she only offered me a tiny bite, As I'm unable to order the same, I was forced to the Tip Top burger, and was not disappointed
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 Perfectly done, and flavor throughout
FOOD	[ beverage ]	After another beverage, and just enjoying the evening, we got our check and headed out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thanks to other reviews, we knew CASH only, but there is an ATm, so heads up!
FOOD	[ balance ]	Perfect, exactly what we wanted, and this sets the bar for us for the balance of our summer Saturday dining trek
FOOD	[ O  ]	We've been coming here since January 2014 and have never been disappointed
FOOD	[ catfish ]	I usually order the catfish po' boy, but alas it has been taken off the menu
FOOD	[ Tuna, Gouda ]	No worries, it turns out that a new addition, the Tuna So Gouda, is also a winner
FOOD	[ mayonnaise, capers, dijon mustard, basil ]	Not too mayonnaise-y, the flavors are capers, dijon mustard and basil
FOOD	[ rye ]	Served on rye, it's a big win
FOOD	[ beer ]	The beer list isn't huge but it's got all the best of the bunch and changes often
FOOD	[ O  ]	The noise level can be challenging, given the small size of the place and the fact that it's usually packed
FOOD	[ greens ]	Love the interior, very art deco-ish in blues, greens and golds, warm and inviting
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is friendly, attentive and prompt
FOOD	[ pickles, appetizer, batter, tempura ]	The fried pickles are a must-have appetizer, they're slices rather than spears, and the batter is a light tempura style
FOOD	[ O  ]	They're served with the Tip Top sauce, a spicy sriracha aeoli
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delish
FOOD	[ O  ]	Had me wishing for another round :-)
FOOD	[ O  ]	They were surprisingly not busy last night probably due to the extensive road work currently happening right in front and all around the building
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now would be a great time to check them out if you haven't, it will be quieter and no waiting
FOOD	[ O  ]	Time for an update, as it's been 6 months since my initial review, and I've revisited at least 15 times since then
FOOD	[ beat ]	+ The atmosphere can't be beat
FOOD	[ O  ]	Love the space
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Still quite noisy; certain voices (and annoying laughs) seem to really carry here
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ The staff is excellent; honest, helpful, friendly, courteous - truly professional
FOOD	[ Beer ]	+ Beer list remains nearly identical to what it was 6 months ago, and that's OK by me
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Several taps on nitrogen - yummmmmmm
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Now has outdoor patio behind the bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ The food is superb
FOOD	[ pickles ]	+ Fried pickles - get them
FOOD	[ O  ]	(oh, and you're welcome)
FOOD	[ Sandwiches ]	+ Sandwiches - all are outstanding
FOOD	[ Fish ]	+ Fish fry is very, very solid
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Onsite ATM with reasonable service fee
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Cash only
FOOD	[ O  ]	Remains one of my very favorite places to visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finally go to the Tip Top last night for dinner and had a great experience
FOOD	[ block ]	 Great job with the remodel, and the outdoor patio is very nice as they put up a high enough fence to block the street and make it private, but it is lareg enough to be fun
FOOD	[ liquor, beer ]	 Excellent liquor and beer selections at reasonable prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food was way better than expected - huge portions, excellent quality, and nicely different than the usual Madtown fare
FOOD	[ pickles, tempura, batter, batter, pickles ]	We had fried pickles which were done with tempura batter so they were not heavy and the slight sweetness of the batter nicely offset the brininess of the pickles
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Huge basket with a great home made dipping sauce ( a remoulade) as well
FOOD	[ pepper, cheese, balance ]	  Then, thank God cause it is also big, we split a plate of two pepper mac 'n cheese, which was cooked perfectly and the jalapenos were offset perfectly by the poblanos for a flavorful balance
FOOD	[ O  ]	Twelve taps, good cocktails, great service and a friendly atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Hope you do well Tip Top!I started going here on and off about eight years ago
FOOD	[ pizza ]	The pizza is the best, but the burgers (veggie and regular) are very good as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's bar food at its very best
FOOD	[ chips ]	Hot chips with dipping sauce are good too! There's often bands on the weekends, and the occasional lesbian after bowling league get together, but not angry, man-hating, shemales
FOOD	[ beer ]	Quite a few different groups of people get together for good beer, food and music at reasonable prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	Grade: B Slow to no service - no big deal
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great, inexpensive food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Warning: Do not make eye contact with the angry trustfund hippies lurking about here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Enjoy!Some of the best bar food in the state
FOOD	[ Pizza, choice ]	 Burgers and Pizza are always a fantastic choice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Entertainment is hit or miss, but at least they have some
FOOD	[ beer ]	 However, my favorite reason to go here is it serves the coldest tap beer ever!!!Pretty cool neighborhood bar that's a lot more than just a bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I mean, at dinnertime on Friday night there were families eating here with lots of kids
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That's kind of weird to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	 First, I wouldn't think it would be appropriate to take young kids to a bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Second, I don't really want to be around kids when I go to a bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But everyone seemed to be perfectly happy with it, so that makes me the odd man out
FOOD	[ O  ]	We had burgers, and they were pretty good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The menu had all the usual pub grub, and they also make pizzas
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Many people were eating them, but we didn't try it, so, shrug
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	 We also had cheese curds
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	 They were, well, cheese curds
FOOD	[ O  ]	(I'm sorry, I'm not a huge fan, so I can't tell the quality)
FOOD	[ O  ]	One weird thing was that you had to go up to the side of the bar to place your order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This made it confusing how to leave a tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	 On the table, or with the person you placed the order with?  
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, we enjoyed it here, but we probably wouldn't come back during dinner hour, as the atmosphere was a bit weird for us
FOOD	[ walnut ]	I go to the Harmony for their delicious walnut burgers 
FOOD	[ O  ]	or I order take out when I don't feel like sitting in a really dark bar at 1pm in the afternoon
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Harmony is super laid back, full of young and old, the noon drinkers and the nearly dead
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bartenders are nice, they have a pool table and juke box, a few tv's
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would say it's definitely more of an older crowd/neighborhood bar feel, which is pretty refreshing from the bars full of dbags on State Street
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Harmony is a solid bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	I just want to mention that we came back on a Sunday afternoon at around 8:30
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	 We ordered burgers and cheese curds
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	 They tasted a lot like burgers and cheese curds
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I also don't think the prices are that great on further reflection
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	 6 dollars for a stinkin cheeseburger?  That's not great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 3 dollars for a pabst?  
FOOD	[ O  ]	But the place was kid free this time
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That's nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would give higher ratings, but some drunk regular yelled at us for ordering from the menu instead of the "board
FOOD	[ O  ]	"  Unpleasant
FOOD	[ walnut, blue cheese, chips, Cow ]	Harmony, I blame you for my insatiable craving for a walnut burger coupled with your hot blue cheese chips and a Spotted Cow
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh
FOOD	[ O  ]	My
FOOD	[ O  ]	God
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fantastic!!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Harmony is also great as a local hang out with the neighborhood guys and gals
FOOD	[ O  ]	Super comfy atmosphere, live music, & clean bathrooms
FOOD	[ O  ]	All very good
FOOD	[ Har, beer ]	The Harmony - or the Har Bar as my friends call it, is always an inviting and friendly place to have a beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's a neighborhood bar in the truest sense of the word, locals walk and bike to the place which is situated in one of the greatest areas of Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is really nice, an up-scaled bar menu
FOOD	[ Walnut ]	 The signature dish, the "Walnut Burger" is truly fantastic
FOOD	[ meat ]	 Forget about it as a meat-alternative, this burger is a unique creation all its own that will make you have desperate cravings
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The space is large, divided in two, one half the main bar area and the other a large space with family-style tables where groups gather and bands sometimes play at night
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Here you will find the livers of the pure Madison lifestyle celebrating their lives
FOOD	[ O  ]	 These people are happy and they might just make you happy too
FOOD	[ brew ]	The hubby and I always default to Harmony Bar when we have a craving for a good burger and a local brew (even before noon)
FOOD	[ blue cheese ]	My favorite is the blue burger-a burger smothed in blue cheese and all the traditional toppings
FOOD	[ pizza ]	The pizzas are worth waiting for-check on the days and times they'll make a pizza for you
FOOD	[ O  ]	As always a smoke free environment is worth driving to Madison for
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not a local, which means I don't really understand the appeal of the Harmony
FOOD	[ chips, dip ]	Hot chips and dip? I'll eat 'em, but they're not the stuff dreams are made of
FOOD	[ O  ]	Old-school cafeteria-style tables? Dim lighting, rickety tables and chairs? Kids (like, aged 6 and under) running wild and telling my group of adults to stop swearing? Guess I'm just a snob
FOOD	[ gin ]	On the plus side, gin & tonics were $3 each on a Friday night
FOOD	[ walnut, chips ]	Oh how I miss you, Harmony Bar!  I never miss a chance to grab a walnut burger and hot chips when I'm back in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is just a wonderful neighborhood bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is still "bar" food but it's quality, tasty and made fresh to order
FOOD	[ pizza ]	 The pizza is good, too
FOOD	[ beer ]	 Good beer selection and a truly local atmosphere
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The Harmony fits right into the vibe of the neighborhood
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh how I miss you, Harmony Bar!I like bars that are a little rough around the edges, but they don't usually have good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Harmony, on the other hand, manages to come through quite nicely in the food department
FOOD	[ walnut, potato, chips ]	I had a walnut burger and an order of their potato chips which they apparently make fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The burger was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Large but not too large, a little bit messy, and just the right amount of toppings
FOOD	[ chips ]	 The chips were great too
FOOD	[ O  ]	at first
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Though I have to say that they started to feel a bit heavy about half way through
FOOD	[ chips ]	 They're still good, just be warned that if you eat an entire thing of chips your heart might explode
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I could give the Harmony less than one star, I would
FOOD	[ O  ]	I live in the Shenk-Atwood neighborhood, so I'm not writing as an outsider
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been to the Harmony many times, but I'm finally done being abused by the notoriously unfriendly owner, bartenders and waitstaff at the Harmony
FOOD	[ Soup ]	The Harmony is worse than Seinfeld's Soup Nazi because there's no irony or humor in being treated the way the employees here treat their customers
FOOD	[ O  ]	I won't get into specifics
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can only say that I take pride in my neighborhood
FOOD	[ O  ]	My wife and I frequent those establishments that understand that they are part of a community and treat their paying customers as such
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Harmony is a black mark on our neighborhood, and I am ashamed that unsuspecting visitors to the quaint east side should have to endure the abusive, disrespectful and generally unapologetic service at this establishment
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you scroll down you'll read other comments about the owner's girlfriend who is now manager
FOOD	[ O  ]	The last time I was in there with a group of friends, she couldn't have been more rude or insulting
FOOD	[ O  ]	When we all said we wouldn't be back, she merely shrugged her shoulders
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're visiting the East Side, there are plenty of other places that serve great food with friendly service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Alchemy, Mickey's, Wilson's, The Weary Traveller all come to mind as places that will make you feel and taste the love on the East Side
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you're a masochist, be sure to head on over The Harmony for your daily dose of abuse
FOOD	[ O  ]	You've been warned
FOOD	[ O  ]	You certainly won't catch me sitting at this bar ever again
FOOD	[ O  ]	The unfriendly atmosphere at The Harmony Bar is its biggest failing
FOOD	[ Soup ]	 At first I thought it was just sarcastic "Soup Nazi" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band
FOOD	[ lights, stage ]	 I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was floored
FOOD	[ stage ]	 It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early
FOOD	[ O  ]	The kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front
FOOD	[ O  ]	 (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab
FOOD	[ O  ]	) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service
FOOD	[ O  ]	In short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There are too many other fun places to go in Madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at The "Harmony"
FOOD	[ walnut ]	Burgers are awesome whether you go walnut or regular
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prompt, attentive staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great beers on tap
FOOD	[ O  ]	No snobs and the place has a sense of humor about itself
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's good stuff
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is where YELP gets odd - any idea the demographics for the other reviewers? 
FOOD	[ O  ]	As a neighborhood bar, yes you are expected to behave - and geez, not having easy tabs going and having to pay as you go may be a pain
FOOD	[ O  ]	But really?! there's a cash machine right next to the pool table
FOOD	[ O  ]	Do the owners have a right to close down when it's bar time, indeed
FOOD	[ O  ]	What a bunch of whinners!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Drinks are served well and timely
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Better than good - hot, made to order, and fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	Kids are expected to behave (and ours have been reminded as have we - good for all)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Do we go there for yummy, fun times with friends, yes! Are we grateful a local, privately owned business maintains it's unique flavors
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cheers to the Harmony!The Harmony grows on you
FOOD	[ O  ]	For a bar of its kind (neighborhood, slightly older demographics on the whole, cheapish), the food is great
FOOD	[ walnut, cheese ]	I am addicted to the walnut burger with cheese
FOOD	[ dishes ]	It is vegetarian and one of two or three dishes I'll really miss when I leave Madison
FOOD	[ chips, blue cheese, dip ]	The chips and blue cheese dip are also awesome

FOOD	[ O  ]	They've all been good to great
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love sitting at the bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a bar that no matter your gender, you can go and eat alone at and not feel odd or out of place
FOOD	[ O  ]	The bartenders (who function as servers) are neither overly friendly nor out of sight
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are attentive, but leave you appropriately alone while you are eating and drinking
FOOD	[ O  ]	Although I don't have kids, I am often with those who have them, and this is a great place to bring kids
FOOD	[ O  ]	They can run around the back room and on Fridays, you'll find lots of other kids
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is also a great place to watch sports events
FOOD	[ O  ]	The other week, I called up and asked if the bartenders would put the Tour de France on for me and a couple of friends, and he said yes and gave us free reign of the large-screen tv in the back
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh yes--bring cash, although there is an ATM if you forget to
FOOD	[ O  ]	The perfect place for the near-east side
FOOD	[ walnut ]	Good to very good drinks (depending on the bar tender) and yummy pub food -- especially the walnut burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	It has a workaday feel, with a side of liberal politics and an accepting and welcoming attitude
FOOD	[ O  ]	Somehow it's not overpopulated with posers which makes it just about my favorite place in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	I see that all the negative reviews for this business have been flagged
FOOD	[ O  ]	To those thinking of trying this establishment: READ THE FLAGGED REVIEWS
FOOD	[ O  ]	You will have a far more balanced and accurate assessment
FOOD	[ O  ]	Attended Harmony bar to watch the Peoples Brothers Band
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The band was great and I was awarded 3rd place in their costume contest
FOOD	[ beer ]	 I ordered several drinks at this establishment and it was never clear to me what the beer selections were
FOOD	[ O  ]	Regardless, the bartenders seemed friendly enough and it was a fun place for a show

FOOD	[ O  ]	I've had some decent experiences here throughout my life
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Many friends work there etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good neighborhood spot
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Solid 7/10 bar food that won't blow your mind
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Some servers and bartenders are nicer than others
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Also this place has some good live music and is somewhat famous for blues acts
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's a good place to go if you live in the hood but I would skip if if you are visiting
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would go here all of the time when my boyfriend was at UW
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So good, smells like an old bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A real old fashioned wooden bar soaked in booze
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I love it
FOOD	[ walnut ]	Has a pool table and most of all the 5 star rating is for the walnut burger
FOOD	[ meat ]	 I use to be a vegetarian and I would dream about eating that thing, better than meat any day of the week
FOOD	[ O  ]	I use to use to
FOOD	[ walnut, blue cheese, chips ]	Good times :)I had a walnut burger coupled with your hot blue cheese chips
FOOD	[ O  ]	it was ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is a classic Wisconsin Tavern and I enjoyed watching football at the Harmony
FOOD	[ O  ]	 No bullshit here
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is absolutely horrible
FOOD	[ O  ]	The staff is rude and acts put out by your mere presence!Ventured in to the Harmony to celebrate the closing of my new house; turns out it's located about 1
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 blocks from my new pad, so I have a feeling I'll be getting more familiar with The Harmony
FOOD	[ O  ]	What a cool place
FOOD	[ cover charge ]	Awesome bar, plenty of seating, live music (although with a cover charge
FOOD	[ beer ]	boo), great beer selection, and really solid food
FOOD	[ cheeseburger ]	I tried the classic cheeseburger; patties were hand-formed and cooked to a perfect medium
FOOD	[ Cheese, curds ]	Cheese curds came from a bag, but were some of the better ones I've ever tried
FOOD	[ chips ]	The house-made pub chips were excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	A small group of us ate and drank for a few hours; the total tab came to just over $60, which is an absolute bargain
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was prompt and efficient, making for a great overall experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll be back (a lot)!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh, and check out the daily food specials - looks like they have some inventive and interesting options!Great local place in the Atwood neighborhood
FOOD	[ pretzels ]	Pizzas are amazing, as are the pretzels
FOOD	[ O  ]	Keith and staff do a great job
FOOD	[ O  ]	Plenty of local brews on tap
FOOD	[ walnut, flavor ]	I'm truly a carnivore at heart, but the walnut burger at The Harmony is quite spectacular & totally unique - great flavor, great texture and totally satisfying
FOOD	[ chips, blue cheese, dip ]	Paired with a side of hot chips & blue cheese dip, you've got a delicious and memorable meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is my neighborhood bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is dependable and predictable
FOOD	[ chicken, breast, noodles ]	My favorite dish is the chicken breast plate with the Asian noodles
FOOD	[ chicken ]	The chicken is moist and flavorful every time
FOOD	[ chips, blue cheese ]	I love their homemade chips with blue cheese but I try to steer clear
FOOD	[ O  ]	I always pray that someone else at the table will order them and I can sneak a few 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Stolen food has no calories
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is one of those places that you  feel welcome and relaxed as soon as you get there
FOOD	[ walnut, beef ]	I enjoy the food, the walnut burger was super different and interesting, and although I prefer the beef it was fun to try something different
FOOD	[ O  ]	The rest of the food was as good as bar food gets, but the staff and general feel of the bar (I love the old school jukebox!) makes it 5 stars for me
FOOD	[ O  ]	First rate bar food, better than many restaurants and priced right
FOOD	[ O  ]	You cant go wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	Under new ownership but this hasn't affected quality
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great blues bar too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good bar food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cash only 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seat yourself first come first sere
FOOD	[ walnut, chips, blue cheese, dips ]	The walnut burger was decent and had the warm chips and blue cheese dips was not bad 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very cozy place with banquet style seating
FOOD	[ Beer ]	Beer selection is ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good room for seeing bands - sound was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, majority of the male staff here is unapologetically rude & disrespectful
FOOD	[ O  ]	Aging sports neanderthals that could care less that you're there
FOOD	[ O  ]	Don't waste your time - spend your money at Mickey's Tavern or Crystal Corner instead
FOOD	[ Walnut ]	I've been to the Harmony several times before, but last night was the first time I've been there for live music, and also the first time I tried their famed Walnut Burger
FOOD	[ O  ]	First, you should know that the Harmony is indeed a bar
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you go expecting an upscale "gastro-pub" experience of chic bar food, then you will be disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are no waiters, and you seat yourself
FOOD	[ O  ]	You order food and drinks at the bar, and  a food runner brings out your order when it's ready
FOOD	[ O  ]	Its got a dive bar atmosphere, and the interior is pretty run down
FOOD	[ O  ]	After fighting for a table due to the crowd that was rapidly accumulating in anticipation of that evening's band, my friends and I perused the menu
FOOD	[ fries, onion rings ]	It contains primarily stereotypical bar food (burgers, fries, onion rings, etc), but there are a few exceptions
FOOD	[ nachos, meat ]	There are several vegetarian options, including veggie nachos, so if you're a non meat eater, you would probably find lots of things to order at The Harmony
FOOD	[ walnut ]	Most notably, The Harmony offers a walnut burger
FOOD	[ walnut, blue cheese, potato, chips, Bleu Cheese, Dip ]	I'm told they're famous for it, so I ordered the walnut burger with blue cheese and a side of homemade potato chips with "Bleu Cheese Dip"
FOOD	[ Blue Cheese, beer ]	(What can I say, I really, really love Blue Cheese!) It took awhile for the food to come out, so we drank beer while we waited
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our table of about 10 people ordered 3 pitchers to share
FOOD	[ O  ]	I am not sure what all of them were, but in honor of the WI bar experience, I stuck to PBR
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was as good as PBR can be
FOOD	[ blue cheese, walnut, blue cheese, blue cheese, blue cheese ]	Onto the food: The blue cheese walnut burger came topped with a creamy blue cheese sauce in addition to blue cheese crumbles, rather than plain blue cheese crumbles like I had been anticipating
FOOD	[ onion, lettuce, tomato, mayo ]	It also came with onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayo
FOOD	[ lettuce, tomato ]	The lettuce and tomato were exceptionally fresh and ripe looking
FOOD	[ tomato ]	I was really impressed, especially by the tomato (it was actually red!)
FOOD	[ blue cheese ]	I bit into it and was immediately transported to blue cheese heaven
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was fantastic
FOOD	[ blue cheese, flavor ]	I will qualify this praise with the statement that the reason I loved this burger so much was largely a result of the copious blue cheese flavor
FOOD	[ walnut ]	I am not sure the walnut burger itself was why it tasted so great
FOOD	[ chips ]	The chips were also awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	They arrived piping hot
FOOD	[ O  ]	Some were crunchy and others were chewier
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was clear that they were made to order
FOOD	[ Bleu Cheese, Dip ]	The Bleu Cheese Dip they came with was similar to what came on my burger, and as a result, was amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	We ate as the band played and just reveled in how fun the whole experience was
FOOD	[ O  ]	By the way, the band was great! It was a Rockabilly group called The Fast Clydes
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you like that style of music, I couldn't recommend them more
FOOD	[ O  ]	They had a ton of energy and knew how to work the crowd
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had a blast
FOOD	[ O  ]	All this said, there are a few things that I think The Harmony could improve upon
FOOD	[ O  ]	First off, the tables in the main dining area are plastic
FOOD	[ beer ]	They're the exact same tables that you played beer pong on in college
FOOD	[ O  ]	I feel like The Harmony excels in spite of its dive bar atmosphere, and not necessarily because of it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Therefore, if they invested just a little bit of money to spruce up the interior, I think they would see a return
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Atwood area is still rocking that hippie vibe, for sure, but more and more, I am noticing newer and more upscale establishments
FOOD	[ O  ]	To me, that says that there's probably a market for it and the times, they are a changin'
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also, I don't mind ordering food and drinks at the bar
FOOD	[ table service ]	However, I think The Harmony would benefit from offering table service, at least during shows on Friday and Saturday night
FOOD	[ conversation, beer ]	I have only ever been to The Harmony with a group, and it sucks to have to walk away from the conversation to get another beer, a process which can take 10 or 15 minutes if it's crowded
FOOD	[ O  ]	All-in-all, these drawbacks are minor, and I'll be back at The Harmony many times this summer!It's been nearly a year since I've become somewhat of a "regular" here, so it's probably time for an update
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ New ownership/management, effective sometime late last year
FOOD	[ O  ]	+ Same 'ole Harmony - big bar, plenty of seating, plenty of televisions
FOOD	[ Cow ]	+ Decent tap list, ever-changing, although staples remain constant (Cow, PBR, Bells)
FOOD	[ Appetizers ]	+ Appetizers are where it's at here
FOOD	[ chips, curds ]	Pub chips, curds, etc - all are very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Specials are hit-or-miss; some are great, some are a bit less than great
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Pizzas; I'm not a huge fan of them
FOOD	[ cheese ]	Too much cheese, sweet sauce, and just not super stellar
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pricey, to boot
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Last visit was a bit funky, quite literally
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was quite sultry inside; as if the A/C wasn't on, or couldn't keep up
FOOD	[ O  ]	Then the Harmony's softball team arrived, fresh from an evening of playing
FOOD	[ O  ]	and the place started to funk-up, odor-wise
FOOD	[ O  ]	Adding insult to injury, the bar staff and kitchen became overwhelmed
FOOD	[ O  ]	I sort of agree with Chopper C's assessment of the male bartenders - they're quite surly and often seem very perterbed, especially when the place is busy like it was earlier this week
FOOD	[ chips ]	+ Pub chips were great, as usual
FOOD	[ salmon, salad, salmon ]	+ Marinated salmon Cesar salad was good; salmon a bit over-cooked and grey, but still tasty
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	+ Whitehouse Smoked Turkey sandwich was outstanding
FOOD	[ O  ]	- Cash only
FOOD	[ Fish ]	- No Fish Fry on Fridays
FOOD	[ pizza ]	- Odd hours/conditions around pizza availabilityGrade: D
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yeah, I order my martinis served on the rocks and in goblets
FOOD	[ O  ]	Duh
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great food and service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Thanks
FOOD	[ O  ]	I stayed away from this chain for years, but after a business trip forced me into their doors multiple nights, I gave my home location another chance
FOOD	[ tacos ]	The food is predictable but getting more adventurous over the years, and the korean tacos are pretty exotic
FOOD	[ appetizer, potatoes, salad ]	I try not to eat here without looking at the nutritional information in advance; the one time I didn't, I ate half an appetizer (loaded baked potatoes) and a salad and found out that was 2100 calories
FOOD	[ O  ]	There were also pretty substantial delays in service
FOOD	[ O  ]	My other half dozen visits have had excellent service and well prepared food
FOOD	[ New Year ]	Maybe the staff wasn't at its best because they were here on New Year's Eve?
FOOD	[ tequila ]	Though I seldom use it, they have a very nice drink list, especially if you're a fan of tequila
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's also one of the few restaurants I know that offers reward points for eating there
FOOD	[ O  ]	All in all, I choose to go here for a standard night out with people who can't agree on what they want to eat
FOOD	[ tacos ]	The Korean tacos are not half bad, and the kid really likes the burgers
FOOD	[ O  ]	My boyfriend and I went here because we had a $25 gift card and thought we'd get a cheap meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	Too bad TGI Fridays is incredibly overpriced
FOOD	[ hamburger, pasta ]	Maybe it's my own fault for choosing something besides a hamburger, but the pasta dinner I ordered was just awful
FOOD	[ mushrooms ]	It was clearly a frozen meal they just heated up (I asked for no mushrooms and they told me it wasn't possible)
FOOD	[ O  ]	I know many restaurants do this, but when I get a $50 bill for food I could have heated up at home it doesn't make me happy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Might as well go to Denny's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Same quality food, way better price
FOOD	[ O  ]	I only like this TGIFriday's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Their service is very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have never had to wait more then 10 minutes to get a table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food there is very good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Always consistent
FOOD	[ Sirloin ]	 I always usually order their House Sirloin-10oz
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is always juicy and flavorful
FOOD	[ sodas ]	 They always keep sodas and other drinks full and their manager always checks on you to make sure that your experience is a good one
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Keep up the good work!!!Great food!  Prices are very reasonable for the amount you get
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	 Always very busy when I've been in, yet service is still great!Great little BBQ joint on the north end of Madison - emphasis on little
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place has perhaps a dozen tables, most only able to seat two
FOOD	[ O  ]	The decorating scheme is similar to a log cabin, with varnished wood walls and ceiling, and red checkered table clothes on the tables
FOOD	[ aroma ]	The food is wonderful - the smoky aroma hits you as soon as you walk in the door
FOOD	[ rack ]	The half rack was delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sauce is a traditional red, tangy and a little sweet
FOOD	[ pulled pork, sandwich ]	They also serve the sauce on the side if you order a pulled pork sandwich, which is nice
FOOD	[ BBQ, BBQ ]	I've had BBQ across this great land of ours from Austin to Dallas to NYC to LA to St Louis to New Orleans and places in between and I'm gonna share a secret with you - Smoky Jon's is the best BBQ I've ever had
FOOD	[ pulled pork ]	 The ribs and pulled pork are the most tender, perfectly smoky and best tasting i've had
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'm not an evangelist for dry rub or wet rub or combo - all I want is good tasting grub
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The sauce here is delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The sides here are also some of the best
FOOD	[ baked beans, pork ]	 The baked beans have little pieces of pork in em and are super tasty
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're going to the airport its right by the entrance - make a quick stop and you won't be disappointed
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	FYI - Jon of Smokey Jon's has won BBQ competitions all over the US
FOOD	[ BBQ, grill ]	 His BBQ grill is a huge pink pig that he hauls on the back of his truck to competitions
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Jon also is a huge big nice looking man
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	 He knows his BBQ probably from first hand experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	As this is LITERALLY my favorite restaurant, I can't believe it's taken me until now to review it
FOOD	[ bottle ]	 I carry a bottle of Smoky Jon's sauce with me when I go to other places to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That's how good it is
FOOD	[ pulled pork, brisket, sandwiches ]	 The pulled pork and brisket sandwiches are excellent
FOOD	[ pulled pork, sandwich, fries, corn ]	 I can put down a 1/3 slab of ribs, a pulled pork sandwich and their super-excellent fries with a side of corn like it's nothing
FOOD	[ O  ]	My only small gripe is that sometimes, after about 7:00 PM (they close at 9), the ribs seem like they can be a little over-done
FOOD	[ O  ]	 (Not as tender)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Smoky Jon's turns me into a pig, and I love every delicious mouthful
FOOD	[ O  ]	Went here tonight based on Yelp reviews!
FOOD	[ O  ]	What a great find! I drove by this place on my way to work for a YEAR and never thought to stop in
FOOD	[ O  ]	At a glance, it doesn't seem like much
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nestled(snugly) between two other buildings you can almost miss it
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	I'm so glad we stopped in! It has that true BBQ joint atmosphere- checkered cloth tables(each complete with it's own roll of paper towels), wood paneling, and Southern blues playing overhead
FOOD	[ O  ]	You order at the counter off of a big overhead wood sign, and they bring piles of saucy goodness to your table
FOOD	[ barbecue ]	This place is littered with awards for their barbecue
FOOD	[ cook ]	I guess the owner travels and competes(and a lot of times, wins) at national cook-offs
FOOD	[ beef, brisket ]	I got the 1/3 slab rib and beef brisket combo
FOOD	[ O  ]	The ribs were super yummy
FOOD	[ Flavor ]	Flavor-full, but not too smokey
FOOD	[ brisket, fatty ]	The brisket was nice too, not too fatty
FOOD	[ vinegar, tang ]	I would say that the house sauce has that vinegar-like tang
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's sweet and spicy and tart all at the same time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	My saucy side dish(aka boyfriend) ordered the turkey, which we both thought was good
FOOD	[ O  ]	but nothing amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sides were really tasty too
FOOD	[ beans, sugar, dough, confectioners' sugar ]	The beans were delish, and the sugar-buns(read: fried dough dusted with confectioners' sugar) weren't too bad either
FOOD	[ O  ]	We both left with tingling tongues, full bellies, and smiles on our faces
FOOD	[ O  ]	* just a note--parking in the "lot" is super sparse and hard to navigate in and out of
FOOD	[ rack ]	the only drawback!Smoky Jon's rack o' ribs puts all other rib places, and places that serve ribs to shame
FOOD	[ meat ]	 The portions are ginormous and the meat is tender
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The sauce that's slathered everywhere is spicy, tangy, sweet but not disgustingly so, and smokey
FOOD	[ meat, BBQ ]	It reminds me of sitting around a campfire roasting some damn fine meat, slathering it up in top notch BBQ sauce and then grubbin' happily
FOOD	[ baked beans, garlic, mashed potatoes ]	For sides we had baked beans, garlic mashed potatoes and dinner rolls
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However after stuffing ourselves with tons of ribs there was no room for the sides! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	We ordered out because the dining area in Smoky Jon's is teeny tiny and the parking lot is even worse
FOOD	[ O  ]	Truly, my only complaint was that I spent all night in the bathroom after eating here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I think that's because my system was just not prepared for the rich, smokey, deliciousness that I have never experienced before
FOOD	[ BBQ, bbq ]	So it was worth it!  YAY!!!BBQ: Great! Picture on the outside of the building of a pig eating his own ribs: Disturbing!Thank God! When I was an undergrad in Madison back in 96, we scoured the city in search of decent bbq to no avail
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm moving back in August and now know at least 3 places where I will be dining in that first week
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is one of them and I look forward to it
FOOD	[ O  ]	It just unfortunate that it's on a street named after the Packers
FOOD	[ O  ]	boo
FOOD	[ bbq ]	Go Bears ;)Small little joint, good bbq, fast in, eat, fast out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Staff is super helpful when my party couldn't decide what we wanted
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service was fast and packaged quite well (take out)
FOOD	[ Barbecue, pork ]	Barbecue pork shoulder was good, ribs were great, buns were good
FOOD	[ coleslaw, potato salad, fries, beans, beans ]	 Something wasn't quite right with the sides though, we had coleslaw, potato salad, fries and beans (though I didn't try the beans) and while they were good, they were underseasoned and just missing something
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall a very satisfying experience and I would definitely go back!Yeah, for realz
FOOD	[ O  ]	all the awards, accolades, etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	, are spot on
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best ribs I can remember having in a very, very, very long time - perhaps ever
FOOD	[ jerky ]	I especially liked the end portions of the slab that somehow dodged the sauce and were on the  tougher side (think jerky)
FOOD	[ O  ]	That alone was fantastic
FOOD	[ Cookie ]	Unfortunately, much like the Cookie Monster now says that cookies are sometimes food, these delicious ribs are sometimes food too
FOOD	[ Cookie, BBQ ]	Every now and then though, I might have my Cookie Monster moment where sometimes is NOW!I'm not a die hard BBQ fan nor do I normally spring for it when I'm hungry but after eating here I may change my tune
FOOD	[ meat, bone, pulled pork, sandwich ]	The ribs are amzaing, the meat practically falls off the bone and is so tender!! The pulled pork sandwich is equally delicious and the serving size is more than generous
FOOD	[ sugar, baked beans, fries ]	The sweet bisquits are a nice way to end the meal, served piping hot and covered in powdered sugar; although ordering them serperate is recommended as the baked beans and fries are a must have!!I may be a little biased since I've grown up on these ribs but damn it if these aren't great ribs I have no clue what are
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Got off the plane and the first thing on my mind is ribs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's right next to the airport
FOOD	[ pork, bucks ]	 Even if you are there for a layover just take a cab up the street and get yourself a full slab of pork ribs with two sides for only 20 bucks
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That's enough food for 3 people folks
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you ain't keen on sharing with your nasty, always sick, finger licking companion(s) then they have individual meals too
FOOD	[ meat, bone ]	 The meat is fall off the bone tender and juicy
FOOD	[ bbq, sauces ]	 The bbq sauce is what I judge other sauces by
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 It's vinegary and a little sweet and a whole lot of flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you are in Madison and you  crave ribs then this is the only place you should think of
FOOD	[ O  ]	mmmm
FOOD	[ O  ]	eerrrr
FOOD	[ barbeque ]	this is not real barbeque
FOOD	[ meat, bone, flavor, meat ]	 The ribs don't taste bad, but they aren't cooked slow enough, because the meat doesn't fall off the bone and all the flavor comes from the sauce that's slathered on it, not the actual meat
FOOD	[ meat, liquid ]	 The turkey was a insult to the art of barbecuing -- it tasted like deli meat that had been sprayed with liquid smoke
FOOD	[ MEAT, onion, base, tang ]	BEST SWEET MEAT IN MADISON! The sauce is unique and fantastic with tiny onion pieces in it contributing a bite to the sweetness of the base with it's slight tang
FOOD	[ meat, bone ]	The meat is prepared exactly how you'd expect--falling off the bone with a slight resistance
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd kill for these ribs! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm serious
FOOD	[ O  ]	For take out, I find the ribs to be a little under sauced
FOOD	[ bottle ]	I bought a bottle of Smoky Jon's Sauce to take home to load up the ribs
FOOD	[ O  ]	After hearing that this place was the bees knees from many friends and reviews, I decided to take a small group of friends and give it the test
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	 Afterwards I was impressed and absolutely full, but I wouldn't give it the BBQ crown
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think most of the value here comes from its uniqueness
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	 Smoky Jon's sits in a small little log-cabin-style shack, and when you walk in you are witness to the plethora of awards they have received from their delicious BBQ fixins
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Soon, you'll discover their own personal sauce (which I hope you slather across your food), and a menu that has item descriptions which make you want to grow a second stomach
FOOD	[ Corn bread, beans, brisket, pulled pork ]	 Corn bread, beans, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, etc; all the delectable food you'd expect from a place like this
FOOD	[ brisket, corn bread ]	 I personally had ribs and brisket with corn bread, and I ate every last bite with no regrets
FOOD	[ Barbecue ]	Problem is, I've had some really good Barbecue in my life, and the overall taste of the food, while good, wasn't great in comparison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Some of the places I've dined at in Kansas City, for instance, were a step up from this
FOOD	[ dishes ]	 Even some of the dishes at Famous Daves could rival Smoky Jon's, although the ribs certainly could not
FOOD	[ O  ]	The rest of my party all had mixed responses
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 My girlfriend didn't really care for what she ordered (I can't remember what it was, a sandwich of some sort), and several of them didn't like the smallishness of the place or the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The lady was OK, but she was behind the counter mostly and didn't do much to make us feel welcome
FOOD	[ O  ]	 When we walked in we were all really excited to be there and try it, and she was just kind of "meh
FOOD	[ O  ]	"  Also, the location is probably the least desirable of any restaurant I've been to in Madison, but that's more relative to where you live or how you feel about certain neighborhoods
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, worth a try and probably one of the better BBQs as far as Madison goes
FOOD	[ O  ]	 While it doesn't get the full star ride from me, I can see why others give it high praise
FOOD	[ O  ]	Me and my boyfriend were driving from the dells back to Illinois and we were getting hungry for lunch
FOOD	[ fast food ]	 We decided to skip all the fast food chains you can get anywhere and decided to let yelp tell u where to eat
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We searched high ratings in Madison and we stumbled upon Smoky Jon's
FOOD	[ O  ]	It did not disappoint
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was also conviently located close to the highway
FOOD	[ brisket, sandwich ]	We ordered the ribs and brisket sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	The best part is the sauce
FOOD	[ bottle ]	I wish I brought home a bottle of sauce
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	I will definately go back if I'm ever in Madison again!!This place is running on the fact that there really is no good BBQ in Madison
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	And Smoky Jon, if that is his real name, may have won a lot of awards, but he is not selling that winning BBQ at this location
FOOD	[ O  ]	I got off a plane starving after a long business weekend and I could not eat the ribs that were served because the tips were burnt and more like chewing tobacco than ribs
FOOD	[ recipes ]	I wouldn't mention the sides because that is not why you go to these places, but Jon you need to get off the beach in Cancun and work on these recipes, they ST-I-N-K
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Smoky Jon's is some of the best BBQ I've had in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, I haven't tried many places, so that's not saying much
FOOD	[ pork, sandwich ]	 I really enjoy the ribs and the pork shoulder sandwich
FOOD	[ brisket ]	 The brisket is good as well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I have found all the barbecued menu items to be flavorful and tender
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The burgers aren't that good, however; they're overdone and greasy
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sides also leave something to be desired
FOOD	[ biscuits ]	 I've never had a bad side dish, but I've only really been impressed by the fried biscuits
FOOD	[ mashed potatoes ]	 The mashed potatoes are runner-up
FOOD	[ pasta salad, potato salad ]	 The pasta salad and potato salad are both well below average
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service at Smoky Jon's is both quick and friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Employees will remember you, which is always nice
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The prices are good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The location is a little iffy, though; the parking lot is too small and the building itself can feel cramped
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	All problems aside, I will keep coming here for the delicious BBQ
FOOD	[ BBQ, flavor ]	I've had BBQ all over the country but the sauce here is my kind of flavor
FOOD	[ meat ]	The meat is so tender and juicy it hardly needs sauce, but the sauce is so good I have to get an extra cup on the side! All the sides are tasty so you can't go wrong there
FOOD	[ sugar, biscuits ]	"Forrest, what's going on with them damn sugar fried biscuits!" Yes, that is what I literally heard there
FOOD	[ O  ]	This was followed by a refund on some of our meal-more on that later
FOOD	[ O  ]	My friend is a UW student and after deciding to visit him he took us here to eat
FOOD	[ brisket, chicken ]	We ordered the brisket, rib and chicken
FOOD	[ brisket, onions ]	The brisket was cut, almost chipped with a tangy/sweet sauce with a little bit of a bite at the end and little bits of onions that were chewy/crunchy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I asked the person taking my order about his recommendations for sides
FOOD	[ fries, baked beans ]	He said-definitely the fries and the baked beans
FOOD	[ baked beans ]	The baked beans were delicious! Also sweet with a little kick at the end and then with a little sweetness to it
FOOD	[ beans, lard, butter ]	I just want to take the time right now to say that I hate beans-the consistency of it and the way that they're often overloaded with lard/butter
FOOD	[ O  ]	As mentioned above, yummy and on top of that he said that if I didn't like either of the sides he recommended to let him know and he would get me something else
FOOD	[ O  ]	I tried the ribs which were so soft that it basically came apart in my fingers, the sauce was consistent throughout
FOOD	[ doughnuts, sugar, biscuits ]	My friend placed an order of the 'doughnuts' as he called it but they were sugar fried biscuits
FOOD	[ O  ]	We waited and waited, ordered them to-go and even then they weren't ready
FOOD	[ sugar, biscuits, biscuits ]	The counter-man, who must have been the manager then asked the unseen Forrest what was going on with the damn sugar fried biscuits and then said he was going to give back the money for the biscuits
FOOD	[ O  ]	That's really an extra step in fixing a slight problem in an otherwise small kink
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	BBQ Sauce is spectacular
FOOD	[ cups, beer, BBQ, beer ]	 But the restaurant is horrible -- uncomfortable dining room, prices way too high to be a no-service, order at the counter place, sides are minuscule in tiny cups, and there's no bar, not even beer!  What's BBQ without beer to go with it?  
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices are way over the top for Madison
FOOD	[ pulled pork, bottle, BBQ ]	Stop by for some takeout pulled pork, or buy a bottle of exceptional BBQ sauce and do it yourself at home
FOOD	[ O  ]	Amazing ribs and sauce
FOOD	[ chicken ]	The chicken is pretty good, too
FOOD	[ O  ]	Problems are: 
FOOD	[ mashed potatoes ]	-Small, relatively unimpressive sides (those mashed potatoes are definitely instant)
FOOD	[ a la carte ]	-They charge you for sharing! Even when my boyfriend and I were ordering take-out a la carte ribs on the phone, they asked him if he would be sharing with anyone so they could tack-on that extra $1
FOOD	[ O  ]	50! What's up with that?
FOOD	[ beer ]	-The dine-in experience (like many have already posted) isn't great, since it's so small and there's no beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	All that said, Smoky Jon's has the best ribs in town
FOOD	[ O  ]	Trust me, I've tried every rib spot in Madison
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Best BBQ in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Hands down
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Only loses a star for consistently messing up take-out orders and not being up to par compared to places in the south
FOOD	[ rack, beans, Apple sauce ]	Wtf!!! Superb!!!! 1/2 rack w beans and Apple sauce!! In Wisconsin!! No wonder they won all the awards!! Ask for the G
FOOD	[ O  ]	D's!! Wish they had this in Cali!Wow
FOOD	[ beef, brisket ]	Best beef brisket I've had in my life
FOOD	[ O  ]	Awesome, awesome ribs
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	I love BBQ and this place is the real deal
FOOD	[ glass ]	When I saw the "no 1" in the name of the restaurant I laughed because that's a tall glass to fill and I was prepared to tear them down on Yelp if it wasn't true, but they blew me and my taste buds away
FOOD	[ O  ]	I could go on, but let me put it this way: Next Monday I'm flying into Madison for work for what will likely be my last trip to WI for a while
FOOD	[ O  ]	My coworkers and I have already agreed that we're driving straight from the airport to get lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	Now I just need to decide
FOOD	[ brisket ]	ribs or brisket?
FOOD	[ brisket, brisket, sandwich ]	(Note, I went twice so that I could have both the ribs AND the brisket :) )I had the brisket sandwich, he had the ribs
FOOD	[ Brisket, fatty, bbq ]	Brisket was a little fatty, but I loved the bbq sauce
FOOD	[ Baked beans, BBQ, BBQ ]	Baked beans were delicious!I take my BBQ seriously and because of that I researched on-line via Yelp and other sites various reviews of BBQ places in Madison, finally deciding on Smoky Jon's No 1 B-B-Q
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab
FOOD	[ choice, pork, sandwich, brisket, sandwich, pork, sandwich ]	 Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I then arrived about a half hour later
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They had given my order to the man before me and I had his
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Apparently we both had the same first name
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So the counter lady tells me she'll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64
FOOD	[ pork, sandwich, dough ]	66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Should have been 1/2 that
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I told her and she couldn't understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Now I was getting irritated
FOOD	[ bucks ]	 She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon
FOOD	[ O  ]	So I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab
FOOD	[ O  ]	 From the first taste I was not impressed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don't get it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Almost every other place I've eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place
FOOD	[ sugar, biscuits ]	 The "sugar-fried" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again)
FOOD	[ fries, BBQ ]	 The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far
FOOD	[ corn ]	 The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe
FOOD	[ pork, sandwich, containers, sandwich, pork ]	 So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn't look like pork either
FOOD	[ chicken, fries, mashed potatoes ]	 I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included
FOOD	[ beans, apple sauce, BBQ, bottle ]	 Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn't need since I bought a whole bottle
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect
FOOD	[ chicken ]	 And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either
FOOD	[ bucks ]	 I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	I strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you'll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I'll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh well
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Great BBQ!
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	It's a little out of the way, but worth the journey if you're looking for decent BBQ
FOOD	[ O  ]	I don't remember seeing any highchairs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We ended up bringing in our stroller for our daughter to sit in
FOOD	[ O  ]	While you have to order your food at the counter, there is a wait staff that will bring your food to you and refill your drinks
FOOD	[ beverages ]	No alcoholic beverages
FOOD	[ O  ]	(that's why 4 stars)
FOOD	[ corn, fries ]	Love the sauce, corn, fries, everything I've tried!Finally got to Smoky Jon's for the first time yesterday
FOOD	[ brisket, sandwich, flip, BBQ ]	The brisket sandwich was delicious and I am pretty sure I would eat a flip-flop if it was drenched in their BBQ sauce
FOOD	[ pork ]	Looking forward to going back for the ribs and chopped pork
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ribs were good, but sauce was a little too sweet
FOOD	[ corn, margarine ]	 Review was so close to 4 stars but the corn was cooked in margarine
FOOD	[ Margarine ]	Really?  Margarine?  C'mon you're in Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	We tried to go to this place on a Monday; oops, not open
FOOD	[ O  ]	After 10 months of living in the Madison area, we have found THE RIB PLACE
FOOD	[ brisket, corn, beans ]	The ribs are great, so is the brisket, the corn, beans
FOOD	[ O  ]	you get the idea
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant is a little small but the service was amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Watching my family eat was almost as good as the food, almost
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	I highly recommend Smoky Jon's #1 BBQ
FOOD	[ pork, sugar, biscuits, garlic, mashed potatoes ]	1/2 slab and pork shoulder with sugar fried biscuits and garlic mashed potatoes
FOOD	[ O  ]	We need one of these in Philadelphia
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	The BBQ was so tender and flavorful
FOOD	[ meat ]	 Sides were good but not as amazing as the meat
FOOD	[ brisket ]	Will definitely be back to try the brisket before I head back east
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant itself is small and cramped but the food is worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Long story short
FOOD	[ Pork ]	Pork ribs are amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've had ribs all over the US and the ones here compare favorably with all of them
FOOD	[ meat, flavor ]	The meat falls off of the bones and have a smoky flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sauce is also quite tasty with a tinge of spices
FOOD	[ beef, brisket, pork ]	The beef brisket and pork shoulder are fairly average
FOOD	[ bbq ]	This is pretty good bbq for madison, but that doesn't say that much
FOOD	[ O  ]	I haven't been everywhere in town, but honestly I think Famous Dave's is better
FOOD	[ bbq ]	Basically its decent food, but if you've had real bbq somewhere like memphis, kansas city, st
FOOD	[ O  ]	louis, or anywhere south of wisconsin,  you will be disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	Well this is a tough one
FOOD	[ O  ]	A few years back, I stopped going to SJ'sbecause I was sick of getting rubbery non tender ribs
FOOD	[ O  ]	In the 90's, you could always count on getting the BEST ribs around, EVERY time
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think that the fact that Jon worked there then made the difference
FOOD	[ O  ]	Since he retired, I dont know what happened exactly? However, recently I stopped in for a shoulder platter, and everything was great, so go figure
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sauce is fantastic, and when done well, this place is something special
FOOD	[ O  ]	Went here with a couple of friends after work one night
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	 We 'd been looking for a good BBQ place in Madison, and Smoky Jon's was the first place we tried
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Needless to say, we won't be trying any place else!
FOOD	[ O  ]	The first thing that struck me was the great atmosphere in the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's a small place, maybe 15 tables total, and there's blues music playing in the background
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We grabbed a couple of tables and didn't have to wait very long before our food was brought out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh was the food good
FOOD	[ pulled pork, sandwich ]	 I ordered a 1/3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter
FOOD	[ pork, bun ]	 The pork was piled on it's bun in plentiful quantities
FOOD	[ pork, flavor ]	 It was pretty good, the pork had good flavor and my only complaint is that it wasn't quite as tender and juicy as some of the homemade stuff I've had
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The ribs, though, were amazing
FOOD	[ meat ]	 The meat was incredibly tender
FOOD	[ meat, bone ]	 More importantly, though, was that there was a lot of meat on each bone
FOOD	[ rack ]	 I'm used to seeing skimpy ribs get served at restaurants where you're left wanting more after a full rack
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Here, in just 4 bones I found I was very full
FOOD	[ meat ]	 Smoky Jon's sauce was a great compliment to the meat as well
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 Good full flavor with a nice little kick at the end
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sides were equally excellent
FOOD	[ baked beans, flavor ]	 The baked beans are a must, and I saved mine for the end so that's the flavor I would leave with
FOOD	[ sugar, biscuits ]	 I also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty good too
FOOD	[ O  ]	The highlight of the meal, though, was something one of my friends had ordered
FOOD	[ chili ]	 The restaurant also had chili available (which may just be a seasonal item)
FOOD	[ fork ]	 It was served with a fork rather than a spoon, and with good reason
FOOD	[ chili ]	 I've never seen chili that was that thick and meaty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was able to get a taste of it and was floored by how great the flavors were
FOOD	[ chili ]	 It was so good that I almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Smoky Jon's is a must for BBQ fans in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The prices are good, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We will be going back sooner rather than later
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	It gets 4 stars for being great BBQ AND being this far in Yankee country
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'd probably rate it at 3
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars if I could so that my scores relative to this one would make more sense overall
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But I digress
FOOD	[ brisket, sandwich, corn, baked beans ]	I ordered the ribs and a brisket sandwich with the spicy corn and the baked beans for dinner about two weeks ago
FOOD	[ O  ]	The verdicts:
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ribs = VERY well done
FOOD	[ bone ]	 Tender, pull-off-the-bone and delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The sauce is where you get the refinement too (beyond the smoking process of course, which is an art in itself)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There are a lot of flavors going on in the sauce and it's not overdone in terms of application
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	 I've eaten BBQ everywhere and this place's ribs stand up with anyone's
FOOD	[ Brisket, Sandwich ]	Brisket Sandwich = Boring
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was told what I was ordering, so kudos to the service because they were dead on
FOOD	[ sandwich, brisket ]	 It was less of a sandwich and more of brisket on a plain roll
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 That's fine of course, but for some reason I feel like sandwich doesn't describe this well
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	 It does remind me of the bare minimum approach you find in many BBQ joints around, but I don't like it there either
FOOD	[ brisket ]	 Anyway, the brisket was very tasty and you should just order it on its own
FOOD	[ bread, BBQ ]	 No point in getting a piece of bread that just hides the taste of good BBQ
FOOD	[ Corn ]	Spicy Corn = Awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Truly delicious stuff, and I plowed through it in 30 seconds
FOOD	[ spice ]	 Perfect amount of spice too
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Wish I had a little more in that serving, but it will bring me back
FOOD	[ O  ]	soooo mission accomplished?
FOOD	[ Baked Beans ]	Baked Beans = Awesome
FOOD	[ baked beans ]	 I asked if they were made in house, I was told that they were and my palate was rewarded with some of the finest baked beans one can find
FOOD	[ pasty, flavor ]	 Thick, almost pasty (in a good way) and chock full of flavor
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only downfalls would be that it's somewhat pricey for what you get, but food is going up everywhere
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 I also ordered a sandwich combo, which was a mistake
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was top notch
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Everything and more was explained to me in detail
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 I only have myself to blame for trying that damn sandwich combo
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Please take it off of the menu
FOOD	[ O  ]	your customers are getting punished for ordering it and it takes away from what you do best
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	The decor is nice and very 'southern' in the sense that this is without a doubt a BBQ place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I liked looking over all of the trophies and reading the articles and seeing the old pictures
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very cool stuff
FOOD	[ O  ]	I got mine to go as well, which was quickly brought out to me
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Eating in looks like it would be fun
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	This is the best BBQ in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There are no challengers
FOOD	[ Caribou ]	 Comparing this to Famous Daves is like comparing a Caribou Burger to MacDonalds
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	 Not to say that MacDonalds/Famous Daves are necessarily BAD, but this is unique, delicious BBQ that wins best in Madison year in and year out for a reason
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The service is generally solid, and having travelled in rural LA a LOT, I can't believe anyone who frequents the southern Miss, Lousiana area to be surprised that a place is closed on Monday
FOOD	[ pork, sandwich ]	 The pork shoulder sandwich is the #1 item
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great Sauce
FOOD	[ baked beans ]	 Great baked beans
FOOD	[ pork, sandwich ]	 Great pork sandwich
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best in Madison
FOOD	[ Jesus ]	I now know what you get when you pray to baby Jesus
FOOD	[ O  ]	these ribs
FOOD	[ O  ]	SO GOOD!!!!!!!Famous Dave's is so much better!! I use to go here all the time when i was growing up and i loved it, i don't know what happened but there food really went down the drain
FOOD	[ fries ]	the ribs are dry and black on the bottom and the fries have way too much seasoning
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think Jon needs to get back in the kitchen instead of spending all his time at the bar next door
FOOD	[ bbq, BBQ ]	best bbq in madisonI've had BBQ in the Carolinas, St
FOOD	[ O  ]	Louis, and San Diego (Phil's), and I can honestly say that Smoky Jon's is the best I've ever had!!  It is a must have anytime you are near Madison
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	There is a reason this place has won awards for its BBQ
FOOD	[ O  ]	Excellent
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great service
FOOD	[ beef, brisket, pork ]	I just went here for the first time and wow I can't believe I have overlooked it for so many years!  We tried all the hot items, the beef brisket, pork shoulder, and the ribs
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd highly recommend all of them
FOOD	[ O  ]	Even if you are eating alone-you deserve it
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is America-Treat yo' self!
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	As a man who loves attending the local barbecues I can say this place is BBQ to the core
FOOD	[ barbecue ]	If you are serious about barbecue you best get over here
FOOD	[ O  ]	After one visit, I already plan to stop in or get takeout whenever I drive by the airport
FOOD	[ Barbecue ]	Side note: I love Famous Dave's Barbecue, but saying Smoky Jon's is inferior in anyway is laughable
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only reason I will ever again choose Famous Dave's over Smoky Jon's is because I am not in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Secondary note: you can pick up their sauce at Woodman's to put on everything
FOOD	[ O  ]	I love this place! I had them cater my wedding, had the Pig up and Go package delivered and set up
FOOD	[ BBQ, pork, beef ]	We had BBQ pork, beef, and turkey along with sides
FOOD	[ pork, beef, breast, meat ]	The only complaint I had was the turkey, I had assumed (and I know you should never assume!) it would be fresh, shredded turkey like the the pork and beef, but it was the processed, sliced turkey breast meat chopped up
FOOD	[ O  ]	That set aside, everything was delivered as scheduled, the employee who dropped the food off was very courteous and made sure to give us clear instructions on everything
FOOD	[ rack, chicken, meat, BBQ ]	We also visited here prior to our wedding and I shared the whole rack of ribs with my daughter and my husband had gotten the rotisserie chicken, the helpings were huge, the ribs were thick with meat and we did not leave hungry! Way better than Famous Dave's ribsSome of the best BBQ I have ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Found this place when I was looking for a place to grab dinner on a quick evening flight up from Chicago
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's super close to the airport and the food is outstanding
FOOD	[ O  ]	The ribs were the best I have ever had
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	The BBQ sauce is probably the best I have had
FOOD	[ O  ]	And everything is very smokey flavored, which, for me, is a very good thing
FOOD	[ chicken, brisket ]	I had a chance to also try the chicken (awesome) and brisket (decent, but not amazing)
FOOD	[ corn, French fries ]	For the sides, I got corn and the French fries
FOOD	[ fries, corn ]	This was surprising for me but the fries were average and the corn was unbelievable
FOOD	[ corn, corn ]	I pretty much assume corn is corn, but not here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finally, I liked the style of the place
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is a hole in the wall without man tables
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like that and recommend everyone to head there
FOOD	[ O  ]	The ribs, you must try them! My major mistake was getting a 1/3 slab
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very good food, would defiantly go back if i was in the area, not as a destination though
FOOD	[ barbeque ]	Smoky Jon's is absolutely the best barbeque joint in Madison, bar-none
FOOD	[ bone, brisket, barbeque ]	The ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender and cooked to perfection, but their brisket is a real treat - slightly smokey with a seasoning that compliments their barbeque sauce amazingly
FOOD	[ choice, barbeque, beans, coleslaw, Coleslaw ]	 Their meats are served with your choice of all the classic barbeque joint sides that you would expect - my favorites are the beans and the coleslaw, the latter of which is rich and creamy (not oily and bland like the "Creamy Coleslaw" at Brickhouse)
FOOD	[ BBQ, barbeque ]	I'm astounded by the reviewers who prefer the likes of  Brickhouse BBQ or Famous Dave's to Smoky Jon's and can only assume that they have never had real Kansas City or Texas barbeque
FOOD	[ barbeque ]	 If you want authentic barbeque, nothing beats Smoky Jon's
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Hands down the BEST BBQ IN MADISON! And yes, it was so good I had to use caps
FOOD	[ bone ]	The ribs are smothered in delicious sauce and fall right off the bone
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can pick your sides
FOOD	[ cole, slaw, french fries ]	I would recommend the cole slaw and french fries
FOOD	[ cole, slaw ]	The cole slaw is nice and creamy
FOOD	[ Mashed potatoes ]	Mashed potatoes are another solid pick
FOOD	[ O  ]	Always get the ribs
FOOD	[ pulled pork ]	You will be disappointed when your friends are gnawing away at their ribs and you have your little pulled pork sammie
FOOD	[ O  ]	The checkered tablecloths and roll of paper towels on each table complete the experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	My girlfriend talked me into giving this place one more chance so I said alright, my experience this time was a huge improvement from the last few times I was there
FOOD	[ fries, fries ]	I had the 1/2 slab of ribs with a double order of fries and my girlfriend had the same but with the fried buns and a single order of fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	The room was full of people when we first walked in, this was somewhat of a worry but my girlfriend made me wait it out since she wanted to eat inside the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service was very friendly even though one worker was constantly moving in and out between the dining room and the kitchen
FOOD	[ O  ]	The music and the atmosphere was very enjoyable
FOOD	[ date ]	My girlfriend was very pleased with the experience and suggested that we come back for a "date night"
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was very pleased that this experience was a great one
FOOD	[ O  ]	:)A real gem!  I don't get to Madison often but I am sure that if the next trip is near a meal time I know where I'll stop, Smoky Jon's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Recently our party of three each had a different entree, one that the host suggested after learning we were newby's
FOOD	[ O  ]	He guaranteed that we would love our choices and we all did
FOOD	[ BBQ, pork, sandwich, pork, tang ]	The BBQ pork sandwich was generous, the pork was extremely tender, cooked just right (not dried out or raw) had a smokey tang that makes it so special
FOOD	[ meat, bone ]	The ribs were cooked to perfection and tender meat nearly fell off each bone
FOOD	[ O  ]	Their sauce is mild and OK but I was surprised by the limited choices in that area
FOOD	[ O  ]	They offer several sides and the ones we sampled were all above par
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place is adorned with "Best Of" plaques and I can see why
FOOD	[ Ale ]	My husband and I tried Smoky's for the first time a few weeks ago after checking out the new Ale Asylum location
FOOD	[ O  ]	I used to live in an apartment complex not far from Smoky's and always meant to try it and never did
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't believe it took me this long! It was awesome
FOOD	[ bbq ]	I've traveled in the south a bit so I think I can tell good bbq  when I taste it (even though I'm a Wisconsin native) and this was the real deal
FOOD	[ pork, pork, corn, beans ]	I had the pork dinner (not sure if that's how it's listed on the menu) which included their pork shoulder and ribs along with 2 sides (I had the corn and beans)
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was A LOT of food
FOOD	[ pork, sandwich ]	Next time I'll stick to either just ribs or just a pork sandwich
FOOD	[ beef ]	My husband had ribs and beef brisquet
FOOD	[ O  ]	He couldn't stop raving
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant is small and was full when we showed up shortly before closing time
FOOD	[ O  ]	A table opened up quickly though
FOOD	[ O  ]	They started mopping up as we were eating (which the staff had graciously "warned" us about) but it didn't take away from the delicious food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hopefully it doesn't take as long as at did for my first visit to get there a second time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Restaurant Review
FOOD	[ O  ]	Off the beaten path in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had looked up this place before on tripadvisor and was not disappointed
FOOD	[ block ]	The restaurant itself is super small and the parking in front is rather limited (I had to drive around the block twice and realized that there was no parking in the back)
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Built as best BBQ in madison I was not disappointed
FOOD	[ bone ]	Fall of the bone tender ribs along with two sides was the meal I had
FOOD	[ sugar, biscuits ]	Get the sugar fried biscuits and you won't be disappointed
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place could be on diner and drives and I am glad I found it one my own! Also prices are super reasonable
FOOD	[ O  ]	No wonder why they won so many awards for there food
FOOD	[ bbq ]	Best bbq sauce period
FOOD	[ bbq ]	Pro- Inexpensive, delicious bbq, hidden gem
FOOD	[ O  ]	Con- Small seating area, small parking, closes at 8:30 PM
FOOD	[ bang, BBQ ]	Hidden deal- Order the combo to get the best bang for your buckRIBS RIBS RIBS! I like me some niceeee slab of ribs, drizzled in a tangy, but slightly sweet BBQ sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	Smoky Jon's definitely delivered!! They held  true to their many awards (nicely displayed next to their register) and I was more than content once I finished eating
FOOD	[ O  ]	The ribs themselves were just ordinary- pretty juicy, but nothing to blow my mind
FOOD	[ corn ]	What I found amazing was the sauce and the sides!!! The corn was deliciousss, especially all dressed up in their special seasoning
FOOD	[ garlic, mashed potatoes ]	The garlic mashed potatoes tasted just like the ones I usually make at home, which are pretttty darn amazing- if I should say so myself
FOOD	[ O  ]	One downfall was that there is a $4
FOOD	[ O  ]	00 plate splitting fee (BOOOOO!)
FOOD	[ sandwich, bucks ]	I really wanted to try the 1/2 slab + sandwich + sides combo (only like 2 bucks more than just 1/2 slab) but I knew I couldn't finish it by myself
FOOD	[ O  ]	and it just wouldnt be worth it to pay $4
FOOD	[ O  ]	00 more to share it with a friend
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hmm
FOOD	[ O  ]	or maybe, next time don't be as dumb as me and say out loud you want to share
FOOD	[ O  ]	sneakily share it at the table!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Anyways, Smoky Jon's was a great farewell from Madison meal for me, leaving me nice and full, the perfect prep for a long flight back to Los Angeles
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd give it a solid 4 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tucked away on the north side of Madison
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	I've driven past it thousands of times but went there yesterday on a recommendation from a friend of mine who knows his BBQ
FOOD	[ O  ]	Soooooo gooooooood
FOOD	[ pork, sandwich ]	I had the pork shoulder sandwich
FOOD	[ baked beans, flavor ]	The baked beans were pure flavor country
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	I wish everything I ate from here on out could be drizzled in that BBQ sauce
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was pretty quick and the prices were not bad either
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll be coming back again
FOOD	[ Chuck ]	My awesome partner Chuck brought me takeout the other night
FOOD	[ O  ]	Delicious
FOOD	[ pulled pork, sandwiches ]	We had some ribs and pulled pork sandwiches
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Love the BBQ sauce
FOOD	[ Potato salad, BBQ, BBQ ]	Potato salad was awesome also! Wish we had some good BBQ in Illinois!First things first: the house BBQ sauce is fabulous
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	I love that it isn't just the regular brown house made goop that most BBQ joints serve
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can actually see and taste all the different spices/herbs!! Like I said, fabulous
FOOD	[ pork, sandwich, potato salad, corn ]	I went with the smoked chopped pork shoulder sandwich platter and two sides: the potato salad and the corn
FOOD	[ corn ]	If you (like me) choose to order the corn to ease your conscience (after all, it is a vegetable, right?)
FOOD	[ O  ]	do not be fooled
FOOD	[ corn, buttery ]	The corn is puuuure buttery goodness
FOOD	[ potato salad, sandwich ]	The potato salad is also delicious! Truly, the perfect complement to the sandwich
FOOD	[ dill, potato ]	Creamy, no skin, no dill, just the way I like my potato salads
FOOD	[ O  ]	:9
FOOD	[ O  ]	At $8
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	45, the sandwich platters are very reasonably priced for the quantity of food you get
FOOD	[ O  ]	The takeout service is super quick as well - I think I got my food within 2-3 minutes of placing my order
FOOD	[ O  ]	Otherwise, Smoky Jon's seems like a fun place to dine in as well (lots of exposed wooden paneling and checkered tablecloths)
FOOD	[ O  ]	You'll probably want to limit your party to a group of 4 or less though, the seating is limited!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yelp recommendations for what to order as a first-timer to Smoky Jon's are on point
FOOD	[ O  ]	I can't wait to be back to try the ribs!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Tip: their parking lot is tiny and shared with the bar next door, so don't expect to find any open spaces around lunch or dinner time
FOOD	[ O  ]	You'll have better luck parking on one of the residential streets behind the joint
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was very excited as I entered and saw all the plaques and trophies
FOOD	[ brisket ]	I ordered the ribs and brisket expecting I'd order again
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was somewhat disappointed after my first bite
FOOD	[ meat ]	The sauce was a bit too sweet and the meat kinda dry
FOOD	[ barbecue ]	I was hoping this is going to be my barbecue place in Madison but I guess I have to keep on looking
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is gonna be a difficult review to write and I don't want anyone to take it the wrong way
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Smoky Jons is good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I mean, it's smoked, slow-cooked, sauce-covered, deliciously unctuous dead pig
FOOD	[ O  ]	 By nature, it's delicious and awesome and good for your soul
FOOD	[ barbecue ]	But all barbecue is good
FOOD	[ barbecue ]	 Good barbecue is great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Smoky Jons is
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm in Madison a few times a week for work and we've driven by this place a hundred times and every time said "We should stop in here"
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We finally did yesterday
FOOD	[ O  ]	The interior is nice, an order counter, a few tables, and a log-cabin'esque interior
FOOD	[ O  ]	 An okay place to eat lunch
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	 The menu is pretty expansive, with a good selection of sandwiches, platters, combos, sausages, sides, desserts, etc
FOOD	[ meat ]	 Whatever you like, meat-wise, you can find it here
FOOD	[ pork, dinner plate ]	After perusing the menu, I decided on the chopped pork shoulder dinner plate
FOOD	[ pork ]	 I should say my family is from Tennessee and I grew up on chopped pork
FOOD	[ BBQ, old man ]	 I grew up eating at shady back-country Tennessee BBQ places with dirt floors and plank counters and a weathered old man in the back basting a pig
FOOD	[ Barbecue, blood ]	 Barbecue is in my blood
FOOD	[ O  ]	Smoky Jons was not up to par
FOOD	[ meat ]	 The meat was delicious, but not smoky at all
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You literally could not taste the pit, or the smoke, or the fire
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The sauce was good too, but soooo sweet
FOOD	[ vinegar ]	 I guess I grew up on a vinegar sauce and I realize that sauce is an intensely regional thing, but this was not what I enjoyed
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sides were excellent
FOOD	[ Coleslaw ]	 Coleslaw is great
FOOD	[ Beans ]	 Beans are perfect
FOOD	[ Sugar, biscuits ]	 Sugar biscuits are delish
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Honestly, this is the best BBQ I've had in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But I've had better at several places in Milwaukee
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And I've had better at countless places in the south
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	I know Smokey Jon's is apparently world-renowned for their BBQ so you should probably try it yourself, and honestly I'll probably go back again
FOOD	[ O  ]	My favorite though?  No
FOOD	[ O  ]	A-OK?  Yes, certainly
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Was driving by Madison and thought we'd get some BBQ
FOOD	[ chicken, chicken, breast, bun ]	 I had the spicy chicken, which was just a chicken breast on a bun, with sauce on the side
FOOD	[ chicken, breast ]	 That was it, not even a big chicken breast? 
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	My wife had the turkey sandwich, which didn't appear to be anything special either
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It looked like it was from a grocery store
FOOD	[ brats ]	Kids liked the burger and brats
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	What I didn't like was the prices, sandwich platters were $8
FOOD	[ O  ]	45 each and drinks were $1
FOOD	[ O  ]	99 each
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Wasted my money on these as they don't give you a drink you can take with you and it's a plastic cup
FOOD	[ biscuit ]	What I did like was the sides, except for the one order of fried biscuit, which was raw in the middle
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Threw them out
FOOD	[ BBQ, sauces ]	Last, I've never been to a BBQ place with no sauces on the table and only one served with the order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I liked the sauce, but with all of the awards on the wall, they should offer a few options
FOOD	[ pulled pork ]	Should have gotten the pulled pork
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had to make sure I didn't leave any sauce on my fingers prior to typing this
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wait, did I? Nope, clean
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Most likely because I licked them clean from the baller sauce that is on this BBQ
FOOD	[ meat ]	The sauce has a great consistency to it and it clings nicely to the meat
FOOD	[ pork, sandwich, brisket ]	I went with the sig-other and between the two of us, we had the pork shoulder sandwich,  brisket, and ribs
FOOD	[ fries, Cole, slaw ]	I think we both went with fries and the Cole-slaw for our sides
FOOD	[ O  ]	They were fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sides are sides
FOOD	[ corn bread ]	I realllllllly wish there would have been corn bread
FOOD	[ corn bread, BBQ ]	Something doesn't right within me if there is no corn bread to accompany BBQ
FOOD	[ cornbread ]	I was sad when I found out there was no cornbread
FOOD	[ O  ]	But then I was happy again the moment I was able to put that delicious pig in my mouth
FOOD	[ O  ]	The ribs were ribs
FOOD	[ brisket, pork ]	The brisket and the pork shoulder was where it was at for me, but really, I think you can slap that sauce on cardboard and it would be delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm a west-sider so coming out here is a haul
FOOD	[ O  ]	A worth while haul
FOOD	[ O  ]	Be prepared to wait though; the dining room is small
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They did get out food out to us really quickly, but if we would have come 15 minutes later we would have had to wait in a long line to place our order, and then would have had no where to sit
FOOD	[ leftovers ]	Oh, and if I wasn't such a bottomless pit, there would have been plenty of leftovers as the portions are plentiful
FOOD	[ O  ]	I definitely did not leave hungry
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Delicious BBQ from friendly, saucy folk
FOOD	[ brisket, heat ]	The brisket was as good as any I've had in Texas and the sauce was sweet, spicy and with a little heat
FOOD	[ corn, fries, coleslaw, beans, biscuits, beignets ]	They also offer a number of tempting sides (you get 2 with most everything on the menu) including a great corn, skin on fries, coleslaw, beans and deep fried biscuits that look and taste like the beignets from New Orleans
FOOD	[ block ]	Parking is limited so you may need to park a block away in the neighborhood and just walk over the restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Located near the Oscar Mayer factory on Packer road
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Definitely worth a visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We will definitely be back when we head back to Madison in the fall
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	When thinking BBQ you do not think of Madison,WI
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is the one exception to that rule
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	 The food here is by hands down the best BBQ in Southern Wisconsin, there is nothing on the menu that you can go wrong with
FOOD	[ mask, cover, meat ]	 What is even better the award winning sauce does not mask or cover bad meat but creates an even better experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seating is limited and parking is even more so, you can park on the side road (Manley St)  off of Packers Ave
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've eaten at Smoky Jon's a couple of times over the last few years
FOOD	[ BBQ, chili, beans ]	Their BBQ sauce is fantastic, their chili is great (when in season), and their beans are delicious
FOOD	[ meat, brisket, pulled pork ]	Unfortunately I find their meat to be kind of bland, if very tender -- this has been consistent across all of my visits, trying ribs, brisket, and pulled pork
FOOD	[ O  ]	Policies regarding customers can be strange
FOOD	[ O  ]	On our latest visit, my girlfriend and I were going to be charged a $4 plate splitting fee for sharing a meal at lunch
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was no combination of additional sides that would abate this fee, only the purchase of a second full meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	We opted for take-out
FOOD	[ O  ]	ok food but most of it is frozen or canned and the ribs gave me the shits
FOOD	[ O  ]	I gave myself an hour to eat dining in before I have to catch a plane
FOOD	[ O  ]	I ordered
FOOD	[ O  ]	I waited 45 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	It seemed busy and I was stupid enough to keep waiting even though I see the guy who ordered before me get his and leave 20 minutes in
FOOD	[ O  ]	I didn't have anymore time and asked them to check my order
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nope, the ticket was lost
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was so hungry and so sad that I couldn't get any ribs
FOOD	[ rush ]	In the state of chaos that the kitchen and staff was in, there was no way they were gonna rush the order out in time even for to-go
FOOD	[ O  ]	I had to get a refund and speed to the airport
FOOD	[ O  ]	For what it's worth I don't think the 1 woman on wait staff was to blame
FOOD	[ O  ]	The owner really threw her under the bus by understaffing on a busy night
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's so many people, so many orders
FOOD	[ O  ]	There was another girl just taking orders
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just standing and waiting, while the other woman ran back and forth with bags and bags of food
FOOD	[ O  ]	What kind of restaurant is this? It's such a weird sight in a restaurant: one girl running another girl standing
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But at least I know she put my ticket into the kitchen
FOOD	[ O  ]	Someone fucked up in the kitchen; someone threw away my ticket
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will not be coming back and will not be sending any friends and family here either
FOOD	[ O  ]	For all the awards the place gets and all its years of being in business, I wish it just wasn't so amateur at being a restaurant
FOOD	[ BBQ, pork, sandwich, potato salad, beans ]	My precious little brother has been going on about Smoky Jon's for some time now and we finally made a trip that allowed us to head on into this fabulous establishment!  I couldn't quite decide what I wanted so I went with my usual BBQ joint pick - pork sandwich!  I opted for the potato salad and beans on the side
FOOD	[ O  ]	 My entire plate of food was delicious and I'd absolutely come back again
FOOD	[ beef, sandwich, bbq, BBQ ]	 The only thing I didn't love was my husbands chopped beef sandwich - but, lucky for me, I went with my ol' bbq joint standby ;)For Madison, this BBQ is pretty spectacular
FOOD	[ O  ]	Anywhere else and I'd give it 4 stars but, considering the location, it's damn good and deserving of 5 stars
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	The food's good, the staff is friendly, and (for freshly-made BBQ) the service is usually quick
FOOD	[ O  ]	So
FOOD	[ O  ]	this is the kind of food that will kill you
FOOD	[ O  ]	So there's that
FOOD	[ O  ]	But that being said, this is the best way I can think of to take in food with absolutely no nutritional value
FOOD	[ meat ]	The ribs are sweet sticky tender meat bars
FOOD	[ flavor, flavor ]	The sides are sweet sticky flavor bombs of flavor
FOOD	[ buttery ]	The rolls are airy buttery balls of carbohydrates
FOOD	[ O  ]	You should get extra napkins
FOOD	[ O  ]	I think this place is best for carryout
FOOD	[ O  ]	You can sit and eat - there are a handful of tables, but then there are also bullet holes in the windows
FOOD	[ O  ]	Since it's Madison, I'm assuming someone put them there for show, but definitely with a real gun, so anyway I'd rather eat at home
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Also, if you've been doing the House of Cards thing and want that BBQ experience but you don't live in the south, this is the closest you are going to get
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	So, check it out Madison, it's a little bit different but that doesn't mean it isn't fabulous!Delicious BBQ, especially for a place in WI
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is known for its ribs, and it deserves the praise it gets for them
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are some other hits, and some less than stellar items on the menu
FOOD	[ chicken, chicken ]	We got the half slab and jumbo 1/2 chicken dinner to share, which was huge! Big portions, but the chicken was really dry
FOOD	[ O  ]	The ribs were amazing
FOOD	[ beef, brisket, chicken ]	We also ordered some beef brisket, which is a much smaller portion than the ribs and chicken
FOOD	[ fatty, brisket, brisket ]	If you're not a fan of fatty brisket (like me) than you'll be quite happy with their brisket
FOOD	[ string, date ]	No awkward moments of biting into a string of fat and trying to spit it out in front of your date
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sides, overall, could be better
FOOD	[ O  ]	But lets be honest, you're not here for the sides
FOOD	[ buck ]	If you don't want to order any sides you'll save about a buck, but it's worth it to venture out and try them
FOOD	[ baked beans ]	The baked beans were iffy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I heard a lot of good things about them via Yelp, but ours were grey-ish and tasted off
FOOD	[ potato salad, mayo ]	The potato salad is definitely full fat and more mayo based
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	It's a nice and cool way to offset the kick of BBQ
FOOD	[ french fries ]	The french fries are more run-of-the-mill than anything else here
FOOD	[ biscuits ]	We also tried the fried biscuits after seeing so many people rave about them
FOOD	[ carnival ]	Maybe I had too high of expectations? They were good, they tasted a bit like carnival food, but they didn't garner a "Oh my, I'd eat these every day if I could" opinion like the ribs did
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	The sauce here is unlike any other BBQ sauce I've ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a bit chunky and sweeter than usual but has a nice kick at the end
FOOD	[ O  ]	Definitely go for the ribs
FOOD	[ brisket ]	The brisket is good
FOOD	[ Chicken ]	Chicken could be better
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sides are hit or miss
FOOD	[ O  ]	We got take-out since the seating is limited
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's also pretty loud there, lots of people talking and loud music
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	I'd definitely recommend this place!Great BBQ! Excellent customer service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Place is really busy at lunch time so prepare to stand in line
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Awesome BBQ! Great price for great food! Best in Madison
FOOD	[ garlic, mashed potatoes, sugar, biscuits, pulled pork ]	I highly recommend the garlic mashed potatoes and sugar fried biscuits! I got the pulled pork and loved the sauce
FOOD	[ balance ]	Sauce was slightly sweet with a great balance of hers and spices
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was LIGHTNING fast and extremely friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wish we ha this kind of place down in Chicago!Thumbs up to an 8
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	95 sandwich platter that includes two sides and fills me up like no other
FOOD	[ O  ]	Seriously
FOOD	[ O  ]	The amount of food
FOOD	[ O  ]	The quality
FOOD	[ brisket, corn, fries ]	That sauce! Go grab yourself a brisket sammie with corn and fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	You'll thank me tomorrow
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	The ribs are the best BBQ in Madison by far and have never disappointed in many visits
FOOD	[ O  ]	The rest of the menu is inconsequential -- trust me, just get the ribs
FOOD	[ barbeque ]	Damn good barbeque
FOOD	[ O  ]	Possibly the best I've had in Madison if I'm looking for something rich that will definitely fill you up and leave you feeling guilty
FOOD	[ O  ]	The ribs are top notch and the sauce is just right
FOOD	[ Meat, bone ]	Meat falls right off the bone and the sides are adequate
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just wish they had a spicy variant of some of their items
FOOD	[ O  ]	The interior goes great with the food; lots of vintage Americana items and newspaper cutouts of stunning reviews of the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	The service is very friendly, always willing to help you make up your mind about menu choices
FOOD	[ entrée ]	The wait isn't very long for an entrée and that's valuable
FOOD	[ pulled pork ]	A friend I came with had the pulled pork burger and praised it greatly
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food really lives up to its record-setting reputation
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'll be back in moderation so as not to clog my pipes up
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very quaint little place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Seats 24 people inside so if you're having a party, it's best to get it to go
FOOD	[ rack, Garlic, Mashed Potatoes, salad ]	 I had the 1/2 rack of Ribs platter which came with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and a side salad
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The platter was served with a roll as well
FOOD	[ salad, lettuce, carrot ]	 The size of the side salad was great and it even had different lettuce types and carrot matchsticks
FOOD	[ Garlic, ice cream ]	 The Garlic Mashed was very tasty but there wasn't a lot - perhaps a small ice cream scoop (like, tiny child size)
FOOD	[ fruity, Barbeque ]	 That's great for portion control!  The ribs were very tender and the sauce was a sweet, fruity vinegary Barbeque
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I found it overwhelming with a small bite but then as I noshed on, it was very good
FOOD	[ chicken, chicken, char, meat ]	 My husband got the 1/2 chicken and it was fantastic!  The chicken was moist there was a touch of char and the sauce was quite elegant with the meat
FOOD	[ coleslaw, coleslaw ]	 The creamy coleslaw was quite tasty, in fact, if you're a person who loved your mom's creamy coleslaw from the 1960's (it was actually based off a Miracle Whip recipe) then this is the one for you
FOOD	[ sandwich, cole, slaw, biscuits, funnel cake ]	 Next time I return, I'm trying a sandwich, with cole slaw and the biscuits ("tastes like a funnel cake" says the server)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 NOTE: If you share a plate there is a $4 surcharge
FOOD	[ O  ]	Checked this out based on the reviews
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Good selection, a little bit more pricey than some others
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Very good ribs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Served with a lot of sauce which I wiped off a bit to find the ribs with a pleasantly smoky taste
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very tender
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Service was mediocre, waitress wasn't exactly rude but wasn't very friendly either
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not sure about the neighborhood, I haven't had to show an id to use a credit card in this area before
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'd go 5 star but for the service, but maybe I hit them on a bad day
FOOD	[ O  ]	This was our first time trying Smokey Jons
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It is a new favorite for sure
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The space was small but cozy, and the food definitely deserves best in Madison (or the universe)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Patanne (the lovely lady who took our order) was friendly and made us feel right at home
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We will be back
FOOD	[ BBQ, melt ]	Best BBQ in Madison! Ribs are amazing, and the fried sweet rolls melt in your mouth
FOOD	[ beignets ]	They basically the best beignets I have ever had
FOOD	[ O  ]	I stop here almost every time on my way to the airport
FOOD	[ O  ]	WwoOOW!  It is really that good here!  If u don't stop u are missing out BIG TIME!  Great food!I had lunch at Smoky Jon's on my first day in Madison
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	 I had seen stellar reviews, claiming it was the best BBQ in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Unfortunately, I was disappointed
FOOD	[ brisket, sandwich, fries, salad ]	I ordered the brisket sandwich meal with fries and a side salad
FOOD	[ fries, fries, fries ]	 The fries were the best thing on the plate (maybe it's because I don't have fries very often), but these fries were just okay
FOOD	[ salad, romaine lettuce ]	 The salad was just bagged romaine lettuce with dressing in a packet
FOOD	[ brisket, fatty, brisket, meat ]	 I know that brisket can be a little fatty, but my brisket was almost as much fat as meat
FOOD	[ brisket, bun, fork ]	 The brisket had soaked through the bottom side of my bun, so I ate it - or half of it - with a fork
FOOD	[ O  ]	I assume Smoky Jon's had an off-day when I was there because they really get great user reviews
FOOD	[ O  ]	Four stars for the normal quality
FOOD	[ O  ]	Last night though got take out and the order was wrong - too far to drive back
FOOD	[ pork ]	The pork and the ribs were WAY over cooked - or better said kept hot way too long
FOOD	[ pork ]	The pork was mushy and the ribs dry and hard
FOOD	[ O  ]	I know waste in the restaurant biz is a killer but I have heard this from a couple of people now and am hoping you get back to your usual quality control
FOOD	[ chicken ]	The chicken though was as perfect as ever
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Don't let the quality slip!I've lived in Madison for almost 3 years and have stupidly spent most of that time heading to Brickhouse BBQ whenever the porky craving strikes
FOOD	[ O  ]	No longer! This place is the real deal
FOOD	[ pulled pork, sandwich, garlic, mashed potatoes, biscuits ]	I can't speak to the entire menu because I order the same thing every time I'm there: pulled pork sandwich, garlic mashed potatoes, biscuits
FOOD	[ mashed potatoes ]	The mashed potatoes are stupid good, like, eyes-roll-in-the-back-of-your-head-with-the-first-bite good
FOOD	[ barrel ]	They give you a little cup, which is good for me because I could eat a whole barrel of the stuff
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	BBQ sauce has a bit of a kick, but isn't unbearably spicy
FOOD	[ cheese, bear ]	On my last visit, I saw they added mac and cheese to the menu (uuhhhhhh yummmm) but I don't know if I can bear to part with one of my other sides to try it
FOOD	[ biscuits ]	I'll just have to make my boyfriend order double biscuits instead
FOOD	[ O  ]	Awesome!! Can't believe i drove by it a million times and never went
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best ribs!!The best!  They have been around a long time and have thrived when other rib places come and go
FOOD	[ O  ]	I make the long trip across town when I need a half-slab
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ever since moving out to Milwaukee I've had a craving for this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wish I could get back to Madison a little bit more often just to make another trip to Smoky Jon's
FOOD	[ O  ]	Walking in it's clear what your in for
FOOD	[ O  ]	Jon has rib credentials! The walls are covered in awards and certificates the guy has won
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best sauce, best ribs,  best this, best that
FOOD	[ O  ]	You don't get the awards this place has without knowing what you're doing
FOOD	[ O  ]	I almost always get the ribs (because how can you not?)
FOOD	[ heat ]	The sauce has just enough heat to really compliment the ribs
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	I've tried a few of the sandwiches, but I always end up coming back to the ribs because that's where this place really shines
FOOD	[ O  ]	The sides are also very good
FOOD	[ potato salad, coleslaw ]	The potato salad and coleslaw are my favorites
FOOD	[ BBQ, Baked Beans ]	I'm also big fan of the BBQ Baked Beans
FOOD	[ french fries, cole, slaw ]	The french fries are good enough if you get takeout from Smoky's (just because they travel a bit better than something like cole slaw), but with so much other great stuff to try you are really ripping yourself off if you stick to them
FOOD	[ O  ]	This is definitely one of my favorite places in Madtown
FOOD	[ O  ]	This has been on my radar for a while
FOOD	[ O  ]	See the pictures
FOOD	[ O  ]	First off this is important, when you walk in you smell smoke so I knew it was going to be good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very woody and tons of awards and plaques etc
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thy were not as smokey as I wanted and boldly came sauced
FOOD	[ bone ]	They were fall off the bone and had that pink smoke ring on the inside
FOOD	[ rack, beans, potato salad ]	I had the half rack with beans and potato salad
FOOD	[ bottle ]	The ribs were pretty good and I really liked the sauce and bought a bottle
FOOD	[ beans, potato salad ]	The beans were nothing special and the potato salad was average
FOOD	[ beans, meat ]	The beans would be great if they were smoked and hade little bits of meat in them
FOOD	[ O  ]	Sides are usually not the star and this was the case
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	The ribs are worth going for, my friends said this was there new BBQ place for them and they will be black
FOOD	[ brisket, sandwich ]	One person said the brisket sandwich was really good
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Over all this is a solid BBQ rib place
FOOD	[ sandwiches ]	Two thumbs upWhen I only ordered sandwiches I was doing it all wrong
FOOD	[ chicken, brisket ]	The way to go is to get a half chicken and the 1/3 slab combo with brisket
FOOD	[ O  ]	Insane amount of food? Yes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Worth getting to try all the best parts of the menu? Yes!Great rub on the ribs
FOOD	[ O  ]	Little to spicy sauce but, it was tasty
FOOD	[ cheese ]	Mac 'n cheese is ok
FOOD	[ Pork, brisket ]	Pork and brisket sandwichs are AWESOME
FOOD	[ O  ]	Definitely coming back!!!This place makes me miss when I used to live down in Georgia
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	but only for the phenomenal BBQ
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Seriously though, I haven't found a place with authentic Southern BBQ this north of the Mason-Dixie Line
FOOD	[ O  ]	until NOW!
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	For lunch, try the sandwich platter
FOOD	[ O  ]	There's a serious amount of food and it will fill you up
FOOD	[ chicken, brisket ]	Not enough you say? Ok, then go for the half-chicken with the brisket
FOOD	[ sauces, flavor ]	It's enough to fill up half the Confederate army! The sauces are full of flavor and delicious!
FOOD	[ O  ]	It may look like a hole-in-the-wall but it has 5-star food!Well, I read the reviews and thought this would be impressive
FOOD	[ beans, potato salad, beans, potato salad, condiments ]	Nothing could be farther from the truth! The dude at the counter appeared annoyed that we interrupted him yesterday, the portions on the beans and potato salad were miniscule (I was unaware that you could even serve beans and potato salad in a cup designed for condiments, but lo and behold, here it was--- 3 bites later and both were history)
FOOD	[ pulled pork, sandwiches ]	We had the pulled pork sandwiches, and I make better at home
FOOD	[ bbq ]	The bbq sauce was good, but that was about it
FOOD	[ O  ]	We don't plan on coming back ever, especially not for $23
FOOD	[ O  ]	00 for 2 people
FOOD	[ gelato ]	But, we did fill up on gelato at the mall about 20 minutes later as we were still hungry when we left
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm wondering where in the heck the other folks on here ate, because this wasn't at all the same experience they had
FOOD	[ O  ]	A few of us hit Smoky Jon's for lunch today
FOOD	[ BBQ, game ]	 It was insisted that it's the best BBQ in Madison, so I was game to try it
FOOD	[ O  ]	The place has character - you order at a window and go take a seat
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They bring the food out to you
FOOD	[ cups ]	 Nothing fancy - paper plates, styrofoam cups, etc
FOOD	[ pork, sandwich, coleslaw, french fries ]	I got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I snarfed a fry to start
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not very hot
FOOD	[ O  ]	"warm", I'd say
FOOD	[ O  ]	But tasty - salty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Could have been better if fresh, but they'll do
FOOD	[ coleslaw ]	 The coleslaw was the creamiest I've ever had
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 The flavor wasn't strong, but it was okay
FOOD	[ salt, pepper ]	 Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found
FOOD	[ pork ]	 The pork was tasty - definitely smokey
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The side of sauce made it, however
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Sweet, tangy, spicy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 While I was eating it, I thought "yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it"
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, "you know, that was REALLY good!"
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	While it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd have it again
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water)
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I was full, and content
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Mission accomplished!
FOOD	[ fatty ]	My coworker had some ribs, and they looked very good - not too fatty, cooked well
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I would like to go back and try them sometime!
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Tip:  Limited seating, so show up early (or late!)This local BBQ icon was on our list of dining destinations when Santi and I were planning our trip to Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Located nearby the airport, the well-lit, wooded interior starts with a pathway that leads to the large overhead menu, the ordering counter, and the dining area
FOOD	[ O  ]	Adding to the décor are the statewide accolades all around the walls
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	On this evening, the casual atmosphere happened to be unexpectedly subdued, quite unlike the other BBQ restaurants I've visited
FOOD	[ O  ]	  
FOOD	[ O  ]	We shared a Combination Meal ($17
FOOD	[ choice, Pork, Sandwich, pork, Cole, Slaw, BBQ, Baked Beans ]	75) that included our choice of 1/3 Slab, Smoked Pork Shoulder Sandwich, and extra serving of smoked pork shoulder, Cole Slaw, and BBQ Baked Beans
FOOD	[ Pork, meat ]	The Slab/Pork Ribs were smoky, tender, and the meat easily peeled off the bones
FOOD	[ flavor, BBQ ]	There was an excellent hint of smoke to deepen its flavor, and that was further enhanced by the BBQ sauce to provide a sweet higher note, strong black peppery secondary, and anchored by a noticeable spicy kick that reverberates with good hops
FOOD	[ meat ]	For the price, there wasn't enough meat on the ribs, but the flavors were still sensational
FOOD	[ O  ]	The dinner roll that this dish came with was sweet, soft, and spongy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I loved it
FOOD	[ Pork, Sandwich ]	The Pork Shoulder Sandwich was excellent as well
FOOD	[ pork, BBQ ]	The pork shoulders were tender without one single dry spot--perfectly executed and delicious without the BBQ sauce
FOOD	[ meat, flavor, BBQ ]	The meat was flavorful and deepened by its smoky flavor that coupled perfectly with the well-rounded, full-bodied spicy BBQ sauce
FOOD	[ flavor ]	I absolutely loved it except for the buns that turned out flaky with hollow spots and lacking flavor
FOOD	[ meat ]	We finished the meat without getting into the buns very much
FOOD	[ sandwich, bun ]	This sandwich could have been so much better with a bun of higher quality
FOOD	[ BBQ, Baked Beans ]	The BBQ Baked Beans were smooth, sweet, and delicious
FOOD	[ Slaw ]	The Slaw on the other hand was too wet with a weak texture
FOOD	[ BBQ, beans, collard, greens, yam, BBQ ]	Compared to other BBQ joints, their sides could use more varieties such as green beans, collard greens, yam and other possibilities to complement this resounding BBQ
FOOD	[ sauces ]	They also have two sauces, and I wished we had the option of trying both at the table
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was impatient at first, as we were initially tentative and indecisive about our choices
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wished the server could have been much more educational with their strengths and limitations to help us make the right decisions on this very first visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, she later became much more warm, accessible, attentive, and helpful towards the middle and end of the meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	Price-wise, their items were pricy with the portions we received
FOOD	[ Beef, Chicken ]	I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Beef Briskets and Chicken Dinner
FOOD	[ O  ]	After surviving my first tornado scare in Madison, Wisconsin, my partner in crime, Daniel L
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	and I ventured out to this well known local BBQ hangout for some good old smoky ribs and all the fixings
FOOD	[ BBQ, pork, sandwich ]	With the Midwest reputation of having some of the finest meats, it was a no brainer to order the 1/3 slab BBQ smoked ribs and pork shoulder sandwich combination dinner ($14
FOOD	[ O  ]	75)
FOOD	[ pork, beef, brisket ]	The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs
FOOD	[ pork, meat, BBQ ]	The pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce
FOOD	[ grease, pork ]	It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork
FOOD	[ bun, bread, bun ]	The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination
FOOD	[ meat, BBQ, pork, meat, bone ]	We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce
FOOD	[ baked beans, cole, slaw ]	Our dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw
FOOD	[ cups, BBQ ]	Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce
FOOD	[ BBQ, flavor ]	It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor
FOOD	[ cole, slaw ]	I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold
FOOD	[ baked beans ]	The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive
FOOD	[ O  ]	The cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!This was the second time I've eaten here
FOOD	[ brisket ]	 The first time was a few years ago and I had the brisket and ribs
FOOD	[ brisket ]	 The ribs were really good and the brisket was decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was the flat and was cut thin, probably because it was a touch dry
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 It had a good flavor though
FOOD	[ brisket ]	The second time was this month (July 2014) and I got the brisket platter with two sides
FOOD	[ baked beans ]	 The baked beans were decent
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nothing special, but tasted fine
FOOD	[ cheese ]	 The Mac-n-cheese was pretty good
FOOD	[ cheese sauce, macaroni ]	 There was a lot of cheese sauce in relation to macaroni
FOOD	[ cheese ]	 I like a little crunch to my mac and cheese, but this was thick and creamy, which is OK
FOOD	[ brisket ]	 The brisket was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It wasn't cut paper thin, had a nice smoke ring and was easily pulled apart with fingers
FOOD	[ O  ]	 In other words it was tender and not dry at all
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Much better than the first time I visited
FOOD	[ brisket ]	 My only complaint would be they put sauce on the brisket
FOOD	[ barbeque, brisket ]	 I prefer sauce on the side because good barbeque doesn't need sauce and this brisket didn't need sauce
FOOD	[ BBQ ]	Jon's place is good quality BBQ and I can see why it gets the following, but I would agree with a few that have said it's not the best they have had
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I how ever can see why many have said it's great
FOOD	[ BBQ, Brisket, Sausage, Chicken ]	 Madison lacks good BBQ so it was refreshing to see a place putting out nice Ribs, Brisket, Sausage and Chicken
FOOD	[ Brisket ]	I especially liked the ribs, but found the sauce a little spicy for the Brisket
FOOD	[ Brisket, sandwich ]	 I'd like to try a sweeter sauce on the Brisket sandwich, but their original sauce pairs perfectly with the ribs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I had three meats and all were perfectly cooked
FOOD	[ cups ]	 Part of my giving 4 stars for the size of there sides which are served in condiment cups
FOOD	[ cups ]	 Jon, please admit your side cups are small
FOOD	[ O  ]	please
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I will be back very soon for the Ribs 
FOOD	[ O  ]	see you soon
FOOD	[ fast food ]	I normally do not like to review fast food establishments, because they are normally large chains that have about the same stuff all over
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fazoli's is a little different
FOOD	[ chicken ]	First it is Italian and not the normal burger or chicken place
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is good, not a great Italian meal that you would find in Italy, but good and filling
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is served hot and fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	The breadsticks are above average and you get as many as you want
FOOD	[ fast food ]	If you want fast food, but not the normal, give Fazoli's a try
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you want "Italian food" that has the look and feel of a Stouffer's t
FOOD	[ O  ]	dinner, Fazoli's gets it right
FOOD	[ O  ]	Actually, I take that back
FOOD	[ O  ]	 If you are heating up a t
FOOD	[ O  ]	dinner, at least you are guaranteed it will be warm
FOOD	[ O  ]	Very frustrating experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Our order was very simple but the cashier couldn't get it right
FOOD	[ O  ]	 While waiting for our food I watched the beleaguered manager apologizing to every table
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Every customer had a problem with their food or order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We waited twenty minutes for our food and decided to leave
FOOD	[ O  ]	  I have never experienced more incompetence
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Never again
FOOD	[ fast food ]	Food is okay for a fast food Italian restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	They bring you our food and they clean it too; it's like they are trying to convert to an actual restaurant with waiters and bus boys
FOOD	[ O  ]	The unlimited breadsticks are for dine-ins only
FOOD	[ O  ]	Have only had one bad service where they took a while for my one meal but they did handle it well by apologizing and giving me a coupon for a free meal next time
FOOD	[ Olive ]	Awesome service and the food is great! The alfredo is a bit lighter than Olive Garden which I personally like and the breadsticks are to DIE FOR
FOOD	[ spaghetti ]	Also if you save your receipt there is a website to fill in a survey and you get a free spaghetti/sauce entree (regular sized which is good sized) for the price of a drink (turns out to be less than $2)! This is a great deal because even if you do this they give you another receipt and you can keep getting the deal
FOOD	[ pasta, lasagna, spaghetti ]	Also if you go before 3 they have a good lunch special which is 2 1/2 portions of pasta/lasagna and a drink for $5! Great fast restaurant and the manager is phenomenal!I bought a spaghetti dinner and it was really good food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hot, tasted good, and decent sized serving for the price
FOOD	[ O  ]	I liked that I got my food quickly and the staff was friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	There is a drive-thru
FOOD	[ gyro ]	For my money this is the best place in Madison to get a gyro
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The place is a little shady and hasn't been updated since it was built, but you'll get a lot of good food for not a lot of cash and you will get it with a smile and that makes all the difference
FOOD	[ gyros, gyro ]	 The gyros are essentially the same as Parthenon and, for that matter, 99% of all gyro places
FOOD	[ gyro, meat ]	 I go with the gyro dinner, however, which is double the meat and is absolutely glorious in all of its artery clogging goodness
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've never tried any of their other items, but they have your usual deep fried fare if you are so inclined
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Also, the owner always seems to be there and in a friendly mood as opposed to the dour S
FOOD	[ O  ]	s downtown
FOOD	[ O  ]	After reading other Yelp reviews, I decided to try Dimitri's, unfortunately
FOOD	[ gyro, meat ]	The gyro meat was bland
FOOD	[ gyros, spinach, pie ]	gyros are not meant to be BLAND! We also tried the so-called spinach pie
FOOD	[ O  ]	Again, it's pretty bland and seems like it came from a grocery store freezer
FOOD	[ O  ]	It isn't actually *bad*
FOOD	[ O  ]	it's just not *good*
FOOD	[ O  ]	so I gave it two stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	There is much better food in Madison
FOOD	[ gyros ]	If you want gyros, go to the Parthenon
FOOD	[ spinach, pie, Cafe ]	If you want spinach pie, go to Med Cafe
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you're on the East side and you're desperate, go to Dimitri's
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Jet Room is our go to place for breakfast with visiting friends
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food of a down home diner, but with a huge wall of windows that look out onto the tarmac for WI Aviation
FOOD	[ O  ]	little commuter planes come and go while you eat some of the best breakfast around
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The pancakes are AMAZING!
FOOD	[ Fox ]	Only issue is that TV is always tuned to Fox News, but on mute, so are easy to ignore
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A packed place on weekends - so call ahead for seating or get there early!OK - Let's be reasonable! 
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars is an incredible score, but here is why I gave it
FOOD	[ O  ]	This diner is a hidden gem
FOOD	[ O  ]	I mean hidden, the only reason I went was because someone told me about it
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is located in the Wisconsin Aviation building off of Stoughton Road at the end of Amelia Earhart Dr
FOOD	[ O  ]	There are no signs outside for this restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Once inside, it is clean, tastefully decorated, awesome view of the airport, attentive service and finally awesome food
FOOD	[ O  ]	- that's 5 reasons for 5 stars
FOOD	[ crab ]	I had crab cakes Benedict
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh yea! That is as good as it sounds baby
FOOD	[ hash browns, cheese, onions ]	Then I upgraded my hash browns with cheese, onions, and peppers
FOOD	[ O  ]	Well worth the up charge
FOOD	[ O  ]	It will be hard for me to pick something different from their menu when I go back, AND I WILL BE GOING BACK
FOOD	[ brunch ]	brunch in Madison
FOOD	[ Brunch ]	Brunch at airport  - "huh" right? Right
FOOD	[ O  ]	The restaurant is located with in the Wisconsin Aviation building, which is across the field from where the commercial flights are housed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You can eat the fantastic food while plane watch for your pleasure
FOOD	[ O  ]	If you haven't been here already, you're missing out - A
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	The airy pancakes that I ordered were fluffy, and really the best I've had in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	It sounds like a "guilty pleasure," but the pancakes are truly airy that it doesn't feel heavy on the stomach after clearing the plate
FOOD	[ eggs ]	The three eggs omelet was equally spectacular
FOOD	[ O  ]	Plus the solid cordial service seals the 5-stars deal
FOOD	[ O  ]	The scene is a clean diner, but as my friend put it, "it's an actual diner with good food, and not like the other wanna-bes
FOOD	[ O  ]	" Absolutely correct
FOOD	[ O  ]	And there's no need to do too much flare on the decor when they got the fantastic view of the private planes against the blue sky
FOOD	[ O  ]	I will be back for more for sure! Maybe a sunset dinner for the next time?I'm a big fan of eating Midwest brunches and I can tell quality vs
FOOD	[ O  ]	quantity
FOOD	[ date, brunch ]	My boyfriend took me here on a surprise date because he is a big fan of watching planes take off, so I thought it was novel to have brunch there
FOOD	[ O  ]	The quality of the food blew me away as well as the friendly service
FOOD	[ crab, hollandaise sauce, eggs, bacon, fruit cup ]	We ordered crab cakes benedict with hollandaise sauce and the 2x2x2 (pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon, and fruit cup OR hashbrowns)
FOOD	[ buttery ]	 The other reviewers down below are correct that their pancakes are TDF light airy and buttery delicious
FOOD	[ crab ]	The crab cakes benedicts were perfect - not too rich, and not too heavy and very nicely presented
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The waitress was a middle aged woman who was very attentive to us
FOOD	[ O  ]	The price is also very reasonable for brunches in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would highly recommend this place, and I believe it is one of Madison's best kept secret diners
FOOD	[ meat ]	 It wasn't as cheap as the Come Back Inn located near the Essen Haus nor Plaka's Mediterranean meat intensive style brunches, however, the quality was far superior (and don't get me wrong, I adore the Come Back Inn!)
FOOD	[ O  ]	You'll also be interested in the proudly presented amateur photos of Air Force One from when President Obama visited Madison in Nov 2009, the staff were happy to give the run down of his landing at the private airstrip
FOOD	[ O  ]	I gave two stars, 1 star for the nice behavior of owners who welcome you into the restaurant with a smile and another star is the ambiance and my kiddo loved it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Worst service
FOOD	[ O  ]	waitress (an Asian women) was very rude and made me feel like we are not welcome there
FOOD	[ O  ]	my two cents, if you are not a white man, please find a Dennis or Perkins and don't even bother to go to this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	I never wrote a review as bad as this and this place deserves it
FOOD	[ coffee ]	kind of hard to get a coffee refill here
FOOD	[ O  ]	losing a star for that
FOOD	[ skillet, bacon ]	i ate a delicious breakfast skillet with bacon on it
FOOD	[ bacon ]	and bacon is one of the only thing i have been able ot think about lately
FOOD	[ breakfast food ]	the food is regular breakfast food sort of unremakable
FOOD	[ O  ]	in fact, no better than the deforest family restaurant
FOOD	[ so fun ]	BUT: you can eat breakfast and watch planes take off!!1 so fun!!!! so that makes it pretty awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	This place is awesome! I went on a weekday, it was quite crowded but Pat O'Malley was hard at work accommodating us as best he could
FOOD	[ O  ]	We sat at the bar and had a fantastic breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pat took the time to ask our names and he was always looking out for everyone on his staff
FOOD	[ O  ]	You should definitely place this restaurant on your list as a must do! Not to mention the ambiance/view is fabulous
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quick Review: Fantastic diner fare, very reasonably priced, and while it is located "off the beaten path," it offers a unique environment for young, old, locals, and visitors alike
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Give it a try!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Detailed review:
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been craving some pancakes for quite some time and have been on a mission to find the perfect stack
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've recently tried 'cakes from several Madison eateries and while most have been decent, none have knocked my socks off
FOOD	[ O  ]	So, I ventured out to Pat O'Malley's, which is located on the very north side of Truax field
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Or, as some might say, "in the middle of nowhere
FOOD	[ O  ]	"  Yes, it's a bit of a drive
FOOD	[ O  ]	and yes, it's a bit difficult to find
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But, it's well worth the effort - believe me
FOOD	[ O  ]	The Jet Room is located inside of the aviation building, which (for those not familiar) is where people lucky enough to not have to suffer the pains associated with public air transportation go for their arrivals and departures via private aircraft
FOOD	[ O  ]	The building features a nice lobby, a pilot's lounge, a small gift shop, a vending area, a front desk for travelers, and Pat O'Malley's
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's spotlessly clean, quiet, and completely opposite of what you'd find at any public airport
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There's plenty of parking available in front of the building
FOOD	[ O  ]	I entered the smallish diner and was promptly greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a small table with an awesome view of the airstrip
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Private planes of all types - from small jets to single engine craft - regularly took off and landed during my visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was fun to watch them arrive, taxi, unload, and all of that stuff
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pat's serves breakfast all day - or until they close, which is around 2:00pm
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Because I arrived at lunchtime, they shared the specials, which sounded (and looked) excellent, but I was there for the pancakes
FOOD	[ coffee, bacon ]	I promptly ordered a coffee, an order of pancakes, and a side of bacon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 After the waitress left, I took note of the food around me, and all of it looked great
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The burgers appeared to be thick and hand-formed
FOOD	[ sandwiches, rye ]	 Many sandwiches featured marbled rye
FOOD	[ fries ]	 The fries and sides were plentiful and appeared to be fresh and crispy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I could easily overhear folks talking during their meals and only heard positive comments about the lunch items
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I'll definitely have to head back to check them out
FOOD	[ O  ]	After a very short wait, my food arrived - the pancakes were thick, but as Mio confirmed, light and fluffy
FOOD	[ Butter ]	 Butter was served on the side; I lathered the cakes with some of that creamy dairy, splashed on my home-brought 100% real Vermont Maple (grade B, thankyouverymuch), and took a bite
FOOD	[ syrup ]	The two plate-sized cakes quickly absorbed the syrup, which made for a delightfully tasty combination
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The pancakes, while substantial, weren't heavy or overwhelming
FOOD	[ buttermilk, syrup ]	 A hint of buttermilk provided just enough "bite" to the syrup
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Mmmmm - definitely a good experience
FOOD	[ bacon ]	But the hidden star was the bacon
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was perfectly cooked; crispy, but slightly chewy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Thick, but not too thick
FOOD	[ balance, salt, fatty ]	 Perfect balance of everything: salt/smoke, thickness/chewiness, and not at all greasy or fatty
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Win
FOOD	[ bacon, coffee ]	The check came - $8 for my meal of cakes, bacon, and coffee
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 Service was excellent - the waitress was quick on the coffee fills, made sure my food was ok, and promptly delivered the check and my change
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A $4 tip seemed totally fair for such an excellent experience (plus it was a slow Monday)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pat O'Malleys = WIN
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food = 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	25 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Value = 4 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service = 4 stars
FOOD	[ O  ]	MISC = 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	5 stars 
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'd probably avoid this place during the weekend rushes - it would likely fill-up quickly
FOOD	[ O  ]	 But the food, service, and environment are all top notch, so any wait is well worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Do yourself (and your tastebuds) a favor and visit the fine folks at Pat O'Malley's Jet Room - you'll be glad you did
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's not the amazing gem as I was hoping, but don't let me knock it that this place is cool
FOOD	[ O  ]	Basically, it's a diner in a commuter airport on the outskirts of Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	If that sounds like your thing, check it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Food was three stars, but it was solid diner food
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices are weird amounts like $8
FOOD	[ O  ]	54 to account for tax
FOOD	[ O  ]	Hilarious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Gets busy on Sunday mornings!Hard to find a good $100 burger (airport restaurant)
FOOD	[ BLT, ice, tea ]	Had an awesome BLT with great service and an ice tea for $10
FOOD	[ O  ]	90 plus tip
FOOD	[ O  ]	Place really hops at lunch time, for good reason
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not as good overall as I had expected
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pretty average basic breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	OK service
FOOD	[ O  ]	Enjoyed "aviation location"
FOOD	[ breakfast food ]	This is just another diner with good breakfast food
FOOD	[ O  ]	The real value is the view
FOOD	[ O  ]	This diner sits right along the runway of a small airport
FOOD	[ Chili, Cheese, hash browns ]	I ordered the Chili Cheese omelet w/ hash browns
FOOD	[ cheese, hash browns ]	I recommend paying the upcharge to get cheese and peppers tossed into your hash browns
FOOD	[ O  ]	I loved the view and would go back the next time I'm in Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	Short review
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of the top five breakfast joints in Madison, and I've been to ALL of them
FOOD	[ coffee ]	Excellent food and coffee, and the view isn't bad either
FOOD	[ O  ]	breakfast rocks here! do it!This place was a bit of a surprise
FOOD	[ O  ]	We flew into Madison and were starving
FOOD	[ O  ]	We always rely on Yelp when we travel, it was close and this place did not disappoint
FOOD	[ O  ]	It is inside a flight services building but the place is really clean and a nice view of the runway
FOOD	[ fish, sandwich ]	I had the BLTCE and my wife had the flying fish sandwich and both were really good
FOOD	[ O  ]	We will be back, check it out
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great morning breakfast spot
FOOD	[ O  ]	Take the kids, they love watching the planes
FOOD	[ O  ]	Unique place that is, as Steve said, a little off the beaten path
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Pat O'Malley's Jet Room is a pretty no-frills breakfast place (they offer lunch as well) serving up some good diner grub
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Bonus feature: You can watch planes take off and land while you're chowin' down
FOOD	[ O  ]	Out of all the diners in Madison that I've been to, the Jet Room service is the best; seriously top-notch
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Pat or his wife have been hosting every time I've gone (and have even remembered my name when I went a couple weekends in a row), the staff are friendly and always on top of things
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I get a pretty good mom 'n pop type vibe from here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've never had a problem with the food here

FOOD	[ Biscuits ]	"B-B-B-Biscuits!" YesssssThe Jet Room and some decent dinner food
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a great place for a breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	But honestly I don't go to the Jet Room for the food
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's the view that keeps me coming back
FOOD	[ eggs, salmon, tenderloin ]	best eggs benidict in the area from the traditional to salmon ,crabcakes even vegitarian version  tenderloin special all excellent do a great job on
FOOD	[ eggs, corned beef, club sandwich ]	all breakfast from omletes to skilets to eggs corned beef hash pancakes only had lunch here once very good burger and club sandwich kids love watching the planes come and go always have had excellent service excellent food at reasonable prices can't go wrongWe were in Madison for a wedding and chose Pat O'Learys based off proximity and Yelp reviews
FOOD	[ O  ]	We were so glad we did! We liked it so much we came back the next morning
FOOD	[ O  ]	A unique dining experience being able to see all the small planes and hear the pilot talk among the patrons
FOOD	[ O  ]	And the first day we met both Pat and Pam as we were checking out, they were both so nice and shared stories with us about the small airport
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is classic diner fare, and doesn't disappoint
FOOD	[ O  ]	Definitively recommend this place for both the food and the experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	Great diner with the added benefit of being able to see planes land and take off!
FOOD	[ O  ]	Went for breakfast on a Saturday morning
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a bit of drive from the West Side, but worth it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices are reasonable and portions are generous
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service was great
FOOD	[ O  ]	Typical diner food, but all the prices are plane model numbers, which ads to the experience a bit I think
FOOD	[ O  ]	Best part are the giant windows that let you see the private terminal tarmac of the Dane County Regional Airport
FOOD	[ O  ]	We saw three or four planes land, taxi and take off during our hour meal
FOOD	[ O  ]	Did you know that J
FOOD	[ stage ]	Pat O'Malley provided voice acting for many classic Disney films in the 1950s & 60s, including Alice in Wonderland, One Hundred and One Dalmatians, and The Jungle Book? He was also lauded for his character acting both on the Broadway stage and American TV/film after moving from his native England
FOOD	[ O  ]	As far as I know, the gentleman referenced above has absolutely no connection to one of the best named restaurants out there: Pat O'Malley's Jet Room
FOOD	[ brunch, skillet, beans, beans ]	Any breakfast/brunch venue with a high quality skillet gets my beans a'boiling, and POMJR definitely boils my beans
FOOD	[ O  ]	Add in the potential entertainment value of witnessing airway disaster at any time and you have a recipe for a high quality morning that would make J
FOOD	[ O  ]	Pat O'Malley proud
FOOD	[ O  ]	Minus one star for no booze or high quality bloody (that I can recall)Newer diner (was expecting older) with great service with a neat view
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Food was very delicious but it's hard to swallow the price tags
FOOD	[ O  ]	 $9
FOOD	[ BLT, sandwich ]	50 for a BLT sandwich?  I guess you're paying for the view, which is kind of cool but I'd rather not pay double
FOOD	[ O  ]	Was passing through - I live in Chicago where I understand get establishments and you pay $$$ but didn't think I'd see it Wisconsin
FOOD	[ O  ]	  Eat there once when you're feeling rich
FOOD	[ O  ]	 We loved all the old pics on the wall and the original "Restaurant" sign hanging (vintage neon)
FOOD	[ O  ]	Shannon gave us excellent service!Grade: C
FOOD	[ O  ]	Loud
FOOD	[ O  ]	Cheap
FOOD	[ O  ]	Okay overall
FOOD	[ O  ]	They have an acoustics problem here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It's horribly loud in there, and everything feels rushed and crushed together
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	 I had some vegetarian sandwich, it was mediocre and gave me heartburn supreme
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Blah
FOOD	[ O  ]	Also there was an article on MSNBC that revealed that Panera uses additives in their bakery items that cause hyper activity in young children
FOOD	[ O  ]	So if you are looking for a place that's crowded, loud, has mediocre food and pocked with spastic, hyper active children who will gnaw on your leg, go here
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good food but odd that they lost my lunch order
FOOD	[ O  ]	Thanks to those manning the counter who realized I was waiting and filled the order on the spot
FOOD	[ sandwich ]	saw a fly dancing on my sandwich when waiting for my order, they don't bother to pay attention anyway since there are quite a lot customers , awful awful place even though i have very good experience with other panera breadThis Panera would have gotten 5 stars a few years ago when I practically lived there the month I was finishing up my grad school portfolio
FOOD	[ pastry ]	But those lovely leather armchairs that I so loved so sit with a drink and a pastry are now gone
FOOD	[ O  ]	Lounging around all day is no longer encouraged, it would seem
FOOD	[ O  ]	That being said, this Panera is still a pretty great one
FOOD	[ O  ]	Quick service, friendly faces, always clean
FOOD	[ soup, bread, bowl ]	You really can't go wrong with soup in a bread bowl
FOOD	[ dough, bread ]	Love the sour dough bread
FOOD	[ cheese ]	they make great grilled cheese

FOOD	[ bagel, asiago, cheese, cream cheese ]	My favorite bagel is a fresh asiago cheese with tons of cream cheese
FOOD	[ broccoli, cheese, soup ]	Yum!  The broccoli cheese soup is also very tasty
FOOD	[ eggs, chicken ]	 I love that they have cage free eggs and antibac free chicken
FOOD	[ O  ]	I appreciate that they are starting to care more about the products they are serving
FOOD	[ O  ]	The only question I have is this
FOOD	[ chickens, free range ]	are the chickens free range? 
FOOD	[ O  ]	This Panera is rather loud and always busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good foodI called to order my lunch, the lady put me on 'hold' or mute for 5 minutes
FOOD	[ O  ]	she was kinda sassy but besides that the people there are really nice and the food is excellent
FOOD	[ bagel, cream cheese, sandwich, coffee ]	Not too loud or busy after 1 ishI came here with my girlfriend for breakfast, I had a bagel with cream cheese and she had a breakfast sandwich and we both got coffee drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food was made  quickly but we had to wait almost ten minutes for our drinks to be made  but the staff was friendly and the food was really goodCome to this location Monday thru Friday between 9am and 11am and it's dead, my favorite time to go
FOOD	[ O  ]	Old school greasy spoon food and very nice service
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a throwback to another time and a good one at that

FOOD	[ O  ]	Down to earth and delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	If I lived here I would def b a regular!Awesome breakfast!This is definitely a throw-back to little town diners
FOOD	[ O  ]	The food is basic, but well made and cheap
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really cheap
FOOD	[ O  ]	Nothing over $8 on the menu and most things in the $5-6 range for breakfast which is served all day
FOOD	[ coffee ]	I recently went here on a weekday morning that I had off work and the place was mostly filled with older guys sitting around in groups drinking their coffee discussing the weekend football games
FOOD	[ chat ]	You can tell this is the type of place that people visit every day to chat with neighbors and have the community feeling
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service is prompt and efficient
FOOD	[ O  ]	On weekends there can be a short wait, but never anything too bad
FOOD	[ O  ]	what a great place
FOOD	[ O  ]	the owner is very friendly, food awesome, and good value:  we will def
FOOD	[ O  ]	return!I want to give this dump a big fat 0
FOOD	[ O  ]	My mother and I went this past weekend very hopeful that the food would be good based on the fact they won Best in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	How on earth did this place win any award for great food and service is beyond me
FOOD	[ coffee ]	The menu was extremely old, small and the coffee was pure water
FOOD	[ hash browns, eggs ]	I order the walleye, hash browns, toast and eggs breakfast
FOOD	[ biscuits, gravy ]	My mother order biscuits and gravy
FOOD	[ hash browns, eggs, fish ]	My toast was cold, hash browns had no tastes, over easy eggs were not cooked fully and fish was very small in size
FOOD	[ gravy ]	Mothers gravy was too salty and a thick bunch of sop
FOOD	[ O  ]	The menu had no coordination
FOOD	[ Biscuit, gravy, hash browns ]	Biscuit,gravy and hash browns? That is nothing but starch!
FOOD	[ O  ]	With that aside,
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not only that but the server was horrible
FOOD	[ O  ]	I felt like she ignored my mother and I the entire time
FOOD	[ O  ]	I understand they were kinda busy
FOOD	[ O  ]	Fine
FOOD	[ O  ]	We can be patient
FOOD	[ O  ]	However, she refilled coffees at her other tables and stopped by to tell the customers their food was being made after waiting for so long
FOOD	[ O  ]	We did not receive such treatment
FOOD	[ O  ]	She passed our table several times and never once asked us how was the food or why our orders were taking so long
FOOD	[ O  ]	Not once
FOOD	[ O  ]	 She was a horrible waitress
FOOD	[ O  ]	Neither my mother or I could finish our food
FOOD	[ O  ]	I took possibly 4 bites and was done
FOOD	[ O  ]	We spent less time eating then we did waiting and ordering
FOOD	[ O  ]	Waitress continued to ignore us, so we got up and just walked over to pay
FOOD	[ O  ]	I told the cashier the food was horrible and I wouldn't be back
FOOD	[ O  ]	She then stated to us that normally the food is good and she wasn't sure why it was taking the kitchen so long and were getting orders wrong
FOOD	[ O  ]	But here is the killer
FOOD	[ O  ]	she then leans over and says " I hate our kitchen staff, we need new ones"
FOOD	[ O  ]	What kind of place does that? You do no throw your co workers under the bus TO CUSTOMERS! I was beyond flabbergasted
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just a horrible business, not friendly and food is beyond pathetic
FOOD	[ O  ]	Do not go here
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have no idea who in their right mind would vote them as "Best in Madison" or give it 5 stars unless you do not have taste buds
FOOD	[ coffee, Pancake ]	If you want great food, coffee AND service, go to The Original Pancake House in Monona
FOOD	[ O  ]	Came here a few times and always had really good food and friendly service! Thanks again!I think I just fell in love
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I loooove breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Love it
FOOD	[ menus ]	 Sometimes, I get really overwhelmed by large, fancy menus
FOOD	[ Cafe ]	 So you can imagine, what a breath of fresh air, the Cottage Cafe was
FOOD	[ O  ]	We walked in at 9 am
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Early, but not too early
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The place was packed
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Wow
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I walked up to the register and little did I know, but it is a seat yourself place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There was no sign
FOOD	[ O  ]	 So we waited a few minutes for a table to open and sat down
FOOD	[ biscuits, gravy, eggs ]	I am a simple person, I ordered the special of biscuits and gravy with two eggs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The menu had quite a few other options
FOOD	[ steak, eggs, hash browns ]	 My husband ordered the steak, two eggs and hash browns
FOOD	[ O  ]	 $8
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is probably the most expensive item on their menu
FOOD	[ gravy ]	My gravy was perfect
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was thick without being sludgy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It had the right amount of seasoning
FOOD	[ biscuits, gravy ]	 I received my breakfast on two plates because the biscuits and gravy were overwhelming a single plate
FOOD	[ scrambled eggs ]	  I ordered scrambled eggs
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They were bland and flat
FOOD	[ omelette ]	 I spied my neighbors omelette which looked much more appetizing
FOOD	[ O  ]	Our whole bill (for two people) was $16 and some change
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 Bottomless coffee and breakfast
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Wow
FOOD	[ O  ]	Oh, parking is tough
FOOD	[ O  ]	 There is only one shared lot
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm a big fan of having breakfast here, so this is a breakfast review
FOOD	[ steak, eggs ]	I enjoy the steak and eggs/ hash brown breakfast
FOOD	[ steak, sirloin ]	Each time I've ordered this, the steak it a great breakfast sized sirloin perfectly cooked

FOOD	[ Coffee, Eggs, biscuits, sausage, bacon ]	Coffee, Eggs, biscuits, hash, sausage, bacon, pancakes, toast
FOOD	[ O  ]	The essentials
FOOD	[ cook ]	Who needs anything else when your hungry and want someone else to cook for you on a Sunday morning, right?
FOOD	[ O  ]	Plenty of seating, but a word of warning
FOOD	[ O  ]	I'm not the only person who loves this café
FOOD	[ O  ]	It fills up very quickly on the weekends and you may be waiting for a seat
FOOD	[ O  ]	Service is very good every time
FOOD	[ Coffee ]	Bottomless Coffee just keeps on coming! I love that
FOOD	[ O  ]	The pricing is the best part! Nothing like getting a great plate of food for a more than willing to pay price
FOOD	[ Steak, eggs, hash browns ]	I believe my go to Steak/eggs/hash browns/toast is around $7
FOOD	[ O  ]	99
FOOD	[ O  ]	Ya! Amazing right!
FOOD	[ bucks ]	Between my wife and me, I have not seen our breakfast bill over $17 bucks yet
FOOD	[ coffee ]	including each ordering coffee
FOOD	[ O  ]	So Like I said
FOOD	[ breakfast food ]	Nothing fancy, just great traditional breakfast food at great prices
FOOD	[ Cafe ]	I love breakfast, and at Cottage Cafe, they really get it right
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The food is the biggest hit with lots of basic American breakfast fare options
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Expect to leave stuffed as the portion sizes are pretty big
FOOD	[ coffee ]	 The coffee service is awesome and the whole staff is quite friendly and efficient
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You get all of this at a super reasonable price
FOOD	[ Eggs Benedict, yogurt, fried cheese, curds, root beer ]	Incredible service and amazing food! Eggs Benedict meal was one of the best ones I have had in a long time! Prices are very, very great - fairly inexpensive!First of all, how has no one reviewed Michael's yet?  They have the best everything!  The best frozen yogurt, certainly the best fried cheese curds EVER, and the best root beer
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Michael's is open kind of later than you might expect, and has a nice patio to sit outside in the summer
FOOD	[ custard ]	 They now offer K-9 custard, so you can bring your dog too!  
FOOD	[ ice cream, custard ]	My cat likes ice cream, I wonder if K-9 custard could be good for felines?Thank god Michelle reviewed this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	She's taken me here before and IT RULED but I coudn't remember the name
FOOD	[ O  ]	I wish we had a place like Michael's even half as good in Minneapolis
FOOD	[ custard, butter ]	Every single time I have frozen custard it tastes like butter and, while some may find that awesome, it happens to make my gag reflex go crazy
FOOD	[ custard, root beer ]	The custard at Michael's is pretty much perfect and the root beer is SO good
FOOD	[ root beer ]	I don't even like root beer that much but I would drink this stuff every day if I could
FOOD	[ custard ]	I'm sure I'd love the K-9 custard, too
FOOD	[ half and half, custard ]	Who cares, I'm sure it's ten times better than the solid half and half a lot of places are trying to pass off as custard around here
FOOD	[ O  ]	i cannot believe that no one had yelped this place- thank you jaymi and michelle, you are geniuses
FOOD	[ O  ]	my friends from madison visiting a couple weeks ago told me that michaels is  just as it was when i was there maybe 8 years ago so this review should be accurate
FOOD	[ O  ]	one word sums it up
FOOD	[ O  ]	PERFECTION
FOOD	[ O  ]	they also told me they dont go often, or at least every day, which i would
FOOD	[ O  ]	you would be beyond obese but it would be worth it
FOOD	[ custard ]	i have only had the frozen custard here and being lactose intolerant but in denial makes it a rough experience
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	there is nothing like this in the world- italian gelati, nopee, argentine ice cream del dios, cant touch this shit
FOOD	[ custard ]	michaels frozen custard is literally the best taste sensation i have experienced in my life
FOOD	[ O  ]	that is a big statement and im owning it
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 it doesnt even matter what flavor you get, its that good
FOOD	[ peanut butter ]	you dont even have to get toppings on it- though i would toss some peanut butter cup chunks on
FOOD	[ O  ]	could be worth the drive to madison alone
FOOD	[ O  ]	First of all, this is not the original location
FOOD	[ O  ]	that's why you see so few reviews here on the Atwood store
FOOD	[ custard ]	However, they still have the cute umbrellas and the luscious custard we all love
FOOD	[ custard, sundaes, fried cheese, curds ]	Stopped in to get a fix and killed two birds with one stone -- delicious frozen custard sundaes and hot fried cheese curds
FOOD	[ O  ]	Could it get any better? Only if you made the entry way and the outdoor tables more accessible for friends and family in wheelchairs, and your servers a little friendlier and better
FOOD	[ O  ]	We sat outside in the sunshine and watched everybody drive by and stare back at us jealously
FOOD	[ Chocolate ]	I had Death By Chocolate
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Now I am dead and loving it
FOOD	[ turtle, custard, fudge, caramel, pecans, cherry ]	Each trip home I need, need to stop by here  for the requisite small turtle sundae: its melty eggshell-white frozen custard, hot fudge, caramel, a pile of pecans and cherry on top makes my day
FOOD	[ O  ]	Or my year
FOOD	[ O  ]	Take a pint to-go, too
FOOD	[ pumpkin, custard ]	I'm currently dreaming about their pumpkin custard
FOOD	[ O  ]	Mmm
FOOD	[ Cheddar ]	Cheddar burger, check
FOOD	[ O  ]	Vanilla shake, check
FOOD	[ fries, custard ]	Food coma, double check!!! This place is old school burgers, fries and shakes; and they are good at what they do!The custard is really fantastic - creamy - the best
FOOD	[ O  ]	 The other food, though, is notably disappointing
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I've had a couple of burgers there and they were greasy and half-hearted concoctions
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I also think that the counter staff could be a lot better
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They always seem sullen and taciturn
FOOD	[ O  ]	 In the winter you get the impression that they aren't really even supposed to be open
FOOD	[ O  ]	 That is all a shame, though, because the interior is decent - 50's diner style - and they could surely draw in a very decent off-season crowd if they chose to work on the food and the staff's comportment
FOOD	[ custard, flavor ]	Go for the custard, and if you are doing drive through and want the flavor of the day, be sure to ask for it fresh
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was sure Culver's just down the way would drive a stake through Michael's when it opened a few years back, but it hasn't happened
FOOD	[ O  ]	For those of us who like the real thing, that's something to be happy about
FOOD	[ O  ]	I've been happy with their veggie burgers and can't complain about the food over all
FOOD	[ O  ]	Drive in kinda food
FOOD	[ custard ]	Being from out of state, I'm not a custard expert
FOOD	[ O  ]	 However, even an idiot knows that this place is good after just one taste
FOOD	[ flavor ]	I enjoyed the black forest flavor of the day
FOOD	[ chocolate ]	 Creamy chocolate and cherries
FOOD	[ grassy ]	Make sure to walk through the back parking lot, through the grassy area and down to the lake to enjoy your treat
FOOD	[ O  ]	Better than Culvers
FOOD	[ O  ]	But more expensive
FOOD	[ custard ]	If you stop eating frozen custard for a while and then go back to it, you  wish you never tried it again
FOOD	[ malt ]	 After a few years frequenting this place, the Oreo malt is the only thing I consider ordering
FOOD	[ O  ]	And that is only if someone I'm with really wants to go and is paying for it
FOOD	[ O  ]	Prices are obscene
FOOD	[ O  ]	All of the food is greasy, bland, and expensive
FOOD	[ O  ]	Good, wisconsin-esque experience
FOOD	[ mint, cookie, dough ]	 The flavors of the day, mint oreo, then cookie dough, were just ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Would go back, unless I found someplace better
FOOD	[ O  ]	I was there on a hot Sat in June
FOOD	[ O  ]	 They had one clerk and some other guy learning over try to hear the order
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Shouldn't the outside order window be opened
FOOD	[ fries, onion rings, curds ]	 I order the basket and the clerk specifically asked me for fries, onion rings, and cheez curds
FOOD	[ onion ]	 What I ended up in my basket were onion petals
FOOD	[ O  ]	 These aren't rings( they used to serve rings)but that's not what I got
FOOD	[ O  ]	I got about 10 and they used to serve big portions
FOOD	[ choice ]	 This location didn't have fountain drinks and had the choice of soda in a can
FOOD	[ O  ]	They used to have fountain drinks
FOOD	[ O  ]	Finally, the last thing that made mad as a wet wasp is the prices listed are cash prices
FOOD	[ O  ]	If use a credit card you pay 3% more
FOOD	[ flavor ]	A flavor OF THE DAY(fod) is about 3
FOOD	[ O  ]	70 while a whole pint is about 4
FOOD	[ O  ]	99
FOOD	[ O  ]	 You can always get the FOD in a pint so I would go with a whole pint
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Basket are about 5
FOOD	[ O  ]	99 to 6
FOOD	[ O  ]	70 but bring your cash or add 3% to the already absorbent prices
FOOD	[ custard ]	The best frozen custard!
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's very smooth and creamy though a bit sweet
FOOD	[ O  ]	Every time I go to Madison, I need to stop here for some creamy frozen treat
FOOD	[ chocolate, pecan ]	The chocolate pecan is my favorite
FOOD	[ O  ]	I like this place
FOOD	[ custard ]	 Nothing super special, but still one of the best custard places in town
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	 I always get dog ice cream for my pups
FOOD	[ custard ]	I'm a frozen custard novice, so maybe i'll revise this after I've tried some other places
FOOD	[ O  ]	We came here at about 9:30 on a Thursday night and it was pretty dead
FOOD	[ ice cream, deer ]	I think we were expecting a normal ice cream shop kind of atmosphere, with a big case of flavors to look at, so we had a bit of a deer-in-headlights moment when we first walked in, trying to figure out what we were supposed to order
FOOD	[ chocolate ]	It turns out they only have 3 flavors (vanilla, chocolate, and one other) per day, and most of your choices come from what sort of sundae you get
FOOD	[ O  ]	Once we figured that out, a number of the sundae choices seemed pretty solid
FOOD	[ Turtle, Peanut Butter ]	I ended up going with Turtle, and my husband got the Peanut Butter Cup
FOOD	[ O  ]	Both were excellent
FOOD	[ chocolate, pecans, Turtle ]	The chocolate shell on the PBC was nicely chocolaty, especially for that kind of a product, and I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the pecans for the Turtle
FOOD	[ O  ]	We both had smalls, which were QUITE ample
FOOD	[ custard ]	We also got a K9 custard for our dog, which she appeared to enjoy
FOOD	[ O  ]	I guess I just have a couple of objections that keep this from being a 4-star place
FOOD	[ custard ]	First, I wish they had more flavors, since I don't always want a sundae (but maybe this is characteristic of frozen custard joints and is not a fair criticism)
FOOD	[ melt, fudge ]	Second, I think it should be served slightly colder so that it doesn't melt as fast when the hot fudge hits it
FOOD	[ fast food ]	Third, I felt that it was a bit overpriced for a fast food-style place
FOOD	[ custard ]	This is especially true of the K9 custard, since we're used to getting something more along the lines of a 79-cent kiddie cone for the dog
FOOD	[ dessert ]	We'll probably be back, since its in the neighborhood, but this will not be the last frozen dessert purveyor I visit in Madison
FOOD	[ O  ]	Stick with Culvers!  My family and I stopped by on our way biking around the lake
FOOD	[ O  ]	What a rude and disappointing experience
FOOD	[ O  ]	First of all the staff who waited on us, Andrea was short tempered and not into customer service
FOOD	[ O  ]	We tried to order swirl, but they don't have it, we had to come up with a solution, Andrea just said no
FOOD	[ O  ]	We ordered a cone, small sundae and a can of coke
FOOD	[ O  ]	About $10
FOOD	[ glass, ice ]	00 later, I was grudging given a glass filled about 1/3 full of ice for my not very chilled coke
FOOD	[ custard ]	The custard is ok, but nothing special
FOOD	[ O  ]	Another option would to be to continue on the bike path
FOOD	[ ice cream ]	In Monona there is an ice cream stop by a park on the lake
FOOD	[ O  ]	We will try that next time
FOOD	[ O  ]	For all the hype, Michael's is quite a disappointment
FOOD	[ custard ]	Maybe it's because I didn't try the custard
FOOD	[ O  ]	But seriously, I didn't need more weighing down in this weather
FOOD	[ crush ]	so I ordered an orange crush float instead
FOOD	[ O  ]	For something that would have cost me MAYBE 50cents to make at home, I paid close to $5 for a 12oz cup
FOOD	[ O  ]	That is ridiculous
FOOD	[ O  ]	In general, I think their prices are pretty steep for what you get
FOOD	[ bang, buck ]	you'd probably have to order a burger to really get a bang for your buck
FOOD	[ O  ]	Like RB, I also had an issue with the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	It was slow, disorganized, and not very friendly
FOOD	[ O  ]	The line was almost out the door, but the employees behind the counter didn't even ATTEMPT to speed up the service
FOOD	[ O  ]	One of them just disappeared into a back room
FOOD	[ O  ]	tsktsk
FOOD	[ O  ]	I also thought it was hilarious how one of the employees crumpled up an order form before the order had been completed, and then had to UNcrumple the paper so she could re-read the order to her coworker
FOOD	[ O  ]	Really? 
FOOD	[ O  ]	Anyway, I will probably give the Monroe St
FOOD	[ O  ]	Michael's - and their custards/burgers - a shot, but I'm not going to get my hopes up
FOOD	[ O  ]	This was my first visit
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I love the interior decoration of this place
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Clean
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Had a really yummy sundae
FOOD	[ O  ]	 A bit pricey though
FOOD	[ custard ]	Great custard, fresh toppings, overall its amazing
FOOD	[ O  ]	$$$ though
FOOD	[ chocolate ]	I paid $4 for a chocolate shake and it was not even that big
FOOD	[ O  ]	A cheaper alternative, obviously Culvers
FOOD	[ O  ]	I would still recommend Michaels though
FOOD	[ O  ]	Just had the worst tasting greasy cheesburger I have ever had
FOOD	[ french fries ]	 Served with about 5 french fries
FOOD	[ O  ]	In Madison to watch some club soccer at the park down the road
FOOD	[ belly ]	Skipped breakfast and needed to fill my belly with some lip lickin food that comes fast
FOOD	[ O  ]	Michael's looked like a gimmick, but was the closest place I could find
FOOD	[ O  ]	They're going for a 50s nostalgia drive-thru and for the most part it works! I recommend going inside to also taste the retro ambiance
FOOD	[ fast food ]	Food? Happy to report significantly better than your average fast food joint
FOOD	[ bacon, cheeseburger, grill, grease ]	My bacon cheeseburger was dripping with just off the grill grease
FOOD	[ O  ]	It's a quality burger with fresh veggies to boot
FOOD	[ fries ]	And you won't find fries like this even at a sitdown restaurant
FOOD	[ O  ]	Holy delicious
FOOD	[ O  ]	Next time I'll try the shake
FOOD	[ O  ]	Please do not ever go here
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is a public service announcement
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I do not even know you and I like you too much to suggest this place
FOOD	[ milkshake ]	1- Prices?!  Are you kidding me?  $6 for a milkshake?  It was tiny
FOOD	[ milkshake ]	 Not to mention it was not much of a milkshake
FOOD	[ peanut butter ]	 It was a peanut butter cup shake
FOOD	[ peanut butter, cups, custard, milk ]	 They took some peanut butter cups, crushed them and stirred them into custard with some milk
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I saw the whole process
FOOD	[ O  ]	 It was not very impressive whatsoever
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 The flavor was ok
FOOD	[ O  ]	2 - The food
FOOD	[ chili, cheese ]	 I had a chili cheese dog
FOOD	[ O  ]	 This is my standard order when it is available on the menu
FOOD	[ chili ]	 The chili tasted like Hormel
FOOD	[ hot dog, chili ]	 The hot dog was hot and the chili was warm
FOOD	[ cheese, liquid, cheese ]	 I like that they have shredded cheese on it, rather than liquid cheese
FOOD	[ O  ]	3 - My dining companion got a burger
FOOD	[ patty ]	 It tasted ok, but it was a very thing patty
FOOD	[ cheese, curds ]	He also ordered cheese curds with it
FOOD	[ flavor ]	 They were so greasy and lacked any good flavor in the breading
FOOD	[ O  ]	Overall, we spent nearly $20 there and I was not satisfied with my meal
FOOD	[ custard ]	 Every talks so much about how great the custard is
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Nope
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Not good
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Go to Culver's!  Seriously, for $6 you can get something TWICE the size with more mix-ins
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Better yet?  Get a cone for you AND a friend
FOOD	[ O  ]	A freezer full of titles that need to be decoded!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I asked the counter guy the tough questions: 
FOOD	[ bear, elephant ]	"What's the difference between bear claw, elephant trax, and badger trax?"
FOOD	[ elephant ]	I can't remember what the difference was other than that elephant trax sounded the best
FOOD	[ caramel, chocolate, custard, peanut butter, cups ]	 I didn't want to risk ending my day with artificial caramel, so chose the chocolate custard with peanut butter cups
FOOD	[ O  ]	Perhaps a little steep at upwards of $5 per pint, but hey, it's not much more expensive than regular-price Haagen-Dazs or Ben&Jerry's is getting these days, and I think it's at least on par, plus it's freshly made!Michael's has been around forever
FOOD	[ sundaes ]	I've eaten more sundaes here than I care to admit
FOOD	[ O  ]	 And, without fail, they are good
FOOD	[ O  ]	Every
FOOD	[ O  ]	Single
FOOD	[ O  ]	Time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes, they are a bit pricey
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Yes, they may be small for what you get
FOOD	[ O  ]	Yes they are all pretty similar
FOOD	[ O  ]	But darn it
FOOD	[ O  ]	They are so stinkin' good
FOOD	[ melt, custard, melt, ice cream ]	 Just eat them before they melt, because gosh does custard melt faster than ice cream!!
FOOD	[ O  ]	I have never eaten the "real" food at this location - so I can't comment on that
FOOD	[ sundaes ]	But the sundaes are worth it every time
FOOD	[ O  ]	Note: I have only ordered delivery, and that I've ordered online
FOOD	[ pizza ]	That said, the pizza we've gotten from here has been consistently fresh, hot, and tasty
FOOD	[ dough ]	I think there's only been one time that I was disappointed with the consistency of the dough, hence three stars instead of four
FOOD	[ Pizza, pizza ]	Craving a thin crust Pizza Hut pizza last night I called this place at 8PM for a delivery
FOOD	[ pizza, pizza ]	They were out of pizza,yes out of thin crust pizza
FOOD	[ hung ]	I said that's like McDonalds being out of cheeseburgers,and was hung up on!? Unbelievable!In a world where money buys you food--why would you come here and buy cardboard?  
FOOD	[ Pizza ]	Pizza Hut in general has gone downhill so far, it's not even funny
FOOD	[ Pizza ]	 I remember when I was a kid in the early 80's, Pizza Hut was awesome
FOOD	[ O  ]	 Now, it's all horrible
FOOD	[ Cheese sticks, pizza ]	Cheese sticks were under cooked, the pizza was EXTREMELY greasy
FOOD	[ O  ]	 I mean, oil was literally dripping out of the crust
FOOD	[ O  ]	Gross
FOOD	[ O  ]	It also had kind of a funky aftertaste
FOOD	[ O  ]	Wings were okay
FOOD	[ pizza, pizza, bucks ]	With so many options for good pizza in town, there is pretty much no reason to eat at pizza hut, even if it does save you a few bucks
FOOD	[ O  ]	Boo-urns
