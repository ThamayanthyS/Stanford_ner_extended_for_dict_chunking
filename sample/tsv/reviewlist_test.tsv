Green	FOOD

was	O
the	O
first	O
one	O
that	O
we	O
hit	O
up	O
.	O
Driving	O
up	O
the	O

looked	O
kind	O
of	O
small	O
and	O
beat	FOOD
up	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
expecting	O

not	O

As	O
we	O
got	O

however	O
I	O
realized	O
how	O
big	O
this	O

was	O
on	O
the	O
inside	O
.	O
It	O
's	O
huge	O
!	O
At	O
least	O
it	O
felt	O
huge	O
from	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
sitting	O
.	O
I	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
article	O
in	O
the	O

that	O
attributed	O
to	O
how	O
crazy	O
busy	O
this	O

was	O
or	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
concert	O
or	O
what	O
but	O
this	O
place	O
was	O
insane	O
.	O
I	O
mean	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
an	O
hour	O
for	O
our	O
table	O
.	O
On	O
the	O
plus	O
side	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
an	O
hour	O
for	O
our	O
table	O
which	O
meant	O
an	O
hour	O
of	O
drinking	O
so	O
I	O
ca	O
n't	O
really	O
complain	O
.	O
Because	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
waiting	O
for	O
so	O
long	O
we	O
also	O
had	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	O

so	O
when	O
we	O
finally	O
sat	O
down	O
we	O
knew	O
exactly	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
;	O
the	O

started	O
with	O
the	O

a	O

too	O

for	O
my	O
liking	O

It	O
can	O
be	O
uncomfortable	O

especially	O
when	O
half	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
turns	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
you	O
when	O
you	O
walk	O
in	O
.	O
Sundays	O
can	O
be	O
the	O
worst	O
.	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
people	O
nearly	O
live	O
there	O

The	O
place	O
is	O
pretty	O
open	O

there	O
is	O
a	O

it	O
still	O
can	O

quite	O
smoky	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
few	O
outdoor	O

along	O
Elmwood	O

these	O
are	O
perfect	O
for	O
a	O

I	O
would	O
probably	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
Hody	O
more	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
n't	O
for	O
the	O
small	O

the	O
slight	O
hostile	O
feeling	O
that	O
I	O
sometimes	O
pick	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
regulars	O

but	O
overall	O
the	O
Hody	O
is	O
a	O
reliably	O
good	O
time.They	O
have	O
decent	O

the	O

the	O

something	O
of	O
an	O

They	O
taste	O
good	O
to	O
me	O
because	O
they	O
bring	O

of	O
the	O
70s	O

They	O
do	O
have	O
good	O

there	O

they	O
need	O
to	O

the	O

we	O
wo	O

be	O
trying	O
any	O

!	O
The	O
first	O
thing	O
that	O

was	O
the	O
great	O

a	O

the	O

my	O

that	O
it	O

We	O
came	O
here	O
at	O
about	O
9:30	O
on	O
a	O
Thursday	O
night	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
dead	O
.	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
were	O
expecting	O
a	O
normal	O
ice	FOOD
cream	FOOD
shop	O
kind	O
of	O
atmosphere	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
big	O
case	O
of	O
flavors	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
deer-in-headlights	FOOD
moment	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
walked	O
in	O
,	O
trying	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
supposed	O
to	O
order	O
.	O
It	O
turns	O
out	O
they	O
only	O
have	O
3	O
flavors	O
-LRB-	O
vanilla	FOOD
,	O
chocolate	FOOD
,	O
and	O
one	O
other	O
-RRB-	O
per	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
your	O
choices	O
come	O
from	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
sundae	FOOD
you	O
get	O
.	O
Once	O
we	O
figured	O
that	O
out	O
,	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
sundae	FOOD
choices	O
seemed	O
pretty	O
solid	O
.	O
I	O
ended	O
up	O
going	O
with	O
Turtle	FOOD
,	O
and	O
my	O
husband	O
got	O
the	O
Peanut	FOOD
Butter	FOOD
Cup	O
.	O
Both	O
were	O
excellent	O
.	O
The	O
chocolate	FOOD
shell	O
on	O
the	O
PBC	O
was	O
nicely	O
chocolaty	O
,	O
especially	O
for	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
product	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
appreciated	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
skimp	O
on	O
the	O
pecans	FOOD
for	O
the	O
Turtle	FOOD
.	O
We	O
both	O
had	O
smalls	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
QUITE	O
ample	O
.	O
We	O
also	O
got	O
a	O
K9	O
custard	FOOD
for	O
our	O
dog	FOOD
,	O
which	O
she	O
appeared	O
to	O
enjoy	O
.	O
I	O
guess	O
I	O
just	O
have	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
objections	O
that	O
keep	O
this	O
from	O
being	O
a	O
4-star	O
place	O
.	O
First	O
,	O
I	O
wish	O
they	O
had	O
more	O
flavors	O
,	O
since	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
always	O
want	O
a	O
sundae	FOOD
-LRB-	O
but	O
maybe	O
this	O
is	O
characteristic	O
of	O
frozen	O
custard	FOOD
joints	O
and	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
fair	O
criticism	O
-RRB-	O
.	O
Second	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
served	O
slightly	O
colder	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
melt	FOOD
as	O
fast	O
when	O
the	O
hot	O
fudge	FOOD
hits	O
it	O
.	O
Third	O
,	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
overpriced	O
for	O
a	O
fast	O
food-style	O
place	O
.	O
This	O
is	O
especially	O
true	O
of	O
the	O
K9	O
custard	FOOD
,	O
since	O
we	O
're	O
used	O
to	O
getting	O
something	O
more	O
along	O
the	O
lines	O
of	O
a	O
79-cent	O
kiddie	O
cone	O
for	O
the	O

We	O
'll	O
probably	O
be	O
back	O

since	O
its	O
in	O

What	O
a	O
rude	O

all	O
the	O

they	O

it	O

we	O
had	O

come	O
up	O
with	O
a	O

,	O
Andrea	O
just	O
said	O
no	O
.	O
We	O
ordered	O
a	O
cone	O
,	O
small	O
sundae	FOOD
and	O
a	O
can	O
of	O
coke	O
.	O
About	O
$	O
10.00	O
later	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
grudging	O
given	O
a	O
glass	FOOD
filled	O
about	O
1/3	O
full	FOOD
of	O
ice	FOOD
for	O
my	O
not	O
very	O

.	O
The	O
custard	FOOD
is	O
ok	O
,	O
but	O
nothing	O
special	O

Another	O
option	O
would	O
to	O
be	O
to	O

there	O
is	O
an	O

We	O
will	O
try	O
that	O
next	O

all	O
the	O
hype	O
,	O
Michael	O
's	O
is	O
quite	O
a	O
disappointment	O
.	O
Maybe	O
it	O
's	O
because	O
I	O
did	O

the	O

But	O
seriously	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
need	O
more	O
weighing	O
down	O
in	O
this	O
weather	O
...	O
so	O
I	O
ordered	O
an	O
orange	FOOD
crush	FOOD
float	O
instead	O
.	O
For	O
something	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
cost	O
me	O
MAYBE	O
50cents	O
to	O
make	O
at	O
home	O
,	O
I	O
paid	O
close	O
to	O
$	O
5	O
for	O
a	O
12oz	O
cup	O
.	O
That	O
is	O
ridiculous	O
.	O
In	O
general	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
their	O
prices	O
are	O
pretty	O
steep	O
for	O
what	O
you	O
get	O
...	O
you	O
'd	O
probably	O
have	O
to	O
order	O
a	O

a	O

your	O

...	O

I	O

an	O

with	O

It	O
was	O
slow	O

not	O
very	O

.	O
The	O

was	O
almost	O

I	O
also	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
hilarious	O
how	O
one	O

the	O

crumpled	O
up	O
an	O

the	O
