the	O
Green	O

I	O
am	O
so	O
deal	O
with	O
it	O
and	O
go	O
there.	O
	O
If	O

	O
The	O

good	O
as	O
I	O
remember.	O
	O
The	O
Eggs Benedict	FOOD
	O
are	O
just	O
delicious	O
and	O
something	O
I	O
could	O
eat	O
every	O
day	O
and	O
they	O
make	O
one	O
hell	O
of	O
a	O
Bloody Mary	FOOD
	O
So	O
if	O
you	O

some	O

	O
The	O

full	O
of	O
regulars	O
drinking	O
cheap	O

.We	O
had	O
dinner	O
at	O
the	O
Beach	O
House	O
on	O
Friday	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
up	O
to	O
northern	O
Wisconsin	O
based	O
on	O
reviews	O
on	O
Yelp.	O
	O
If	O
you	O
are	O
looking	O
for	O
good	O
fish	FOOD
	O
fry	O
the	O
Beach	O
House	O
has	O
it.	O
	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
perch	O
which	O
was	O
great,	O
my	O
bf	O
had	O
the	O
walleye	O
which	O
i	O
think	O
had	O
an	O
even	O
better	O
flavor	FOOD
.	O
	O
The	O
fish	FOOD
	O
They	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
spot	O
on	O
the	O
lake	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O
dumpy	O
little	O
fish	FOOD
	O
shanty.	O
	O
	O
If	O
that	O
is	O
what	O
you	O
are	O
looking	O
for,	O
you	O
will	O
love	O
it.	O
	O
There	O
were	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
locals	O
there	O
having	O
a	O
good	O
time	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
with	O
a	O
group	O
of	O
our	O
friends	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
ok	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
beers.	O
	O
But	O
still	O
way	O
way	O
too	O
crowded.	O
	O
Like	O
sardines	FOOD
There	O
was	O
no	O
one	O
to	O
greet	O
us	O
so	O
we	O
just	O
took	O
a	O
table	O
by	O
the	O
window.	O
	O
	O
Then	O
we	O
waited	O
and	O
waited.	O
	O
Then	O
someone	O
came	O
over	O
and	O
said	O
hi.	O
	O
Then	O
we	O
waited	O
and	O
waited.	O
	O
I	O
was	O
about	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
and	O
leave	O
when	O
someone	O
came	O
over	O
and	O
said,	O
"oh,	O
you	O
haven't	O
been	O
waited	O
on	O
yet?"	O
	O
So	O
she	O
then	O
tried	O
to	O
help	O
things	O
along.	O
The	O
menu	O
was	O
average	O
for	O
sandwiches	FOOD
	O
but	O
overpriced,	O
we	O
felt,	O
for	O
entrees	O
as	O
we	O
ordered	O
the	O
Ahi	FOOD
	O
Tuna	FOOD
	O
and	O
the	O
Bluegill.	O
	O
	O
The	O
Tuna	FOOD
	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
perhaps	O
appropriately	O
priced	O
but	O
the	O
Bluegill	O
was	O
not	O
proportionately	O
enough.	O
	O
It	O
was	O
made	O
well	O
enough	O
and	O
had	O
ok	O
flavor	FOOD
Salad	FOOD
	O
was	O
ok.	O
	O
At	O
least	O
had	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
greens	FOOD
If	O
I	O
ever	O
went	O
back	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
beers	O
and	O
the	O
view,	O
that's	O
it.	O
It's	O
too	O
bad	O
because	O
we	O
really	O
need	O
some	O
nice	O
places	O
on	O
the	O
lake	O
and	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
lakes	O
around	O
here	O
there	O
aren't	O
as	O
many	O
lakeside	O
restaurants	O
as	O
you	O
would	O
expect.This	O
is	O
the	O
quintessential	O
mom	O

restaurant	O
on	O
a	O

They	O

	O
We	O
went	O
for	O
a	O
Friday	O

	O

excellent,	O
the	O

too.	O
We	O
made	O
reservations	O
and	O
the	O
table	O
was	O
ready	O
well	O
ahead	O
of	O
time.	O
Our	O
one	O
tactical	O
error	O
was	O
sitting	O
in	O
the	O
bar	O
for	O
the	O
view.	O
It	O
was	O
LOUD!	O
Think	O
that	O
the	O
dining	O
room	O
is	O
much	O
quieter.	O
	O
Notice	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
not	O

I	O
drove	O
a	O

to	O

so	O
that	O
in	O

of	O
it	O

should	O
say	O
something.	O
(another	O
caveat:	O
there	O
are	O
maybe	O
six	O
restaurants	O
in	O
McFarland	O
that	O

	O

Now	O
I	O

well	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
number	O
of	O

that	O
a	O
whole	O

cannot	O
in	O
any	O
way	O
hold	O
the	O
Beach	O
House	O
responsible	O
for	O
that.	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
breading	O
was	O
perfectly	O
crispy	O
and	O
well	O
seasoned	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
fish	FOOD
	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
over	O
cooked,	O
nice	O
and	O
moist.	O
plus	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
cost	O
$10	O
which	O
was	O
awesome	O
(you	O

	O
For	O
me	O
the	O

the	O

	O
We	O

There	O

I	O

the	O

they	O
were	O
overcooked,	O

also	O
cold.	O
It	O
took	O
me	O
at	O
least	O
15	O
minutes	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
waitress	O
to	O
ask	O
if	O
I	O

She	O
said	O
that	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
the	O

make	O
up	O
a	O
new	O
meal,	O
and	O
about	O
15	O
minutes	O
later	O

returned	O

my	O

The	O

	O
I	O

	O

Went	O

15.	O
	O
Mom	O
was	O

we	O
got	O
the	O

one).	O
	O
It	O
was	O
more	O

some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O

food	O
in	O
Madison.	O
	O
A	O
little	O
pricey	O

a	O
few	O

	O
always	O
feeds	O
me	O
for	O

two	O

meals.Imperial	O
Garden	O
has	O
been	O
around	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
and	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
local	O
favorite.	O
That	O
struck	O
me	O
as	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
sign	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
Madison	O
almost	O
20	O
years	O
ago,	O
and	O
that	O
continues	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
case.	O
The	O
food	O
is	O
insipid,	O
blandly	O
spiced	O
to	O
appeal	O
to	O
unadventurous	O
midwestern	O
tastes	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
menu	O
reminiscent	O
of	O
the	O
Americanized	O
Chinese	O
palaces	O
of	O
the	O
1950s.	O
I	O
end	O
up	O
there	O
with	O
various	O
groups	O
on	O
occasion,	O
but	O
try	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
to	O
no	O
more	O
frequent	O
than	O
once	O
every	O
five	O
years	O
(more	O
frequently	O
in	O
my	O
first	O
years	O
in	O
Madison,	O
less	O
so	O
now).	O
It's	O
not	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
vastly	O
superior	O
authentic	O
Chinese	O
options	O
(although	O
I	O
prefer	O
P.	O
F.	O
Chang	FOOD
's,	O
recognizing	O
its	O
limitations),	O
but	O
one	O
does	O
better	O
with	O
other	O
Asian	O
options	O
when	O
in	O
Madison--particularly	O
Thai/Laotian,	O
but	O
also	O
Indian	FOOD
	O
(with	O
many	O
new	O
options	O
in	O
recent	O
years).It's	O
perhaps	O
the	O
closest	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
to	O
authetic	O
Chinese	O
food	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
like	O
Madison,	O
particularly	O
after	O
China	FOOD
	O
My	O
real	O
problem	O
with	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
the	O
service:	O
The	O
menu	O
was	O
misinforming	O
and	O
didn't	O
specify	O
that	O
some	O
steamed	O
fish dish	FOOD
	O
was	O
a	O
filet	FOOD
	O
as	O
opposed	O
to	O
a	O
whole	O
fish	FOOD
.	O
I	O
politely	O
complained	O
to	O
the	O
waitress	O
about	O
my	O
order	O
not	O
being	O
accurate	O
and	O
she	O
informed	O
her	O
manager.	O
The	O
manager	O
only	O
ended	O
up	O
refunding	O
me	O
50%	O
off	O
the	O
item	O
ordered	O
and	O
began	O
telling	O
me	O
how	O
you	O
wouldn't	O
refund	O
someone	O
a	O
fancy	O
steak	FOOD
	O
In	O
the	O
end,	O
I	O
paid	O
for	O
my	O
meal	O
and	O
tipped	O
the	O
poor	O
waitress,	O
but	O
I	O
will	O
never	O
visit	O
this	O
place	O
again.	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
that	O
manager	O
woman	O
was	O
giving	O
me	O
a	O
hard	O
time	O
because	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
young	O
college	O
student	O
or	O
what,	O
but	O
her	O
management	O
skills	O
leave	O
much	O
to	O
be	O
desired.This	O
was,	O
quite	O
possibly,	O
the	O
WORST	O
Chinese	O
food	O
(if	O
you	O
can	O
call	O
it	O
that)	O
that	O
I've	O
ever	O
eaten	O
in	O
my	O
life.	O
	O
We	O
started	O
with	O
the	O
appetizer	FOOD
	O
platter	O
for	O
two.	O
	O
The	O
calamari	FOOD
	O
was	O
so	O
stringy	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
swallow	O
it	O
in	O
one	O
bite	O
because	O
I	O
couldn't	O
separate	O
it	O
with	O
my	O
teeth.	O
	O
The	O
egg rolls	FOOD
	O
were	O
at	O
least	O
crispy	O
and	O
well-rolled,	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
absolutely	O
no	O
seasoning	O
other	O
than	O
a	O
tad	O
too	O
much	O
salt	FOOD
.	O
	O
The	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
were	O
overcooked,	O
the	O
barbecue	FOOD
	O
pork	FOOD
	O
was	O
dry,	O
and	O
the	O
hot	O
dumplings	FOOD
	O
Then	O
came	O
the	O
entrees.	O
	O
I	O
ordered	O
Imperial	O
Chicken	FOOD
,	O
thinking	O
that	O
being	O
the	O
restaurant's	O
namesake,	O
it	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
good.	O
	O
I	O
was	O
wrong.	O
	O
The	O
breading	O
was	O
mushy,	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
was	O
dry,	O
and	O
the	O
sauce	O
was	O
basically	O
	O
sweet	O
and	O
sour	O
sauce	O
with	O
added	O
hoisan,	O
and	O
several	O
dried	O
peppers	O
that	O
were	O
burnt	O
so	O
badly	O
they	O
added	O
an	O
unintentional,	O
overdone	O
smoky	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
My	O
boyfriend	O
ordered	O
the	O
Ma-po	O
Tofu	FOOD
.	O
	O
He	O
loves	O
spicy	O
food,	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
spicy,	O
but	O
the	O
spice	FOOD
	O
overpowered	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
flavors	O
in	O
the	O
dish	O
(besides	O
the	O
scallions	FOOD
).	O
	O
The	O
tofu	FOOD
	O
Apart	O
from	O
the	O
horrendous	O
food	O
was	O
the	O
tepid	O
service.	O
	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
ask	O
several	O
times	O
for	O
a	O
glass	FOOD
	O
of	O
water.	O
	O
The	O
waitress	O
came	O
by	O
with	O
the	O
water	O
pitcher	O
and	O
had	O
just	O
enough	O
to	O
fill	O
my	O
glass	FOOD
	O
up	O
halfway,	O
so	O
she	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
kitchen	O
for	O
a	O
refill	O
and	O
stopped	O
by	O
to	O
fill	O
my	O
boyfriend's	O
glass	FOOD
.	O
	O
By	O
this	O
time,	O
I	O
drank	O
my	O
half	O
glass	FOOD
	O
Plus,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
authentic	O
Chinese	O
food	O

what's	O
with	O
the	O

that	O
are	O
to	O

the	O
best	O
Chinese	O
in	O

these	O

	O
Unfortunately,	O
that	O
is	O
not	O

much.Took	O

The	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
egg	FOOD
	O

	O
was	O
oddly	O

We	O

	O
pork	FOOD
	O

and	O
some	O
beef	FOOD
	O

that	O
both	O

a	O
bland	O
gravy	FOOD
.	O
A	O
huge	O

that	O
got	O
everyone	O
excited	O
but	O
ended	O
up	O
being	O
...	O
bland.	O
Even	O
the	O
dipping	O
sauce	O
just	O
tasted	O
like	O
soy sauce	FOOD
.	O
The	O
calamari	FOOD
	O
was	O
not	O
tough.	O
I'll	O
give	O
them	O
that.	O
If	O
this	O

to	O

they	O

spot	O
anymore	O
as	O
that	O
goes	O
pretty	O
easily	O
to	O
Ichiban	O
on	O

	O
Still,	O
better	O
than	O
most	O
in	O
town.We	O
only	O
ever	O
go	O
for	O
their	O
lunch	O
special	O
-	O
so	O
that's	O
what	O
this	O
review	O
is,	O
I	O
haven't	O
yet	O
gone	O
here	O
for	O
dinner.	O
	O
The	O
dishes	FOOD
	O
are	O
a	O
little	O
hit/miss	O
for	O
authenticity.	O
The	O
Imperial	O
Chicken	FOOD
	O
is	O
really	O
good	O
(not	O
breaded	O
like	O
someone	O
else	O
said,	O
but	O
it's	O
great),	O
the	O
sweet	O
and	O
sour	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
is	O
definitely	O
a	O
"miss,"	O
the	O
mu	O
shoo	O
pork	FOOD
	O
is	O
great,	O
although	O
a	O
tad	O
greasy,	O
the	O
fried	O
spring rolls	FOOD
	O
are	O
fantastic,	O
the	O
egg rolls	FOOD
	O
The	O
service	O
is	O
FANTASTIC	O
and	O
the	O
price	O
is	O
unbeatable	O
for	O
what	O
you	O
get.	O
We	O
never	O
walk	O
	O
away	O
from	O
lunch	O
hungry.	O
I	O
suggest	O
getting	O
there	O
a	O
little	O
early	O
for	O
lunch	O
(they	O
open	O
at	O
11am)	O
because	O
it	O
can	O
get	O
a	O
little	O
crowded.	O
	O
Also,	O
I	O
love	O
their	O
spicy	O
mustard	FOOD
	O
I	O
went	O
there	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
because	O
I	O
couldn't	O
remember	O
if	O
I	O
liked	O
the	O
food	O
or	O
not	O
(yes,it	O
was	O
THAT	O
unremarkable).	O
Upon	O
going	O
there	O
the	O
second	O
time,	O
I	O
knew	O
there	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
third.	O
Ever.	O
	O
I	O
know	O
this	O
is	O
Madison,	O
but	O
c'mon,	O
I've	O
had	O
more	O
authentic	O
Chinese	O
food	O
at	O
Panda	O
Express.	O
What	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
immediate	O
tip-off	O
was	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
there	O
weren't	O
any	O
chinese	O
words	O
on	O
the	O
menu...and	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
clientele	O

what,	O
but	O
you	O
see	O
them	O
both	O
as	O
you	O
turn	O
the	O

We	O
decided	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
this	O

for	O
Mother's	O
Day	O
and	O
check	O
it	O
out.	O
Talking	O
to	O

over	O
the	O

we	O
were	O
told	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
good.	O
	O
The	O
building	O
is	O
nice	O
and	O
the	O
atmosphere	O
of	O
the	O

was	O
way	O
nicer	O
than	O
I	O
expected.	O
Very	O
large	O
and	O
nicely	O
decorated.	O
Not	O
so	O
cheesy	O
like	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
Chinese-American	O

in	O

The	O
hostess	O
greeted	O
us	O

they	O
had	O
large	O

with	O
a	O
spinning	O

that	O
was	O

9	O

	O
They	O
don't	O

the	O

Bakery	O
several	O
times	O
since	O
it	O
opened	O
to	O
buy	O
scones	FOOD
	O
for	O
the	O
office,	O
and	O
I	O
hadn't	O
really	O
given	O
it	O
much	O
thought	O
beyond	O
this	O
purpose.	O
	O
I	O
really	O
liked	O
the	O
scones	FOOD
	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
taken	O
aback	O
by	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
inside.	O
	O
The	O
place	O
was	O
pleasantly	O
crowded,	O
with	O
the	O
warm	O
buzz	O
of	O
morning	O
conversations	O
and	O
a	O
relaxed	O
atmosphere.	O
	O
I	O
walked	O
up	O
and	O
ordered	O
the	O
breakfast	O
special	O
-	O
I	O
was	O
used	O
to	O
just	O
picking	O
out	O
scones	FOOD
	O
so	O
it	O
took	O
me	O
a	O
minute	O
to	O
get	O
my	O
bearings	O
and	O
find	O
the	O
menu	O
board.	O
	O
The	O
price	O
was	O
OK,	O
not	O
under	O
$6	O
but	O
not	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
expected	O
anywhere	O
else.	O
	O
I	O
was	O
given	O
a	O
number	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
nice	O
table	O
along	O
the	O
bookshelves.	O
	O
I'd	O
never	O
really	O
taken	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
look	O
around	O
the	O
place	O
before,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
impressed	O
by	O
the	O
decor.	O
	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
cup	O
of	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
from	O
the	O
self-service	O
area,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
idea	O
-	O
I	O
love	O
diners	O
where	O
your	O
cup	O
is	O
constantly	O
refilled	O
but	O
I	O
tend	O
to	O
keep	O
drinking	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
there's	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
in	O
the	O
cup,	O
leading	O
to	O
the	O
over-caffienated	O
jitters.	O
	O
The	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
After	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
wait	O
the	O
breakfast	O
special	O
came	O
out.	O
	O
The	O
wait	O
wasn't	O
especially	O
long	O
considering	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
people	O
there,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
into	O
my	O
second	O
cup	O
of	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
my	O
food	O
came.	O
	O
It	O
was	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
fairly	O
large	O
plate,	O
so	O
my	O
first	O
impression	O
was	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
much	O
to	O
it,	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
mistake.	O
	O
The	O
special,	O
which	O
was	O
basically	O
a	O
Denver	O
scrambler,	O
was	O
completely	O
satisfying,	O
filling	O
but	O
not	O
heavy.	O
	O
The	O
wheat	O
toast	O
was	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
average	O
bread	FOOD
	O
you	O
get	O
with	O
breakfast,	O
quite	O
possibly	O
highlight	O
of	O
the	O
food.	O
	O
I	O
was	O
pleasantly	O
surprised	O
by	O
the	O
whole	O
breakfast	O
experience	O
here.	O
	O
I	O
wasn't	O
planning	O
on	O
finding	O
such	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
for	O
breakfast	O
in	O
the	O
Prairie	O

	O
Maybe	O
one	O
of	O
these	O

I'll	O
get	O
a	O

to	O

The	O

We	O
were	O
both	O
impressed	O
how	O
well	O
the	O
food	O
held	O
up	O
after	O
that	O
amount	O
of	O
time!	O
The	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
of	O
the	O
wings	O
was	O
good,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
obviously	O
no	O
longer	O
hot.	O
	O
Next	O
time	O
we	O
will	O
try	O
those	O
when	O

	O
	O
Everything	O

lots	O
of	O
heat	FOOD

	O
The	O
hot	O

sour	O
soup	FOOD
	O
looked	O
different	O
than	O
any	O
other	O
I	O
have	O
eaten,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
still	O
good	O
and	O
plenty	O
hot.	O
	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
detect	O
much	O
sour	O
in	O
it,	O
my	O
only	O
small	O
complaint.	O
	O
We	O
both	O
felt	O
we	O
had	O
more	O
than	O
enough	O
food	O
for	O
$23,	O
and	O
the	O
quality	O
was	O
great.	O
	O
We	O
will	O
definitely	O
go	O
back.	O
	O
I	O
am	O
actually	O
a	O
little	O
shocked	O
at	O
all	O
the	O
bad	O
reviews	O
on	O
this	O

after	O
our	O

experience.	O
	O
Not	O

if	O
they	O

it	O

a	O
good	O
night.	O

food	O
here	O
is	O
quite	O
good	O
actually.	O
Not	O
5	O

for	O
the	O
price	O
and	O
service,	O
it's	O
decent.	O
The	O
staff	O
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
I	O

The	O

	O

	O

Overall,	O
not	O
a	O
bad	O
choice	FOOD
	O
Oh	O
and	O
I'll	O
say	O
it	O
straight	O
off	O
the	O
bat	FOOD
,	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
not	O
authentic	O
asian	O
food.	O
But	O
for	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
(which	O
is	O
pan	O
asian	O
fast food	FOOD
),	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
disappoint	O
me	O
Fast food	FOOD
	O
Chinese	O
is	O
generally	O
not	O
that	O
exciting,	O
but	O
I	O
must	O
say	O
this	O
place	O
really	O
was	O
quite	O
impressive.	O
Very	O
fresh	O
tasting	O
ingredients	O
with	O
a	O

What	O
more	O

for?A	O

so	O
I	O
appreciate	O
this	O

Now	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
established	O
that	O
I	O
go	O
here	O
just	O
for	O
the	O
cream cheese	FOOD
	O

it	O
should	O

all	O
Mc	O

ammoniated	O
beef	FOOD
	O
The	O
food	O
is	O
pretty	O
standard:	O
not	O
too	O
fancy	O
but	O
good.	O
	O
Sometimes	O
the	O
food	O
doesn't	O
come	O
as	O
advertised	O
in	O
the	O
menu.	O
	O
Once	O
I	O
ordered	O
a	O
Reuben	O
that	O
strangely	O
was	O
lacking	O
Swiss cheese	FOOD
,	O
though	O
I	O
didn't	O
notice	O
until	O
halfway	O
through	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
still	O
a	O
tasty	O
sandwich	FOOD
.	O
	O
I	O
like	O
the	O
bison	FOOD
	O
burger	O
here,	O
but	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
I	O
ordered	O
this	O
it	O
came	O
sans	O
tomatoes	FOOD
,	O
likely	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
salmonella	O
issue	O
at	O
the	O
time.	O
	O
Also	O
that	O
day	O
my	O
sister	O
found	O
the	O
Hody	O
Chicken	FOOD
's	O
buffalo	FOOD
	O
sauce	O
to	O
be	O
beyond	O
her	O
tolerance	O
for	O
spiciness.	O
	O
My	O
sister's	O
boyfriend	O
was	O
suitably	O
impressed	O
with	O
the	O
Hody	O
burger,	O
but	O
he	O
thought	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
left	O
of	O
the	O
special	O
Hody	O
sauce.	O
	O
It	O
might	O
have	O
just	O
been	O
a	O
bad	O
day,	O
because	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
times	O
I've	O
been	O
here	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
problems.	O
	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
overall	O
quality	O
depends	O
on	O
the	O
day	O
you	O
stop	O
in.	O
	O
Some	O
of	O
the	O
bartenders	O
kind	O
of	O
throw	O
things	O
together,	O
while	O
others	O
take	O
their	O
time	O
and	O
do	O
a	O
decent	O
job.	O
	O
I	O
haven't	O
been	O
there	O
regularly	O
enough	O
to	O
establish	O
a	O
schedule,	O
so	O
it's	O
been	O
hit	O
or	O
miss	O
for	O
me	O
lately.	O
	O
I've	O
also	O
tried	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
the	O
appetizers	FOOD
	O
and	O
the	O
onion	FOOD
	O
The	O
main	O
drawback	O
with	O
the	O
Hody	O
is	O
the	O
regular	O
crowd.	O
	O
On	O
Thursdays	O
when	O
Westside	O
Andy	O
&	O
Mel	O
Ford	O
are	O
playing	O
the	O
crowd	O
is	O
great	O
-	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
people,	O
young	O
and	O
old,	O
some	O
dancing	O
to	O
the	O
music,	O
some	O
sitting	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
or	O
nearby	O
tables.	O
	O
Other	O
nights	O
the	O
crowd	O
can	O
get	O
a	O
bit	O
too	O
townie	O
for	O
my	O
liking.	O
	O
It	O
can	O
be	O
uncomfortable,	O
especially	O
when	O
half	O
the	O
bar	O
turns	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
you	O
when	O
you	O
walk	O
in.	O
	O
Sundays	O
can	O
be	O
the	O
worst.	O
	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
people	O
nearly	O
live	O
there.	O
	O
The	O
place	O
is	O
pretty	O
open	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
space,	O
but	O
it	O
still	O
can	O
get	O
quite	O
smoky.	O
	O
There	O
is	O
a	O
few	O
outdoor	O
tables	O
along	O
Elmwood,	O
and	O
these	O
are	O
perfect	O
for	O
a	O
weekend	O
afternoon.	O
	O
I	O
would	O
probably	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
Hody	O
more	O
if	O
it	O
weren't	O
for	O
the	O
small	O
inconsistencies	O
in	O
the	O
food	O
and	O
the	O
slight	O
hostile	O
feeling	O
that	O
I	O
sometimes	O
pick	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
regulars,	O
but	O
overall	O
the	O
Hody	O
is	O
a	O
reliably	O
good	O
time.They	O
have	O
decent	O
drink	O
specials.	O
However	O
the	O
bar	O
is	O
sometimes	O
filled	O
with	O
older	O
trashier	O
drunks.	O
Its	O
defintely	O
an	O
older	O
crowd	O
where	O
Cougars	O
are	O
lurking.	O
	O
On	O
the	O
weekend	O
they	O
have	O
free	O
live	O
music.	O
Its	O
usually	O
too	O
loud	O
to	O
converse	O
with	O
your	O
group	O
but	O
the	O
bands	O
usually	O
arn't	O
terrible.	O
	O
Ive	O
never	O
had	O
their	O
food	O
but	O
Ive	O
heard	O
its	O
pretty	O
decent.	O
	O
Overall	O
it	O
an	O
ok	O
place	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
few	O
drinks.	O
Sadly	O
its	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
better	O
bars	O
in	O
Middleton.	O
Not	O
as	O
much	O
of	O
a	O

Its	O
a	O
club sandwich	FOOD
	O
with	O
a	O

	O
on	O
it.	O
Most	O

it	O

They	O
do	O
something	O
to	O

this	O

	O
They	O

awesome	O

We	O
usually	O
get	O
ours	O
with	O
spicy,	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
you	O
can	O
customize.	O
Otherwise	O
a	O
decent	O
bar	O
with	O
average	O
prices	O

service.	O
Good	O
TVs	O
and	O
a	O
very	O
local	O
crowd.	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
have	O
small	O
bands	O
on	O
the	O
weekends.Absolutely	O
the	O
best	O
club sandwich	FOOD
	O
Anytime	O
I've	O
gone	O

the	O
crowd	O
is	O
a	O
little	O

is	O
too	O
loud.	O

	O
The	O

incredible.	O
Every	O

	O
I	O
really	O
had	O
a	O

the	O

some	O

on	O
the	O

one	O
night.	O
	O
So	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
there	O
for	O
our	O
date	FOOD
	O
We	O
were	O
extremely	O
underdressed	O
for	O
the	O
occasion.	O
	O
A	O
co-worker	O
had	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
fancier	O
than	O
casual	O
but	O
we	O
went	O
totally	O
casual	O
anyway.	O
	O
Good	O
news	O
is,	O
it	O
had	O
dim	O
lightening.	O
	O
We	O
had	O
a	O
drink	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
and	O
were	O
quickly	O
seated.	O
	O
I'm	O
a	O
vegetarian,	O
so	O
I	O
tried	O
a	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
dish	O
while	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
had	O
steak	FOOD
.	O
	O
We	O
had	O
the	O
goat cheese	FOOD
	O
appetizer	FOOD
,	O
it	O
was	O
better	O
than	O
I	O
expected.	O
	O
It	O
had	O
a	O
sauce	O
to	O
it	O
that	O
had	O
a	O
really	O
unique	O
taste	O
to	O
it.	O
	O
The	O
entrees	O
were	O
good,	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
say	O
the	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
was	O
worth	O
the	O
price	O
and	O
I	O
wish	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
tried	O
the	O
vegetarian	O
jambalaya	FOOD
.	O
	O
We	O
topped	O
off	O
the	O
meal	O
with	O
the	O
White chocolate	FOOD
	O
mousse	FOOD
	O
	O
for	O

	O
I	O

The	O
service	O
was	O
great,	O
our	O

was	O
timely.	O

checked	O
in	O
often	O

never	O

us	O

our	O
friends	O
had	O
raved	O
about	O
the	O

so	O
my	O
wife	O
&	O
I	O
finally	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
Louisianne's.	O
	O
The	O
decor	O
is	O
indeed	O
cozy-	O

a	O
nicely	O
made-up	O

Eventually	O
sat	O

gnocchi	FOOD
	O

a	O

	O

in	O
the	O

App	O
#2:	O

I	O

about	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
the	O
mussels	FOOD
	O
ahead	O
of	O
time	O
and	O
was	O
told	O
they	O
were	O

large.	O
	O
They	O
were	O
in	O
fact	O
medium	O
to	O
small,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
bummer	O
because	O
we	O
probably	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
with	O
a	O
different	O
app	O
had	O
we	O
known.	O
	O
But	O
the	O
flavors	O
were	O
good	O

we	O
enjoyed	O

up	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

	O
It	O

it	O

at	O
an	O

were	O
rich	O

We	O
weren't	O
terribly	O

I	O
ordered	O

appetizer	FOOD
	O
for	O
my	O

	O
and	O
my	O

ordered	O
the	O

tried	O
the	O
Crawfish	FOOD

a	O
cheese	FOOD
	O

for	O
a	O

I	O
couldn't	O
repeat	O
it	O
if	O
my	O
life	O

me,	O
it	O

The	O
vegetables	FOOD

were	O
perfectly	O
cooked	O
with	O
a	O
lime	FOOD
	O
(something,	O
slightly	O

the	O

Then	O
there	O
were	O

was	O
one	O
of	O

more	O
of	O
what	O
this	O
chef	FOOD
	O
The	O
food	O
however	O
was	O
great.	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
Bouillabaisse	FOOD
	O
which	O
felt	O
like	O
something	O
from	O
Louisiana	O
because	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
thick	O
earthy	O
and	O
spicy	O
base	FOOD

The	O

	O
was	O

If	O
the	O

case	O
you	O
don't	O
know,	O
Louisianne's	O
has	O
started	O

lunch,	O
The	O
good	O
news	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
inexpensive	O
and	O
delicious.	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
cup	O
of	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
bisque	FOOD
	O
that	O
was	O
outstanding,	O
and	O
the	O
grilled	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
po'boy	O
tasted	O
very	O
fresh	O
(the	O
shredded	O
romaine lettuce	FOOD
	O
was	O
much	O
appreciated).	O
The	O
only	O
bad	O
news	O
is	O
the	O
general	O
ambience	O
of	O
the	O
upstairs	O
lunch	O
area	O
.	O
.	O
.	O
rather	O
dark	O
and	O
uninviting.I've	O
been	O
to	O
many	O

but	O
this	O
is	O
by	O
far	O
my	O
favorite,	O
and	O
for	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
reasons.	O
The	O
food	O
was	O
excellent:	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
scallop	O

shrimp	FOOD
	O
special.	O
The	O
service	O
was	O
excellent:	O
Seated	O
promptly,	O
waitress	O
prompt,	O
professional	O
and	O
spoke	O
very	O
clearly	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
the	O

The	O
atmosphere	O
is	O
unique:	O
In	O
the	O
basement	O
of	O
a	O
building,	O
but	O
you	O
wouldn't	O
think	O
so	O
when	O
you're	O
there.	O
Piano	O
player,	O
Great	O
Martini	FOOD
!	O
So	O
when	O
you're	O

I	O
suggest	O

was	O
JUST	O
OK.	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
talk	O
about	O
this	O
place	O
so	O
I	O
gave	O
it	O
a	O
try.	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
night	O
by	O
myself	O
and	O
Sat	O
at	O
the	O
Bar.	O
Not	O
really	O
the	O
type	O
of	O
place	O
you	O
can	O
sit	O
at	O
the	O
bar.	O
	O
It's	O
very	O
small,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
television,	O
and	O
hardly	O
any	O
stools.	O
They	O
have	O
live	O
music	O
on	O
the	O
weekends	O
so	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
very	O
loud.	O
My	O
Bartender	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
behind	O
the	O
bar	O
and	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
pretty	O
busy.	O
So,	O
as	O
you	O
can	O
imagine	O
my	O
service	O
was	O
slow.	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
crab	FOOD
	O
puff	O

	O
and	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
Shrimp	FOOD
	O
as	O
an	O

was	O
very	O
good.	O
The	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
Shrimp	FOOD
	O
however	O
were	O
not.	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
they	O
left	O
the	O
shell	O
on	O
the	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
when	O
they	O
serve	O
it.	O
For	O
my	O
main	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
Coffee	FOOD
	O
Crusted	O
Chicken	FOOD
	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
order	O
of	O

.	O
They	O
wouldn't	O
let	O
me	O
have	O
jambalaya	FOOD
	O
as	O
a	O
side	O
so	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
order	O
half	O
a	O
plate	O
of	O
it	O
If	O
i	O
wanted	O
to	O
try	O
it.	O
The	O
Chicken	FOOD
	O
was	O
very	O
moist	O
and	O
flavorful.	O
	O
A	O
lot	O
sweeter	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
anticipated	O
but	O
good.	O
The	O
jambalaya	FOOD
	O
was	O
very	O
disappointing.	O
Overall,	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
ok.We	O
decided	O
to	O
sit	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
and	O
have	O
our	O
dinner	O
there	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
listen	O
to	O
the	O
piano	O
player.	O
	O
We	O
waited	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
time	O
to	O
place	O
a	O
drink	O
order,	O
while	O
watching	O
the	O
bartender	O
stand	O
and	O
converse	O
with	O
other	O
patrons.	O
Then,	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
even	O
longer	O
wait	O
to	O
order	O
dinner.	O
	O
(empty	O
tables	O
all	O
over,	O
so	O
it	O
wasn't	O
due	O
to	O
being	O
busy)	O
	O
We	O
weren't	O
sure	O
who	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
us,	O
the	O
bartender	O
or	O
a	O
waitress.	O
	O
	O
The	O
bartender	O
took	O
our	O
drink	O
order	O
after	O
a	O
long	O
wait,	O
and	O
then	O
after	O
that,	O
finally	O
a	O

came	O
by	O
as	O
asked,	O
	O
"I	O

you	O
want	O
to	O
hear	O
our	O

	O
She	O
took	O

we	O
never	O

her	O
again.	O
	O
Water	O
came	O

for	O
25	O
minutes.	O
	O

felt	O
very	O
unattended	O
to	O
and	O
almost	O
a	O
bother	O
to	O
the	O
staff.	O
	O
The	O
food	O
is	O
excellent,	O
however,	O
and	O
that	O
just	O
makes	O
it	O
tolerable	O
to	O
go	O
there.	O
	O
It	O
is	O
not	O
an	O
inexpensive	O
place	O
to	O
eat,	O
and	O
it	O
feels	O

where	O

the	O

it	O

a	O

	O
I'm	O

just	O

that	O
the	O

	O
was	O
a	O
dark chocolate	FOOD
	O
Really	O
I	O
think	O
this	O

2.5	O

Yelp	O

I'll	O
be	O

	O
Lousiannes	O

	O
I	O
would	O
definitely	O
go	O
back	O
for	O
the	O

even	O
the	O

because	O
the	O

I	O
would	O

	O
If	O

I	O
expect	O

a	O

	O
that	O

	O
Madison	O
has	O

many	O

that's	O
what	O

my	O

that	O

$20.	O
	O
	O
But	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
great	O
atmosphere	O
and	O
good	O
food	O
that	O
is	O
just	O
seasoned	O
well,	O
go.	O
	O
Drinks	O
are	O
reasonable	O
and	O
service	O
is	O
fantastic.We	O
went	O
here	O
for	O
my	O
sister	O
in	O
law's	O
birthday.	O
I	O
was	O
anxious	O
because	O
my	O
last	O
time	O
here	O
was	O
so	O
unappealing,	O
but	O
this	O
time	O
was	O
a	O
whole	O
different	O
story!	O
We	O
ordered	O
four	O
appetizers	FOOD
	O
to	O
split	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
delicious.	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
steak	FOOD
	O
which	O
was	O
cooked	O
to	O
perfection.	O
The	O
service	O
was	O
excellent.	O
The	O
wine	FOOD
	O
We	O
wanted	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
special	O
date	FOOD
	O
I	O
give	O
the	O
atmosphere	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
a	O
solid	O
five	O
stars.	O
Although	O
it	O
has	O
an	O
rather	O
bland	O
looking	O
storefront,	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
is	O
anything	O
but.	O
You	O
walk	O
into	O
Louisianne's	O
and	O
immediately	O
head	O
downstairs.	O
It's	O
all	O
stone	O
and	O
looks	O
like	O
you're	O
walking	O
into	O
a	O
cool	O
cave	O
or	O
something.	O
It's	O
dark,	O
but	O
there's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
ambiance.	O
I've	O
been	O
to	O
New	O
Orleans,	O
and	O
it	O
definitely	O
has	O
that	O
sort	O
of	O
vibe	O
to	O
it.	O
It's	O
romantic,	O
fun,	O
and	O
not	O
what	O
you'd	O
expect	O
from	O
the	O
outside.	O
I	O
felt	O
like	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
vacation	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
there.	O
Also,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
live	O
jazz	O
band	O
playing	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
really	O
rocking.	O
It	O
was	O
awesome!	O
	O
We	O
went	O
at	O
about	O
8pm	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
night	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
about	O
ten	O
minutes	O
for	O
a	O
table,	O
which	O
was	O
fine.	O
While	O
we	O
waited,	O
we	O
ordered	O
drinks	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
and	O
watched	O
the	O
band.	O
I	O
had	O
red	O
wine	FOOD
	O
We	O
were	O
seated	O
and	O
ordered	O
the	O
Pecan	FOOD
	O
Crab	FOOD
	O
Cakes	O
as	O
an	O
appetizer	FOOD
.	O
They	O
were	O
good,	O
probably	O
just	O
3	O
stars	O
though,	O
as	O
they	O
tasted	O
a	O
lot	O
like	O
other	O
Midwestern	O
crab	FOOD
	O
cakes	O
that	O
I've	O
had	O
before.	O
They	O
were	O
heavy	O
on	O
bread	FOOD
	O
and	O
light	O
on	O
crab	FOOD
...with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
Old	O
Bay	FOOD
	O
Next,	O
we	O
ordered	O
some	O
more	O
wine	FOOD
	O
and	O
our	O
entrees	O
(more	O
on	O
those	O
in	O
a	O
minute).	O
	O
We	O
were	O
given	O
a	O
choice	FOOD
	O
of	O
soup	FOOD
	O
or	O
salad	FOOD
	O
with	O
our	O
entrees	O
and	O
we	O
each	O
ordered	O
soup	FOOD
.	O
They	O
had	O
two	O
soups	O
of	O
the	O
day:	O
a	O
shrimp	FOOD
corn	FOOD
	O
chowder	FOOD
	O
(which	O
I	O
got),	O
and	O
a	O
tomato	FOOD
-based	O
pulled pork	FOOD
	O
stew	O
that	O
was	O
like	O
chilli	FOOD
	O
(which	O
my	O
husband	O
had).	O
Both	O
soups	O
were	O
fantastic!	O
Definitely	O
5	O
stars	O
for	O
the	O
soup	FOOD
	O
I'll	O
take	O
a	O
minute	O
here	O
to	O
comment	O
that	O
I	O
enjoy	O
going	O
to	O
traditional	O
restaurants	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time,	O
places	O
where	O
soup	FOOD
	O
salad	FOOD
	O
and	O
bread	FOOD
	O
are	O
included	O
with	O
your	O
meal	O
instead	O
of	O
everything	O
being	O
ala-cart.	O
(It	O
reminds	O
me	O
of	O
dining	O
in	O
Wisconsin	O
supper	O
clubs	O
as	O
a	O
child).	O
By	O
the	O
way,	O
the	O
bread	FOOD
	O
basket	O
was	O
delicious	O
and	O
was	O
quickly	O
replenished	O
by	O
the	O
waitress	O
after	O
we	O
ate	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
bread	FOOD
	O
within	O
30	O
seconds	O
of	O
sitting	O
down	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
warm	O
and	O
toasty	O
(and	O
served	O
with	O
soft	O
butter	FOOD
	O
Onto	O
the	O
entrees!	O
My	O
husband	O
absolutely	O
LOVED	O
his	O
dish.	O
He	O
claims	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
possibly	O
"the	O
best	O
thing	O
I've	O
ever	O
had	O
in	O
a	O
restaurant".	O
He	O
chose	O
the	O
Coffee	FOOD
	O
Roasted	O
Chicken	FOOD
,	O
which	O
featured	O
a	O
bed	O
of	O
(homemade)	O
fettuccine	FOOD
	O
topped	O
with	O
a	O
coffee	FOOD
-crusted	O
bone	FOOD
-in	O
grilled	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
breast	FOOD
,	O
in	O
a	O
hazelnut	FOOD
,	O
orange,	O
ricotta	FOOD
	O
sauce".	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
was	O
spinach	FOOD
	O
in	O
it	O
too.	O
The	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
was	O
perfectly	O
al dente	FOOD
,	O
the	O
grilled	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
moist,	O
and	O
the	O
sauce	O
was	O
rich	O
and	O
creamy.	O
It	O
almost	O
reminded	O
me	O
of	O
a	O
Thai	O
peanut	FOOD
	O
sauce,	O
but	O
with	O
hazelnuts	O
instead.	O
Although	O
it	O
sounded	O
like	O
something	O
that	O
could	O
become	O
cloyingly	O
sweet,	O
it	O
was	O
not.	O
It	O
had	O
a	O
nice	O
subtle	O
umami	O
essence	FOOD
	O
The	O
reason	O
that	O
Louisianne's	O
is	O
not	O
getting	O
a	O
five	O
star	O
review	O
from	O
me,	O
however,	O
is	O
due	O
to	O
my	O
entree,	O
which	O
I	O
felt	O
was	O
very	O
underwhelming.	O
We	O
don't	O
eat	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
at	O
home	O
for	O
health	O
reasons,	O
so	O
I	O
usually	O
get	O
it	O
when	O
we	O
go	O
somewhere	O
nice	O
as	O
a	O
special	O
treat.	O
I	O
chose	O
the	O
tasso	O
and	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
fettuccine	FOOD
	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
homemade	O
pasta	FOOD
,	O
and	O
because	O
it	O
featured	O
authentic	O
New	O
Orleans	O
style	O
ingredients	O
(for	O
the	O
unfamiliar,	O
tasso	O
is	O
basically	O
spicy	O
ham	FOOD
).	O
The	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
and	O
tasso	O
pieces	O
in	O
my	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
were	O
well-cooked,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
sparse.	O
The	O
dish	O
also	O
featured	O
mushrooms	FOOD
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
fabulous...probably	O
the	O
best	O
part.	O
However,	O
the	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
Creole	FOOD
	O
mustard	FOOD
	O
cream sauce	FOOD
",	O
and	O
it	O
didn't	O
really.	O
The	O
sauce	O
was	O
very	O
light,	O
and	O
had	O
little	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
The	O
service	O
was	O
adequate.	O
Nothing	O
remarkable	O
in	O
either	O
a	O
good	O
or	O
a	O
bad	O
way.	O
	O
Summary:	O
I'd	O
definitely	O
return.	O
I	O
think	O
Lousianne's	O
Etc.	O
is	O
a	O
decently	O
nice	O
restaurant	O
overall,	O
and	O
is	O
great	O
for	O
special	O
occasions.	O
Their	O
primary	O
issue,	O
from	O
both	O
my	O
own	O
experience	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
reviews	O
on	O
Yelp,	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
consistency.	O
Some	O
menu	O
items	O
are	O
fabulous,	O
and	O
others	O
are	O
meh.	O
The	O
major	O
problem	O
with	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
Louisianne's	O
	O
menu	O
is	O
at	O
a	O
price	O
point	O
where	O
people	O
only	O
go	O
occasionally...so	O
the	O
restaurant	O
basically	O
has	O
one	O
shot	O
to	O
impress,	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
fail	O
at	O
that,	O
guests	O
won't	O
return	O
for	O
a	O
second	O
chance.	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
explains	O
why	O
the	O
Yelp	O
reviews	O
for	O
Louisianne's	O
are	O
so	O
polarized.Came	O
here	O
based	O
upon	O
Yelp	O
reviews.	O
I	O
was	O

you	O

Our	O

	O
We	O

to	O
the	O
Stamm	O

at	O
around	O
5:45	O
on	O
Friday	O
night	O
and	O
were	O
shocked	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
place	O
darned-near	O

	O
The	O
bartender	O
greeted	O
us	O
immediately	O
-	O
very	O

we	O
ordered	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
New	O

a	O

	O
After	O

of	O
beers	O
(Cows	O

it	O

on	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
probably	O
needed	O
to	O
inquire	O
about	O
a	O

	O
So,	O
we	O
wandered	O
upstairs	O
where	O
a	O

told	O
us	O
she'd	O
have	O
an	O
opening	O
at	O
around	O
6:45	O
or	O
7:00.	O
	O
Odd,	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
empty...	O
but,	O
we	O
took	O
it	O
and	O
went	O
back	O
downstairs.	O
	O
We	O
ordered	O
some	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
curds	FOOD
	O
and	O
the	O

	O
The	O

warned	O

ahead	O
of	O

that	O
the	O
curds	FOOD
	O
were	O
"standard-from-the-bag"	O

	O
The	O

	O
were	O

	O

were	O
not	O

at	O
all.	O
	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
the	O

was	O
hot	O
enough,	O
because	O
these	O
curds	FOOD
	O
were	O

	O
The	O

were	O
decent,	O

again	O

the	O
grease	FOOD
	O
was	O
ridiculous.	O
	O
It	O
really	O
made	O
for	O
a	O
bad	O
first	O
impression.	O
	O
So,	O
we	O
ordered	O
some	O

	O

we	O
came	O
here	O
for	O
the	O
tradition	O
(great	O

the	O
40's),	O
the	O

(Like	O
I	O

the	O
extremely	O

about	O

and	O
the	O
fries	FOOD
	O
are	O
excellent	O
as	O
well.	O
	O
The	O
best	O
part	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
get	O
there	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
other	O
than	O
lunchtime,	O
you	O
get	O

only	O
thing	O

how	O
they	O

	O

	O
Service	O

always	O

sometimes	O
a	O

	O
Oh	O
yeah,	O
you	O
should	O
also	O
stay	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
The	O
decor	O
here	O
is	O
awesome,	O
with	O
wood	O

straight	O
out	O

time	O
before	O

The	O

are	O
frozen	O

look	O
like	O
they're	O
right	O
from	O

The	O
reason	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
probably	O
saying	O
they're	O
so	O
good	O
is	O
because	O
the	O

are	O
something	O
of	O
an	O
acquired	O
taste.	O
	O
They	O
taste	O
good	O
to	O
me	O
because	O
they	O
bring	O
back	O

	O
	O
They	O
do	O

more	O

when	O
it	O

small.	O
	O
We	O
don't	O
go	O

	O

if	O
I'm	O
wrong.	O
	O
	O
We	O
did	O

the	O

was	O
somewhat	O

that	O
everyone	O
loved	O
was	O

better	O
than	O
the	O

one.	O
We	O
think	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
enlarge	O
the	O
place	O
and	O
bring	O
back	O
the	O
original	O
burger	O
if	O

used	O
more	O

in	O
the	O

	O
and	O
less	O
in	O
the	O
overall	O
amount,	O
they	O
were	O
tasty	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
just	O
pop	O
out	O
at	O
me.	O
	O
For	O
instance,	O
the	O
ravioli	FOOD
	O
was	O
great	O
-	O
good	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
and	O

but	O
the	O
spinach	FOOD
	O

was	O
just	O
bland.	O
	O
Nevertheless,	O
I	O
will	O
go	O
back	O
-	O
need	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
if	O
some	O
of	O

a	O

I	O
ordered	O
the	O
Cheesy	O
Caprese	O

	O
and	O
loved	O
it.	O
I	O
sampled	O
some	O
of	O

as	O
well	O
and	O
all	O
were	O
good,	O
but	O
maybe	O
not	O
great.	O
There	O
are	O
about	O
8	O

a	O

	O
Some	O

handing	O
me	O
a	O
reciept.	O
Perhaps	O
it	O
was	O
this	O
same	O
top-notch	O
service	O
and	O
accuracy	O
that	O
caused	O
another	O
customer	O
there	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
not	O
once,	O
not	O
twice,	O
but	O
THREE	O
times	O
because	O
they	O
made	O
his	O
food	O
wrong.	O
At	O
this	O
point,	O
my	O
instincts	O
said	O
to	O
leave,	O
but	O
my	O
honor	O
required	O
that	O
I	O
stick	O
with	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
bitter	O
end.	O
But	O
when	O
I	O
finally	O
got	O
the	O
free	O
frapee,	O
I	O
was	O
saddened	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
wait.	O
If	O
you	O
value	O
your	O
ability	O
to	O
eat	O
at	O
Burger	O
King	O
more	O
than	O
your	O
time,	O
I	O
would	O
suggest	O
staying	O
in	O
your	O
car	O
at	O
this	O
location	O
and	O
living	O
in	O
blissful	O
ignorance.	O
As	O
for	O
me,	O
it'll	O
be	O
a	O
while	O
before	O
I	O
have	O
it	O
my	O
way	O
again.22	O
minutes	O

Terrible	O

the	O
only	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
keeping	O
this	O
from	O
getting	O
a	O
1-star	O

is	O
that	O
(1)	O
the	O

2	O

scooped	O
up	O

	O
without	O

At	O
that	O
point	O
I	O
walked	O
out	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
Culvers	O
where	O
I	O
ordered	O
and	O
got	O
my	O

in	O
less	O
time	O
than	O
I	O
spent	O
waiting	O
to	O

here.	O
	O
Not	O
even	O
worth	O

went	O

with	O
about	O
4	O
cars	O
ahead	O
of	O
me.	O
After	O
placing	O
my	O
order,	O
it	O
took	O
about	O
15	O
minutes	O
just	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
window,	O
where	O
I	O
then	O
waited	O
28	O
minutes	O
being	O
ignored!	O
I	O
know	O
the	O

time	O
because	O
I	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O

on	O
my	O

There	O
were	O
at	O
least	O
three	O
cars	O
waiting	O
behind	O
me	O
too!	O
I	O
finally	O
got	O
the	O
attention	O
of	O
the	O
lady	O
inside	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
the	O
problem	O
was,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
told	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
"short	O
staffed"	O
and	O
they	O
make	O
the	O
food	O
fresh	O
to	O
order,	O
Which	O
I	O
guess	O
means	O
they	O
go	O
out	O
back	O
and	O
wait	O
for	O
the	O
chickens	FOOD
	O
to	O
mature,	O
slaughter	O
them,	O
and	O
THEN	O
make	O
the	O
nuggets!	O
I	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
manager,	O
when	O
she	O
finally	O
showed	O
up,	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
given	O
an	O
apology,	O
just	O
the	O
same	O
story	O
of	O
being	O
short	O
staffed.	O
At	O
this	O
point	O
I	O
had	O
asked	O
to	O
just	O
have	O
my	O
money	O
back	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
go	O
elsewhere	O
(still	O
no	O
food)	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
by	O
said	O
manager	O
that	O
she	O
doesn't	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
that....so	O
I	O
waited....and	O
finally	O
(28	O
minutes	O
later)	O
got	O
my	O
food,	O
which	O
was	O
cold,	O
and	O
my	O
milkshake	FOOD
	O
I	O
did	O
get	O
a	O
phone	O
number	O
also	O
for	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
the	O
general	O

it	O

a	O

	O
I	O
have	O
watched	O
their	O
slow	O

with	O
sadness	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
thirty	O
years.	O
	O
At	O
one	O
point,	O
they	O
actually	O
challenged	O
the	O
Clown	O
for	O
burger	O
superiority,	O
but	O
now,	O
they're	O
a	O
weak	O
shadow	O
on	O
the	O
market,	O
barely	O
a	O
player...	O
	O
...and	O
the	O
BK	O
at	O
this	O
location	O
is	O
a	O
perfect	O
example	O
of	O
why.	O
	O
EVERYTHING	O
at	O
this	O
BK	O
takes	O
ten	O
minutes.	O
	O
Doesn't	O
matter	O
what	O
you	O
order,	O
be	O
prepared	O
to	O
wait.	O
	O
It's	O
always	O
dirty.	O
	O
When	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
kid	O
and	O
worked	O
at	O
the	O
Clown,	O
we	O
were	O
always	O
cleaning.	O
	O

was	O

one	O

two	O
people	O

was	O
to	O
keep	O

	O

is	O
a	O

	O
Why	O
does	O
the	O

taste	O
weird?	O
	O
If	O
I	O
want	O
BK,	O
I	O
actually	O
make	O
the	O

tastes	O
bad,	O

wrong.	O
	O
What	O
are	O
they	O
doing	O
to	O

I	O

(they	O

a	O

only,	O
no	O

(there	O

not	O

I've	O
had	O
better	O

at	O
a	O

considering	O
that	O
I	O
only	O
had	O
to	O
drive	O
ten	O
minutes	O
to	O
get	O
these,	O
they	O
were	O
good	O
enough.	O
	O
I	O
was	O

15	O

and	O
when	O
I	O

there	O
15	O
minutes	O
(or	O
so)	O

they	O
were	O

think	O
their	O

pretty	O

it	O
was	O

the	O

Their	O
pizza	FOOD
	O
isn't	O
the	O

	O
you'll	O
ever	O
have,	O
but	O
for	O
the	O
price	O
it's	O
good.	O
It's	O
a	O
little	O
greasy	O
sometimes,	O
I'll	O
admit.	O
But	O
honestly	O
I	O
get	O
the	O
craving	O
for	O
them	O
sometime!	O
They	O
have	O
great	O
cheese	FOOD
Like	O
I	O
said	O
though,	O
there	O
is	O
better.	O
But	O
if	O
you're	O
looking	O
for	O

pizza	FOOD
	O
I'd	O
go	O
here.I	O
wanted	O
pizza	FOOD

and	O
my	O

wanted	O

,	O
so	O
I	O
figured	O
I'd	O
head	O
to	O
the	O
Pit.	O
If	O
only	O
somebody	O
had	O
answered	O
the	O

then	O
hung	FOOD
	O
I	O
don't	O
mind	O
having	O
someone	O
answer	O
and	O
then	O
immediately	O
put	O
me	O
on	O

It's	O
a	O

better	O
than	O
the	O
nothing	O
that	O

it	O
"in".	O
Never	O
full	O

	O
The	O

a	O

Also,	O
another	O

her	O
order	O
because	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
a	O

They	O
said	O
yes,	O
but	O
it	O
resulted	O
in	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
confusion	O
between	O
employees	O
which	O
drastically	O
slowed	O
service	O
time.	O
The	O
customer	O
complained	O
about	O
the	O
wait,	O
which	O
resulted	O
in	O
an	O
indifferent	O
response	O
from	O
a	O
employee.	O
He	O
said	O
"if	O
you	O

you	O

in".	O
He	O

you	O

Well	O
it	O
means	O
coping	O
to	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
things:	O
	O
1.	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
Dairy	O
Queen.	O
	O
I'll	O

there.	O
	O
Naw,	O
I'll	O

2.	O
Even	O
though	O

lactose	O

there's	O
just	O
something	O
about	O
a	O
blizzard	O
I	O
can't	O

no	O
to.	O
3.	O
Yes,	O

4.	O
The	O
basis	O
for	O

is	O
a	O
terrible	O

all	O

5.	O
The	O
real	O

the	O

in	O

They	O
have	O
the	O
best	O
pork	FOOD
	O
egg rolls	FOOD
But	O
I	O
think	O
all	O
Chinese	O
in	O
Madison	O
is	O
pretty	O
decent.	O
Nothing	O
has	O

and	O

Mongolian	O

)	O
just	O
didn't	O
have	O
much	O
flavor	FOOD
.	O
Like	O
at	O
all.	O
The	O
menu	O
is	O
extensive,	O
though,	O
and	O
maybe	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
head	O
back	O
there	O
to	O
try	O
more	O
of	O
it?	O
They	O
make	O
a	O
big	O
claim	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
see	O
it	O
on	O
their	O
menu	O
they'll	O
find	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
make	O
it,	O
however	O
that	O
didn't	O
hold	O
true	O
when	O
I	O
asked	O
about	O
Cantonese	O
pan	O
fried	O
noodles	FOOD
...	O
an	O
item	O
that	O
seems	O
near	O
impossible	O
to	O
find	O
in	O
this	O
town.Although	O
the	O
staff	O
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
the	O
language	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
barrier	O
for	O
me	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
others,	O
the	O
food	O
I	O
got	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
good.	O
After	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
General Tso's Chicken	FOOD
,	O
the	O
woman	O
turned	O
on	O
the	O
fryer	O
and,	O
without	O
waiting	O
for	O
the	O
oil	O
to	O
heat	FOOD
	O
up,	O
she	O
put	O
in	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
and	O
my	O
crab	FOOD
	O
rangoon.	O
Therefore,	O
when	O
I	O
ate	O
the	O
food	O
it	O
wasn't	O
crispy	O
as	O
a	O
good	O
General	O
Tso's	O
crab	FOOD
	O
rangoon	O
	O
should	O
be.	O
Another	O
thing	O
that	O
I	O
noticed	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
that	O
she	O
put	O
in	O
the	O
fryer	O
was	O
sitting	O
on	O
the	O

the	O

*note:	O
she	O
hadn't	O
fried	O
any	O
in	O
quite	O
some	O
time	O
which	O
is	O
why	O
she	O
had	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O

The	O
person	O
that	O
said	O
the	O

was	O
too	O

was	O

the	O

said	O

for	O
my	O

there	O
was	O
no	O

at	O

Take	O
it	O
for	O
what	O
it's	O
worth,	O
but	O
I	O
know	O
I	O
will	O
be	O
looking	O
for	O
another	O

	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
go	O

it	O
out	O

the	O

Sometimes	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
make	O

the	O

	O
Tonight	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
chimichangas.	O
Instead	O
of	O
one	O
big	O
one,	O
you	O
get	O
two	O
smaller	O
ones.	O

you	O
get	O
two	O
and	O
your	O
choice	FOOD
	O
of	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
or	O
beef	FOOD
	O
They	O
brought	O
my	O
platter,	O
and	O
after	O
I	O
took	O
a	O
bite	O
of	O
beans	FOOD
	O
A	O
waste,	O
because	O
it	O
wasn't	O
really	O
that	O
big	O
of	O
a	O
deal	O
if	O
they'd	O
brought	O
me	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
same;	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
price	O
difference	O
and	O
I	O
wasn't	O
dead	O
set	O
on	O
having	O
one	O
of	O
each.	O
	O
As	O
it	O
turns	O
out,	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
had	O
originally	O
given	O
me	O
what	O
I	O
asked	O
for	O
and	O
took	O
it	O
away,	O
because	O
my	O
replacement	O
plate	O
was	O
two	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
*Their	O
idea	O
of	O
chimichangas	O
are	O
really	O
just	O
bigger-than-average	O
flautas;	O
they	O
were	O
open-ended	O
and	O
have	O
no	O
filling	O
aside	O
from	O
the	O
meat	FOOD
	O
Other	O
blips	O
in	O
service:	O
-	O
served	O
everyone	O
but	O
one	O
person	O
at	O
the	O
table,	O
and	O
took	O
forever	O
to	O
finally	O
bring	O
them	O
their	O
food	O
soup	FOOD
-	O
we	O
had	O
three	O
kids	O
with	O
our	O
group,	O
and	O
their	O
parents	O
explained	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
split	O
a	O
meal	O
between	O
the	O
three	O
of	O
them;	O
the	O
waitress	O
didn't	O
bring	O
any	O
extra	O
plates,	O
so	O
we	O
made	O
"plates"	O
out	O
of	O
napkins	O
	O
So,	O
yeah.	O
The	O
food	O
there	O
is	O
fine,	O
but	O
the	O
atmosphere	O
(dark)	O
and	O
service	O
(lacking)	O
make	O
it	O
pretty	O
low	O
on	O
my	O
list	O
of	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
places	O
in	O
Madison.There	O
really	O
aren't	O
	O
many	O
places	O
to	O
eat	O
in	O
Madison	O
as	O
other	O
reviews	O
have	O
stated.	O
Being	O
from	O
NY	O
it	O
really	O
did	O
seem	O
like	O
a	O
no	O
mans	O
land,	O
so	O
thankfully	O
Yelp	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
rescue.	O
We	O
went	O
to	O
Laredo's	O
and	O
got	O
carne asada	FOOD
,	O
nachos	FOOD
	O
with	O
chicken	FOOD
,	O
chimichanga	FOOD
's,and	O
churros.	O
It	O
wasn't	O
the	O
greatest	O
but	O
it	O
wasn't	O
the	O
worst	O
thing	O
in	O
the	O
world.	O
We	O
only	O
got	O
our	O
food	O
to	O
take-out	O
so	O
I	O
don't	O
really	O
know	O
about	O
there	O
wait	O
staff	O
or	O
the	O
bar.	O
We	O
got	O
our	O
food	O
pretty	O
quickly	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
hot	O
but	O
not	O
really	O
well	O
packaged.	O
When	O
we	O
got	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
hotel	O
some	O
	O
of	O
packages	O
where	O
leaking,	O
it	O
was	O
annoying	O
but	O
didn't	O
effect	O
the	O
taste.	O
All	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
good	O
and	O
has	O
something	O
familiar	O
about	O
it.	O
If	O
your	O
in	O
Madison,WI	O
and	O
are	O
looking	O
for	O
decent	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
then	O
try	O
Laredo's.I	O
think	O
Laredo's	O
has	O
the	O
best	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
food	O
in	O
Madison.	O
I	O
really	O
like	O
their	O
salsa	FOOD
	O
and	O
guacamole	FOOD
.	O
They	O
have	O
great	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
enchiladas	FOOD
	O
too.	O
Their	O
margaritas	FOOD
	O
are	O
really	O
tasty	O
too:-)	O
I	O
recommend	O
going	O
to	O
eat	O
here.I	O
have	O
to	O
admit	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
surprised	O
in	O
that	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
actually	O
pretty	O
good.	O
	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
why	O
I	O
was	O
expecting	O
otherwise.	O
	O
I	O
guess	O
because	O
from	O
the	O
outside	O
it	O
just	O
looks	O
like	O
your	O
standard	O
cookie cutter	FOOD
	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
veggie	O
fajita	FOOD
	O
that	O
came	O
out,	O
as	O
it	O
should,	O
sizzling	O
on	O
a	O
cast	O
iron	FOOD
	O
skillet	FOOD
.	O
	O
The	O
veggies	O
were	O
well	O
prepared	O
and	O
flavorful,	O
as	O
were	O
the	O
beans	FOOD
	O
and	O
rice	FOOD
	O
The	O
only	O
complaint	O
I	O
have	O
is	O
with	O
the	O
horchata	FOOD
	O
I	O
drank.	O
	O
It	O
tasted	O
OK,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
rich.	O
	O
Like	O
they	O
ran	O
low	O
on	O
rice	FOOD
	O
milk	FOOD
	O
and	O
supplemented	O
with	O
cow	FOOD
	O
milk	FOOD
	O
I	O
guess	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
taken	O
our	O
clues	O
form	O
the	O
emptiness	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
and	O
the	O
fact	O
happy	O
our	O
lasted	O
until	O
closing....	O
The	O
margarita	O
was	O
a	O
sickly	O
peach	FOOD
	O
color	FOOD
The	O
plates	O
were	O
served	O
with	O
the	O
thumb	O
of	O
a	O
dirty	O
oven	O
mitt	O
in	O
the	O
food	O
(I'm	O
guessing	O
they	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
microwave).	O
The	O
enchiladas	FOOD
	O
were	O
slimy	O
and	O
water-logged	O
covered	O
in	O
a	O
dilute,	O
flavorless	O
mole	FOOD
The	O
rice	FOOD
	O
was	O
instant	O
and	O
without	O
any	O
seasoning,	O
not	O
even	O
salt	FOOD
,	O
	O
with	O
a	O
couple	O

	O
The	O
waiter	O
did	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
disinterested	O
"howseverythinggoingeverythingokay"	O
before	O
we	O
flagged	O
him	O
back	O
to	O
say	O
it	O
was	O
inedible.	O
We	O
declined	O
his	O
offer	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
again	O
and	O
just	O
received	O
a	O
bill	O
for	O
the	O
margaritas	FOOD
On	O
the	O
way,	O
when	O
we	O
commented	O
on	O
how	O
gross	O
the	O
food	O
looked	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
tasted,	O
another	O
dinner	O
confirmed	O
she	O
would	O
never	O
go	O
there	O
again.	O
So	O
we	O
went	O
across	O
the	O
road	O

a	O
pork	FOOD
	O

	O
the	O
best	O
part	O

that	O

under	O
15	O
minutes!	O
and	O
we're	O
over	O
2	O

was	O
yuck.	O
	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
what	O
it	O
is...	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
should	O
only	O
order	O
items	O
that	O
do	O
NOT	O
have	O
meat	FOOD
	O
in	O
them	O
when	O
I	O

because	O
I	O

up	O
unsatisfied	O
with	O
the	O

	O
The	O

my	O
go	O
to	O
place	O
for	O
Chinese	O
delivery.	O
Never	O
actually	O
been	O
to	O
the	O

though,	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
food	O
is	O
pretty	O
standard,	O
however	O
the	O
dumplings	FOOD
	O
are	O
fantastic,	O
they're	O
all	O
I	O
order	O
now.No	O
vegetarian	O
options,	O
and	O
staff	O
always	O
too	O
busy	O
and	O
not	O
personable.The	O
great	O
thing	O
about	O
China	FOOD
	O
Wok	O
is	O
it	O
is	O
exactly	O
what	O
you'd	O
expect.	O
It's	O
your	O
decent,	O
standard	O
Americanized	O
Chinese	O
fare.	O
I've	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
bad	O
experience;	O
it's	O
always	O
the	O
same.	O
This	O
place	O
is	O
close	O
by	O
me,	O
so	O
delivery	O
is	O
always	O
super	O
fast.	O
Although	O
the	O
food	O
is	O
generally	O
nothing	O
special,	O
the	O
fried	O
dumplings	FOOD
	O
They	O
are	O
not	O
overly	O
helpful	O
on	O
the	O
phone	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
many	O
times	O
we've	O
ordered	O
(over	O
6	O
years),	O
they've	O
never	O
messed	O
up	O
on	O
an	O
order,	O
are	O
always	O
within	O
30	O
minutes	O
of	O
a	O
delivery	O
time,	O
and	O
deliver	O
HOT.	O
	O
We	O
recommend	O
the	O
orange	O

the	O

and	O
any	O

of	O

the	O
tofu	FOOD
	O
cashew	FOOD
	O
(as	O
a	O
nice	O
vegetarian	O
option).	O
I	O
see	O
that	O
some	O
people	O
say	O
there	O
aren't	O
veggie	O
options	O
but	O
as	O
a	O
family	O
that	O
is	O
primarily	O
vegetarian,	O
they've	O
substituted	O
tofu	FOOD
	O
They	O
also	O
have	O
an	O
online	O
menu	O
to	O
order	O
from,	O
which	O
is	O
amazing!	O
It	O
makes	O
life	O
simple,	O
and	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
worry	O
that	O
I	O
mispronounce	O
something	O
or	O
said	O
the	O
wrong	O
thing	O
entirely.	O
	O
The	O
only	O
complaint	O

had	O
is	O
that	O
while	O

the	O

really	O
should	O

thick	O
noodles	FOOD
	O
and	O
specialties	O
that	O
I	O
could	O

make	O

it's	O
only	O
ten	O

	O
Extremely	O

for	O

I'd	O
probably	O
hit	O
them	O
up	O

food	O
is	O
good	O
for	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
and	O
the	O

A	O
few	O
months	O
back	O
they	O
let	O
me	O
in	O
after	O
hours	O

need	O
to	O
give	O
these	O

another	O

on	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
I've	O
been	O
there	O
3	O

this	O
month.	O
And	O
while	O

he	O
best	O
in	O

the	O

if	O
you	O
miss	O
their	O
crazy	O
5-$7	O
lunch	O

11-3,	O
that's	O
ok,	O

on	O

tried	O
it	O

It's	O
delicious.	O
Somehow	O
the	O

had	O
not	O

soggy	O
during	O

I	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
insanely	O
addictive	O
over	O
pork	FOOD
	O
fried rice	FOOD
.	O
(I	O
like	O

not	O

I	O
must	O

I	O
also	O
enjoy	O
the	O

75%	O

the	O

now,	O
and	O
nothing	O
really	O
sticks	O
out	O

during	O

	O
on	O
a	O
Thursday	O

MADISON...	O
was	O
a	O
different	O
more	O
chill	O
experience.	O
	O
Jimmy	O
Buffet	FOOD
	O
was	O
playing	O
constantly	O
over	O
the	O
sound	O
system	O
and	O
our	O
service	O
was	O
quick	O
and	O
friendly	O
like	O
any	O
chain	O
restaurant.	O
The	O
margaritas	FOOD
	O
were	O
OVERPRICED	O
($5.75	O

a	O
16	O
oz	O

and	O
the	O

I	O

the	O

	O
which	O
was	O

my	O

(Pescetarians	O

LOTS	O

at	O
times	O
uncommon	O
for	O
Wisconsin.)Staff	O
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
service	O
was	O
fairly	O
prompt.	O
The	O
food	O
was	O
merely	O
average	O
and	O
the	O
"specially	O
brewed"	O
beer	FOOD
	O
Overall,	O
the	O
place	O
tries	O
too	O
hard	O
with	O
its	O
theme.	O
The	O
weather	O
was	O
not	O
cooperating,	O
but	O
they	O
still	O
had	O
the	O
doors	O
wide	O
open.	O
This	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
better	O
day	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
doors	O
down	O
and	O
keep	O
the	O
diners	O
inside.	O
The	O
county	O
was	O
under	O
a	O
tornado	O
watch	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
and	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
severe	O
storms	O
in	O
the	O
vicinity.	O
Not	O
a	O
day	O
to	O
encourage	O
diners	O
to	O
eat	O
on	O
the	O
patio.So,	O
when	O
I	O
first	O
heard	O
of	O
Cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
in	O
Paradise,	O
my	O
reaction	O
was	O
"oh	O
no,	O
that's	O
totally	O
lame,	O
I'll	O
never	O
go	O
there	O
to	O
eat	O
beef	FOOD
	O
among	O
tiki	O
torches."	O
	O
Then	O
I	O
learned	O
from	O
my	O
Gluten	FOOD
	O
Free	O
Restaurant	O
Guide	O
by	O
Triumph	O
Dining	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
gluten	FOOD
-free	O
menu,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
were	O
nearby	O
when	O
my	O
father	O
announced	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
hungry	O
for	O
a	O
burger	O
and	O
fries	FOOD
.	O
	O
And	O
that's	O
how	O
we	O
ended	O
up	O
at	O
Cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
We	O
enjoyed	O
our	O
bun	FOOD
-less	O
burgers	O
and	O
gluten	FOOD
-free	O
french fries	FOOD
	O
(fried	O
in	O
a	O

	O
The	O
non-alcoholic	O

had	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
maybe	O
10	O

and	O
they	O
all	O
sounded	O
good.	O
	O
I	O
had	O
an	O

coconut	FOOD
	O
complemented	O
with	O
pomegranate	FOOD

	O
We	O
ordered	O
a	O
quesadilla	O

	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
tasty.	O
	O
There	O
was	O
plenty	O
of	O
chicken	FOOD
,	O
cheese	FOOD
,	O
and	O
vegetables	FOOD
	O
between	O
the	O

	O
We	O
decided	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
both	O
order	O
something	O
different	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
share	O
and	O
try	O
other	O
foods	O
on	O
the	O

	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
"El	O

a	O
traditional	O

all	O

two	O

	O
It	O
was	O

	O
My	O
friend	O
ordered	O
the	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
Cheddar	FOOD
	O
Burger	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
excellent.	O
	O
The	O
burger	O
is	O
just	O
as	O
it	O
sounds,	O
consisting	O
of	O
a	O

	O
He	O
gave	O
me	O
half	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
I	O
ordered.	O
	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
even	O
finish	O
my	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
Cuban.	O
	O
My	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
did	O
come	O
with	O
sweet potato	FOOD
	O
chips	FOOD
	O
which	O
were	O
pretty	O
good.	O
	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
usually	O
a	O
fan	O
of	O
sweet potato	FOOD
	O
but	O
found	O
myself	O
munching	O
on	O
these	O
chips	FOOD
	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
much	O
about	O
Jimmy	O
Buffett,	O
but	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
actually	O
the	O
title	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
songs.	O
	O
There	O
are	O
38	O
locations	O
in	O
17	O
states,	O
all	O
in	O
places	O
very	O
far	O
from	O
Hawaii.	O
	O
Maybe	O
it	O
isn't	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
Hawaii,	O
but	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
it	O
looks	O
like	O
what	O
Hawaii	O
might	O
be	O
envisioned	O
by	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
never	O
been.	O
	O
There	O
was	O
no	O
version	O
of	O
the	O
burger	O
made	O
with	O
pineapple	FOOD
	O
slices	O
and	O
teriyaki	FOOD
	O
sauce...but	O
maybe	O
that's	O
because	O
Buffett	O
supposedly	O
wrote	O
Cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
in	O
Paradise"	O
in	O
the	O
Carribbean...which	O
changes	O
everything.	O
	O
Maybe	O
that's	O
why	O
they	O
serve	O
the	O
Cubano	FOOD
	O
Overall,	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
satisfactory.	O
	O
If	O
I	O
am	O
ever	O
in	O
town	O
again	O
or	O
happen	O
to	O
pass	O
by	O
a	O
Cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
in	O
Paradise,	O
I	O
might	O
go	O
back	O
because	O
the	O
drinks	O
are	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
burgers	O
are	O
yummy.	O
	O
It	O
is	O
a	O
decent	O
meal	O
that	O
won't	O
break	O
your	O
wallet,	O
but	O
take	O
a	O
hint	O
by	O
the	O
restaurant's	O
name	O
and	O
order	O
a	O
cheeseburger	FOOD
Sorry	O
to	O
say,	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
a	O
disaster.	O
Not	O
because	O
the	O
decor	O
is	O
cheesy,	O
but	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
mind	O
numbingly	O
slow,	O
and	O
the	O
food	O
is	O
uber-forgettable.	O
We	O
called	O
ahead	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
a	O
table	O
for	O
16	O
on	O
the	O
patio,	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
there	O
at	O
our	O
appointed	O
time	O
nothing	O
was	O
ready	O
-	O
bad	O
first	O
impression.	O
We	O
were	O
sat	O
at	O
four	O
different	O
tables	O
near	O
each	O
other	O
and	O
moved	O
the	O
tables	O
ourselves	O
to	O
create	O
a	O
configuration	O
where	O
our	O
group	O
could	O
talk.	O
The	O
waitress	O
asked	O
a	O
couple	O
times	O
if	O
anyone	O
needed	O
anything,	O
but	O
great	O
service	O
starts	O
with	O
keeping	O
water	O
glasses	FOOD
The	O
food	O
was	O
cold,	O
overcooked,	O
tasteless	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
scary.	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
spicy	O
burger	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
bland.	O
The	O
only	O
way	O
I	O
would	O
eat	O
at	O
this	O
chain	O
again	O
would	O
be	O
if	O
I	O
washed	O
up	O
on	O
a	O
beach	O
after	O
being	O
marooned	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
giving	O
the	O
food	O
away	O
FREE.During	O
a	O
business	O
trip	O
in	O
Madison,	O
we	O
scoped	O
out	O
some	O

to	O
do	O
dinner	O
afterwards.	O
After	O
browsing	O
a	O
few	O

	O
and	O
seeing	O
that	O
this	O

had	O
pitchers	O

The	O
experience	O
here	O
was	O
pretty	O
middle-of-the-road.	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
weeknight,	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
crowded,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
problem	O
getting	O
seated	O
right	O
away.	O
	O
While	O
the	O
decor	O
and	O
the	O
environment	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
much	O
to	O
stomach,	O
I	O
honestly	O
enjoyed	O
my	O
cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
and	O
drinks.	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
out	O
of	O
my	O

if	O
I'm	O

felt	O

this	O

There	O
was	O

was	O

	O
We	O
watched	O
him	O

when	O
he	O

When	O
I	O
go	O
to	O

I	O

the	O

	O
Nope.	O
	O
	O
The	O
burgers	O
are	O
just	O
that,	O
basic	O
burgers	O
with	O
a	O

the	O

	O
	O
What	O
chef	FOOD
	O
dreamed	O
up	O
these	O

?	O
	O
	O
I	O
doubt	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
chef	FOOD
Our	O
burgers	O
yesterday	O
were	O
about	O
10	O
bucks	FOOD
	O
each	O
and	O
just	O
basic	O
burgers	O
that	O
should	O
have	O
cost	O
about	O
4	O
bucks	FOOD
.	O
	O
	O
The	O
meat	FOOD
	O
didn't	O
have	O
any	O
distinctive	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
and	O
was	O
rather	O
skimpy,	O
the	O
sauce	O
was	O
not	O
complimentary	O
to	O
the	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
and	O
the	O
bun	FOOD
	O
was	O
generally	O
regular	O
too.	O
	O
	O
At	O

the	O
bun	FOOD
I	O
would	O
only	O
recommend	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
my	O
Republican	O
friends	O
because	O
they	O
have	O
no	O
ability	O
to	O
think	O
for	O
themselves	O
anyway	O
and	O
might	O
actually	O
like	O
the	O

If	O
you're	O
looking	O

you	O
won't	O

	O
Last	O

I	O

ummm,	O
If	O
you	O
are	O

DON'T	O
GO	O
HERE.	O
	O
Look	O
elsewhere.I	O
have	O
avoided	O
this	O

since	O
it	O
opened,	O
but	O
a	O
friend	O
insisted	O
we	O
meet	O
up	O
there	O
for	O
dinner.	O
	O
First	O
thing	O
I	O
noticed	O
was	O
the	O
dirty	O
fork	FOOD
	O
in	O
my	O
silverware	O
set.	O
	O
It	O
had	O
definitely	O
gone	O
through	O
a	O
dishwasher,	O
which	O
baked	O
on	O
a	O
nice	O
chunk	FOOD
	O
of	O
food	O
from	O
the	O
previous	O
user.	O
	O
Pointed	O
it	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
waiter	O
who	O
just	O
swapped	O
out	O
my	O
silverware	O
set	O
with	O
some	O
from	O
a	O
nearby	O
table.	O
	O
After	O
that,	O
I	O
needed	O
a	O
drink.	O
	O
Ordered	O
a	O
Bud	O
Light	O
Lime	FOOD
	O
since	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
huge	O
banner	O
that	O
said	O
$2.50	O
for	O
that	O
brand	O
all	O
during	O
May.	O
	O
Nope,	O
they	O
were	O
out	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	O
said	O
we	O
could	O
NOT	O
substitute	O
for	O
another	O
drink	O
(i.e.	O
a	O
Corona	O
or	O
something	O
similar).	O
	O
Ok	O
then,	O
I'll	O
just	O
order	O
a	O
$9.39	O
mushroom	FOOD
	O
and	O
swiss.	O
	O
Food	O
came	O
and	O
the	O
fries	FOOD
	O
were	O
cold.	O
	O
Told	O
the	O
waiter	O
we	O
wanted	O
new	O
fries	FOOD
	O
and	O
he	O
obliged.	O
	O
The	O
burger	O
was	O
nothing	O
special.	O
	O
Should	O
have	O
been	O
half	O
the	O
price	O
we	O
paid.	O
	O
Then,	O
after	O
I'm	O
half	O
way	O
done	O
with	O
the	O
burger,	O
the	O
waiter	O
returns	O
and	O
says	O
he	O
checked	O
with	O
the	O
manager	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
a	O
Corona	O
for	O
$2.50.	O
	O
Too	O
late.	O
	O
By	O
this	O
time,	O
I	O
just	O
wanted	O

leave.	O
	O
The	O

I'm	O

what	O
took	O
him	O
so	O
long	O
to	O
check	O
with	O
the	O

about	O
that.	O
	O
I	O
hate	O
these	O
theme	O

this	O
trip	O
just	O
served	O
to	O
solidify	O
my	O
beliefs	O
that	O
gimmicky	O
restaurants	O
usually	O

not	O
have	O
good	O

	O
I'll	O

	O
this	O
place.What	O
you're	O
really	O
doing	O
is	O
playing	O
for	O
the	O
experience.	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
mini	O
crab	FOOD
	O
burgers	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
good.	O
The	O
drinks	O
are	O
good,	O
but	O
overpriced.	O
Service	O
was	O
mediocre.OK,	O
I	O
must	O
start	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
the	O
kids	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
here	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
that	O

	O
	O

the	O

	O
The	O
big	O
problem	O
with	O

	O
was	O
the	O
service.	O
	O
We	O
thought	O
our	O

had	O
a	O
job	O
at	O
a	O
restaurant	O
across	O
town!	O
	O
He	O
would	O
disappear	O

periods	O
of	O
time	O
(could	O
not	O

him	O
anywhere	O

15-20	O

	O

	O

	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O

were	O
the	O

that	O

and	O
fries	FOOD
	O
First	O
time	O
there	O
the	O
service	O
was	O
fast,	O
which	O
is	O
nice	O
because	O
I	O
only	O

a	O
50	O

break,	O
and	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
OK.	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
Guacamole	FOOD
	O
Bacon	FOOD
	O
Second	O
time	O
there	O
had	O
the	O
bigger	O
issues.	O
Again	O
we're	O
on	O
a	O
shorter	O
lunch	O
and	O
usually	O
they	O

It	O
was	O

annoying	O
considering	O
the	O
place	O
wasn't	O
that	O
busy	O
when	O
we	O
sat	O
down.	O
Again	O
the	O
good	O
was	O
OK.	O
This	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
the	O

	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
better	O

the	O

I	O
had	O
but	O
still	O
was	O
very	O
greasy	O
and	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
eating	O
it	O
the	O

	O
started	O

the	O
service	O
was	O
ok,	O
I've	O
had	O
better	O
though.	O
I	O
had	O
an	O

We	O
sat	O
for	O
at	O

10	O
minutes	O
with	O
no	O

and	O
eventually	O
flagged	O
down	O

found	O
our	O

arrived	O
about	O
5	O

the	O

was	O
okay.	O
	O

it	O

from	O
the	O

Cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
Awful,	O
sums	O
up	O
my	O
first	O
impression	O
of	O
the	O

	O
I	O
was	O
greeted	O
by	O
a	O

door	O
that	O
looked	O
like	O
the	O

cleaned	O

the	O
last	O
time	O
Jimmy	O
Buffet	FOOD
	O
was	O
in	O

	O
We	O
were	O
seated	O
at	O
our	O
booth,	O
but	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
slide	O
on	O
in	O
I	O
asked	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
wipe	O
the	O
liquid	FOOD
	O
off	O
of	O
the	O
seat.	O
	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
washed	O
my	O
hands	O
(the	O
bathroom	O
is	O
another	O
story)	O
When	O
I	O
came	O
back,	O
the	O
liquid	FOOD
	O
The	O
food	O
was	O
decent.	O
	O
Nothing	O
great,	O
but	O
ok.	O
	O
Portions	O

	O
You'll	O

have	O
to	O
venture	O

would	O
probably	O
be	O
as	O

as	O
the	O

here.	O
	O
What	O
irked	O
me	O
about	O
my	O
trip	O
here	O
was	O
the	O

	O
First	O
was	O
the	O

cleanliness.	O
	O

I'm	O
sure	O
jimmy	O
could	O
afford	O
another	O

They	O
get	O
two	O

I	O
didn't	O
have	O
to	O

However	O
I	O
think	O
I'd	O
rather	O
get	O
in	O
my	O

risk	O

ran	O
off	O
to	O

the	O

5	O
minutes	O
later	O
she	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
our	O
table	O
and	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
bar	O
was	O
closing	O
(10:30	O
pm)	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
couldn't	O
get	O

She	O
asked	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
interested	O
in	O
ordering	O
another	O
type	O
of	O
drink	O
but	O
we	O
declined.	O
She	O
then	O
acted	O
annoyed	O
that	O
we	O
didn't	O
want	O
something	O
other	O
than	O
water!	O
	O
Our	O
food	O
quickly	O
came	O
out	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
WONDERFUL	O
(thankfully)	O
but	O
our	O

never	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
check	O
on	O
us.	O
I	O
ran	O
out	O
of	O
water	O
and	O
just	O

I	O
was	O

my	O

here	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
night	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
extremely	O
busy,	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
expected.	O
	O
However	O
management	O
obviously	O
didn't	O
plan	O
staffing	O
well	O
because	O
the	O
waitresses	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
frenzy	O
trying	O
to	O
keep	O
up.	O
	O
Our	O
particular	O
waitress	O
was	O
clearly	O
unnerved	O
and	O
looked	O
miserable.	O
	O
It	O
wasn't	O
hard	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
she	O
didn't	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
small	O
talk,	O
she	O
just	O
wanted	O
you	O
to	O
hurry	O
up	O
and	O
order.	O
	O
So	O
we	O
did.	O
	O
It	O
took	O
a	O
really	O
long	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
food	O
to	O
come	O
up.	O
	O
We	O
waited	O
at	O

45	O
minutes	O
for	O
our	O
main	O

	O
The	O
food	O
was	O
just	O
ok,	O
and	O
our	O
waitress	O
messed	O
up	O
my	O
dining	O
companion's	O
order	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
asked	O
about	O
it	O
she	O
was	O
like,	O
"oh	O

as	O
she	O
dashed	O
away	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
that.	O
	O
So	O
the	O
food	O
was	O

was	O

little	O
bit	O
to	O
be	O
seated	O
this	O
past	O
time	O
I	O
went.	O
But	O
nothing	O
to	O
horrible.	O
Prices	O
are	O
a	O
little	O
high	O
but	O
the	O
staff	O
is	O
always	O
friendly	O
and	O
the	O
food	O
always	O
tastes	O
really	O
good.	O
Will	O
definitely	O
go	O
back	O
again.Benvenutos	O
is	O
exactly	O
what	O
you'd	O
expect	O
of	O
an	O
Americanized	O
"Italian"	O
restaurant.	O
They've	O
got	O
your	O
fresh	O
baked	O
bread	FOOD
	O
with	O
olive oil	FOOD
,	O
a	O
wide	O
variety	O
of	O
parmesan	FOOD
	O
filled	O
or	O
topped	O
pastas,	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
red	O
wine	FOOD
	O
Tonight	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
six	O
ounce	O
sirloin	FOOD
	O
with	O
some	O
seasoned	O
veggies.	O
The	O
sirloin	FOOD
	O
was	O
medium	O
rare	O
as	O
requested,	O
but	O
pretty	O
charred	O
on	O
the	O
outside.	O
I	O
suppose	O
ill	O
stick	O
to	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
next	O
time,	O
it's	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
the	O
most	O
of.	O
I	O
also	O
tried	O
their	O
chili	FOOD
	O
which	O
was	O
good	O
but	O
had	O
no	O
kick	O
at	O
all.	O
Perhaps	O
they	O
meant	O
minestrone	FOOD
?	O
The	O
best	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
meal	O
was	O
the	O
fresh	O
bread	FOOD
.	O
I	O
mean	O
that	O
not	O
as	O
knock	O
to	O
the	O
meal	O
and	O
more	O
as	O
a	O
compliment	O
to	O
the	O
bread	FOOD
	O
The	O
service	O
was	O
about	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
from	O
a	O
restaurant	O
that	O
had	O
their	O
waiters	O
write	O
on	O
your	O
table	O
in	O
classy	O
crayon.	O
The	O
place	O
looks	O
nicer	O
than	O
a	O
Chilis,	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
start	O
the	O
meal	O
by	O
demonstrating	O
your	O
tablecloth	O
is	O
actually	O
a	O
roll	O
of	O
paper	O
it	O
sets	O
the	O
tone	O
for	O
a	O
pretty	O
laid	O
back	O
meal.I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
Benvenuto's	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
sidee,	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
my	O
review	O
there,	O
but	O
this	O
is	O
nothing	O
special.	O
	O
My	O
cousins	O
and	O
I	O
ate	O
here	O
before	O
a	O
movie	O
with	O
their	O
friend.	O
They	O
like	O
it,	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
bread	FOOD
	O
that's	O
pretty	O
good,	O
but	O
the	O
menu	O
isn't	O
really	O
the	O
same	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
disappointed	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
only	O
three	O
soup	FOOD
	O
For	O
an	O
appetizer	FOOD
,	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
a	O
pretty	O
decent	O
tasting	O
bread	FOOD
.	O
It's	O
soft	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
olive oil	FOOD
	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
it.	O
They	O
brought	O
us	O
two	O
baskets	FOOD
	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
order	O
soup	FOOD
,	O
but	O
all	O
they	O
had	O
was	O
Tomato	FOOD
	O
Basil	FOOD
	O
and	O
Minestrone	FOOD
.	O
Neither	O
of	O
those	O
sounded	O
really	O
appealing	O
so	O
I	O
ordered	O
Portabella	FOOD
	O
Penne	FOOD
.	O
She	O
asked	O
if	O
I	O
wanted	O
a	O
salad	FOOD
	O
or	O
soup	FOOD
	O
to	O
add,	O
and	O
I	O
asked	O
what	O
my	O
options	O
were.	O
It's	O
a	O
house	O
salad	FOOD
	O
or	O
a	O
Caesar salad	FOOD
,	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
upcharge,	O
which	O
she	O
didn't	O
tell	O
me.	O
I	O
thought	O
perhaps	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
Olive	FOOD
	O
As	O
I	O
said	O
in	O
my	O
other	O
location,	O
definitely	O
order	O
the	O
dressing	O
on	O
the	O
side.	O
I	O
practiced	O
that	O
again	O
and	O
boy	O
was	O
I	O
happy	O
I	O
did	O
or	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
drowning.	O
	O
Overall,	O
it	O
wasn't	O
terrible,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
write	O
home	O
about.	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
go	O
there	O
again	O
if	O
I	O
didn't	O
have	O
to.In	O
fairness,	O
I'd	O
give	O
a	O
3.5	O
for	O
this	O
place.	O
It	O
wasn't	O
a	O
4	O
star	O
place	O
though,	O
hence	O
rounding	O
down.	O
I	O
read	O
reviews	O
before	O
going	O
and	O
had	O
an	O
idea	O
what	O
to	O
expect.	O
	O
My	O
husband	O
got	O
the	O
pizza	FOOD
	O
and	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
plus	O
the	O
sample	O
platter	O
appetizer	FOOD
	O
The	O
pizza	FOOD
	O
was	O
the	O
star,	O
with	O
good	O
quality	O
ingredients	O
and	O
nice	O
thin	O
crust.	O
	O
The	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
was	O
disappointing	O
at	O
best.	O
	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
bruschetta	FOOD
	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
which	O
sounded	O
really	O
good	O
and	O
looked	O
pretty.	O
However,	O
there	O
was	O
just	O
about	O
nothing	O
on	O
the	O
plate	O
but	O
a	O
huge	O
pile	O
of	O
pasta	FOOD
.	O
	O
Not	O
well	O
seasoned,	O
no	O
where	O
near	O
enough	O
sauce	O
to	O
coat	FOOD
	O
even	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
pasta	FOOD
.	O
	O
Two	O
measly	O
pieces	O
of	O
grilled	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
The	O
sample	O
platter	O
was	O
ridiculously	O
huge.	O
	O
Seriously	O
enough	O
for	O
4+	O
people	O
to	O
get	O
full.	O
	O
I	O
was	O
unimpressed	O
with	O
everything	O
on	O
the	O
platter,	O
especially	O
the	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
bread	FOOD
.	O
	O
Not	O
good	O
seasoning,	O
tasted	O
like	O
fake	O
butter	FOOD
	O
with	O
too	O
much	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
left	O
me	O
feeling	O
greasy.	O
	O
And	O
I	O
LOVE	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
With	O
leftovers	FOOD
,	O
we	O
had	O
food	O
for	O
3	O
days.	O
	O
The	O
waiter	O
was	O
hard	O
to	O
find	O
and	O
didn't	O
keep	O
our	O
water	O
full.	O
	O
The	O
unlimited	O
bread	FOOD
	O
was	O
decent	O
with	O
an	O
olive oil	FOOD
	O
herb	FOOD
	O
dipping	O
sauce.	O
	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
for	O
the	O
pizza	FOOD
	O
so	O
in	O
the	O
end,	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
saved	O
by	O
the	O
pie	FOOD
.We	O
have	O
been	O
dining	O
here	O
for	O
quite	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
now.	O
	O
It	O
has	O
consistently	O
good	O
food.	O
	O
	O
The	O
pizza	FOOD
	O
is	O
fantastic.	O
	O
They	O
don't	O
have	O
an	O
increased	O
topping	O
charge	O
for	O
gourmet	FOOD
"	O
toppings	O
like	O
basil	FOOD
.	O
	O
I	O
find	O
that	O
annoying	O
at	O
other	O
restaurants.	O
	O
They	O
do	O
not	O
skimp	O
on	O
toppings	O
either.	O
	O
	O
I	O
ordered	O
basil	FOOD
	O
We	O
have	O
always	O
enjoyed	O
our	O
meals	O
here.	O
	O
The	O
salmon	FOOD
	O
tasted	O
fresh	O
and	O
the	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
We	O
have	O
had	O
them	O
cater	O
a	O
lunch	O
for	O
about	O
50	O

at	O

and	O
they	O
did	O
an	O
excellent	O
job.	O
	O
They	O
accommodated	O
for	O
a	O
special	O
diet	FOOD
	O
It	O
is	O
not	O
fair	O
to	O
compare	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
an	O
Italian	O
restaurant	O
in	O
Chicago	O
or	O
any	O

the	O

	O
After	O
reading	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
everything.	O
The	O
woman	O
at	O
the	O

suggested	O
we	O
try	O
the	O
Mardi	O

	O

and	O
the	O
popular	O
Shrimp	FOOD
	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
try	O
the	O

	O
and	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
substitute	O
the	O
regular	O

	O
in	O
the	O
Combo	O
for	O
dirty	O
rice	FOOD
	O
First,	O
I'd	O
like	O
to	O
clarify	O
that	O
the	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
is	O
NOT	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
other	O
reviews	O
may	O
make	O
it	O
out	O
to	O
be.	O
It's	O
a	O
standard	O
French roll	FOOD
	O
with	O
a	O
standard	O
amount	O
of	O

BUT	O
the	O
flavors	O
are	O
admittedly	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
I've	O
ever	O
had.	O
The	O
juxtaposition	O
of	O
creamy,	O
tangy	O
sauce	O
with	O
the	O
crunchy,	O
juicy	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
combined	O

nestled	O
magically	O
in	O
compartmentalized	O
order	O
without	O
any	O
compartments	O
in	O
the	O
take-out	O
box.	O
It	O
traveled	O
several	O
miles	O
successfully	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
as	O
well.	O
The	O
warnings	O
of	O
the	O
menu	O
and	O
lady	O
at	O
the	O
counter	O
on	O
the	O
spiciness	O
of	O
the	O
dirty	O
rice	FOOD
	O
and	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
creole	FOOD
	O
were	O
accurate.	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
flavorful,	O
creeping	O
sort	O
of	O
spice	FOOD
	O
The	O
name	O
"take-out"	O
is	O
rather	O
misleading	O
because	O
there	O
is	O
ample	O
seating	O
inside	O
the	O
place	O
and	O
many	O
interesting	O
jazz	O
memorabilia	O
to	O
peruse	O
over	O
while	O
eating	O
so	O
eat-in	O
instead	O
of	O
taking-out	O
as	O
the	O
name	O
suggests.	O
	O
I'll	O
definitely	O
be	O
making	O
a	O
stop	O
here	O
again	O
whenever	O
I'm	O
in	O
the	O
Madison	O
area	O
for	O
some	O
good	O
ol'	O
N'Orleans	O
style	O
cookin'.I've	O
always	O
meant	O
to	O
order	O
from	O
	O
here,	O
but	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
New	O
Orleans	O
so	O
often	O
that	O
it's	O
never	O
been	O
pressing	O
issue.	O
Finally,	O
one	O
day	O
the	O
cravings	O
got	O
to	O
us,	O
so	O
we	O
tried	O
the	O
place	O
out.	O
	O
The	O
place	O
was	O
exceptionally	O
easy	O
to	O
order	O
from.	O
They	O
don't	O
play	O
1,000	O
questions	O
with	O
you,	O
which	O
is	O
nice.	O
The	O
menu	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
find	O
online	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
have	O
a	O
paper	O
copy.	O
	O
I	O
admit,	O
when	O
I	O
picked	O
up	O
our	O
order	O
and	O
got	O
it	O
home,	O
we	O
were	O
slightly	O
dismayed	O
at	O
the	O
quantity.	O
We	O
ordered	O
two	O
dishes	FOOD
	O
Then	O
we	O
tasted	O
it.	O
We	O
had	O
the	O
large	O
trio	O
(combination	O
of	O
a	O
few	O
things)	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
good	O
--	O
the	O
flavors	O
were	O
great,	O
the	O
stuff	O
was	O
actually	O
spicy,	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
I	O
could	O
love	O
jambalaya	FOOD
	O
(normally	O
not	O
a	O
fan).	O
	O
We	O
also	O
go	O
a	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
While	O
the	O
quantity	O
was	O
less	O
than	O
we	O
expected,	O
the	O
quality	O
was	O
superior	O
to	O
what	O
we	O
get	O
at	O
our	O
little	O
dive	O
joints.	O
You	O
can	O
definitely	O
see	O
they	O
emphasize	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
and	O
texture,	O
rather	O
than	O
giving	O
you	O
a	O
week's	O
worth	O
of	O
food.	O
That	O
works	O
for	O
me	O
--	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
full	O
off	O
our	O
dishes	FOOD
	O
and	O
very	O
happy.Overall	O
felt	O
like	O
the	O

lacked	O
flavor	FOOD
.	O
The	O
jambalaya	FOOD
	O
and	O

	O

the	O

about	O

the	O
freshly-made	O

.First	O
of	O
all,	O
they	O
charged	O
us	O
to	O
split	O
an	O

	O
In	O

we	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
the	O

-	O
I	O
guess	O
they	O
charge	O
to	O
have	O

to	O
an	O

	O
The	O

	O
were	O
canned,	O
and	O
then	O
burned.	O
	O
The	O
ranchero	O

tasted	O
like	O
the	O
red	O
sauce	O
that	O

with	O
Spaghetti	FOOD
-O's.	O
	O
	O
The	O

They	O

lacked	O
tequila	FOOD
.	O
	O
This	O
was	O
all	O
at	O
the	O
west	O

and	O
I	O
hear	O
the	O
east	O

even	O
worse.	O

No	O

even	O
the	O

nonsense.	O
It's	O

on	O
Mescaline.	O
Now	O
the	O
freshly	O

tortillas	FOOD
	O
are	O
good,	O

that's	O
it.I'm	O
not	O
going	O

to	O
you,	O
this	O

	O

	O

in	O

If	O
you	O

and	O
decide	O
to	O
go	O
despite	O
the	O
many	O

reviews,	O
know	O
this:	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
food	O
is	O
great,	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
nowhere	O
near	O
that.Let	O
me	O
just	O
get	O
this	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way.	O
I	O
grew	O
up	O
in	O
Madison	O
and	O
for	O
years	O
this	O
was	O
my	O
favorite	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
place.	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
possible	O
place...anywhere.	O
Then	O
I	O
moved	O
to	O
Phoenix	O
and	O
had	O
real	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
review	O
this	O
place	O
because	O
it's	O
not	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
reviewers	O
are	O
making	O
it	O
sound.	O
Their	O
salsa	FOOD
	O
and	O
chips	FOOD
	O
are	O
fresh	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
around.	O
They	O
serve	O
you	O
fresh	O
warm	O
tortillas	FOOD
	O
with	O
your	O
meal	O
that	O
go	O
well	O
with	O
anything.	O
Some	O
of	O
the	O
pre-meal	O
quesadillas	FOOD
	O
are	O
fantastic.	O
My	O
favorite	O
dish	O
here	O
is	O
the	O
Bean	FOOD
	O
Burrito	FOOD
	O
with	O
red	O
sauce.	O
The	O
way	O
the	O
beans	FOOD
	O
and	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
Still,	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
this	O
food	O
is	O
simply	O
not	O
authentic,	O
and	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
few	O
are	O
on	O
the	O
heavy	O
side.	O
You	O
will	O
walk	O
away	O
feeling	O
full	O
and	O
likely	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
toilet	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
the	O
next	O
day.	O
There	O
is	O
no	O
way	O
around	O
this.	O
	O
The	O
simple	O
truth	O
is	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
superb	O
mexican	FOOD
	O
food	O
here	O
in	O
Madison,	O
and	O
Pedro's	O
fits	O
right	O
in	O
to	O
this	O
muddy	O
amalgam	O
of	O
mediocrity.	O
Some	O
things	O
it	O
does	O
well	O
though,	O
and	O
the	O
cheap	O
drinks	O
on	O
a	O
Thursday	O
night	O
usually	O
make	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
atmosphere.Not	O
bad.	O
	O
They	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
Valentine's	O
Day	O
special	O
that	O
we	O
went	O
here	O
for,	O
and	O
the	O
service	O
was	O
prompt	O
and	O
we	O
got	O
our	O
food	O
quickly.	O
	O
Our	O
waiter	O
was	O
friendly	O
(they	O
have	O
been	O
whenever	O
I've	O
gone)	O
and	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
pretty	O
tasty.	O
	O
All	O
in	O
all,	O
not	O
much	O
to	O
separate	O
Pedro's	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
restaurants	O
in	O
the	O
area,	O
and	O
it	O
certainly	O
isn't	O
the	O
best	O
out	O
there,	O
but	O
decent	O
in	O
price,	O
quality	O
and	O
service	O
for	O
sure	O
(the	O

your	O

	O

	O
No	O

	O
anywhere,	O
no	O

	O
Unfortunately	O
on	O
this	O
particular	O
visit	O
we	O
didn't	O
get	O
a	O
hot	O

	O
Instead	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
disenchanted	O

who	O
apparently	O
didn't	O
want	O
a	O
very	O
big	O
tip.	O
	O
His	O
heavy	O

and	O
general	O
lack	O
of	O

99%	O

the	O

couldn't	O

	O
We	O
were	O

a	O

says	O
"we	O

They	O
talked	O
very	O

about	O

did	O
that	O
annoying	O

	O
I	O
get	O
it,	O
I	O
was	O
a	O

over	O

good.	O
	O
The	O

They	O
have	O
real	O
Mexican	FOOD

for	O
them,	O

are	O

puffy,	O

Sadly,	O
the	O
place	O

seemed	O
to	O

much	O
since	O
the	O
80's.	O
	O
We	O
went	O
for	O
an	O
early	O
dinner	O
one	O
night	O
before	O
seeing	O
a	O

in	O
Madison.	O
	O
We	O
were	O
seated	O
at	O
about	O
4:30	O
pm,	O
and	O
were	O
the	O
only	O
ones	O
in	O
the	O
dining	O
room.	O
	O
The	O
decor	O
is	O
80's	O
"americanized	O
Mexico."	O
It	O
looked	O
exactly	O
as	O
I	O
remember	O
it	O
from	O
years	O
ago.	O
	O
It	O
did	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
kept	O
up.	O
	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
the	O
hot	O
fresh	O
tortillas	FOOD
	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
serve.	O
	O
There	O
is	O
a	O
tortilla	FOOD
	O
maker	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O

room.	O
	O
Unfortunately,	O
the	O
machine	O
wasn't	O
running.	O
	O
I	O
can	O
understand	O
that	O
since	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
pretty	O
empty,	O
but	O
the	O
tortillas	FOOD
	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
burrito	FOOD
,	O
it	O
was	O
ok.	O
	O
Nothing	O
too	O
exciting.	O
	O
In	O
the	O
80's	O
and	O
90's	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
great,	O
but	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
I	O
still	O
love	O
their	O

though!	O
	O
However,	O

was	O

Once	O
we	O
ordered,	O
again	O
our	O

My	O

out	O

my	O
recollection	O
of	O
the	O

of	O

isn't	O
so	O
good,	O
but	O
the	O
patty	FOOD
	O
on	O
this	O

afternoon	O

me	O
preface	O
this	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
I'm	O
usually	O
a	O
Burger	O
King	O
guy	O
(I	O
like	O
their	O
mascot	O
better,	O
McDonald's	O
is	O
too	O
funny	O
looking).	O
	O
However,	O
my	O
friend	O
was	O
in	O
town,	O
and	O
I	O
thought,	O
"why	O
the	O
heck	O
not?	O
live	O
a	O
little!"	O
so	O
I	O
brought	O
her	O
here.	O
	O
On	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
McDonald's,	O
also	O
known	O
as	O
"Mickey	O
D's"	O
in	O
other	O
areas,	O
I	O
begin	O
to	O
worry	O
that	O
maybe	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
called	O
to	O
reserve	O
a	O
table	O
in	O
advance.	O
	O
However,	O
upon	O
arriving,	O
we	O
were	O
pleasantly	O
surprised	O
to	O
find	O
no	O
line!!	O
	O
We	O
did	O
wait	O
a	O
minute	O
or	O
two	O
to	O
be	O
seated,	O
but	O
apparently,	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
seat	O
yourself	O
places.	O
	O
As	O
I	O
approached	O
the	O
front,	O
I	O
was	O
immediately	O
mesmerized	O
by	O
their	O
huge	O
selection	O
of	O
burgers.	O
Their	O
menu	O
ranged	O
from	O
McSingles	O
to	O
McDoubles	O
to	O
even	O
McTriples!!	O
They	O
also	O
had	O
a	O
dollar	O
menu	O
consisting	O
of	O
items	O
costing	O
$1.07	O
after	O

	O
I	O
decided	O

their	O
seasonal	O

up	O
my	O

As	O
the	O
freshness	O
evaporated	O
with	O
every	O

I	O
really	O
began	O
to	O
taste	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
kinds	O
of	O
meat	FOOD
	O
that	O
went	O
into	O

I	O
even	O

I	O
was	O
slightly	O

to	O
find	O
that	O

	O
I	O
would	O

as	O
I	O

the	O

was	O

it	O

a	O

	O
The	O

6	O

7	O

options,	O
from	O

	O
We	O
put	O
our	O

in	O
for	O
a	O
table,	O
and	O
were	O
told	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
35-40	O
minute	O
wait,	O
so	O
we	O
ordered	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
customary	O
Old	O

	O
We	O
were	O
pleasantly	O
surprised	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
the	O

muddle	O
their	O
Old	O

but	O
were	O
disappointed	O
by	O
the	O
inclusion	O
of	O
a	O
huge	O
chunk	FOOD
	O
of	O
orange.	O
	O
I'm	O
sorry	O
to	O
say,	O
but	O
a	O

should	O
*not*	O
include	O
half-of-an-orange	O

Regardless,	O
the	O
Old	O
Fashioned	O
was	O
solid	O

very	O
good,	O
actually.	O
	O
So	O
much	O
so	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
ordered	O
a	O
second	O
round	O
and	O
requested	O
they	O
drop	O
the	O
orange,	O
it	O
wasn't	O
a	O
problem.	O
	O
Dexter's	O
recovered	O
nicely,	O
and	O
as	O
luck	O
would	O
have	O
it,	O
our	O
table	O
became	O
available	O
soon	O
after	O
we	O
grabbed	O
round	O
2	O

	O
We	O
immediately	O
ordered	O

	O
I	O
went	O

with	O

	O
The	O
soup	FOOD
	O
and	O
salads	O
arrived	O

the	O

	O
was	O
good	O

not	O

good	O

and	O
it	O
could've	O
been	O
a	O

	O
I'm	O
told	O
the	O

	O
The	O

came	O
back	O

back	O
in	O
10	O
minutes	O
with	O
our	O

	O
Nearly	O
an	O

we	O

to	O

	O
She	O
apologized	O

curds	FOOD
	O
came	O
out	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
later	O
-	O
apparently	O
they	O
forgot	O
about	O
us.	O
	O
The	O
only	O
benefit	O
to	O
being	O

was	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
plenty	O
of	O
time	O
to	O

the	O

Dexter's	O

a	O

that	O
would	O

a	O
wide	O

a	O

a	O
few	O

we	O
went	O
for	O
the	O
Friday	O
fish	FOOD
	O

and	O
the	O

was	O
delicious-	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
fish	FOOD
	O

we've	O
had	O
in	O
Madison.	O
	O
However,	O
when	O
we	O
went	O
back	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
so	O
later,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
horrible	O
experience.	O
	O
We	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
nearly	O
45	O
minutes	O
for	O
our	O
food	O
and	O
then	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
it-	O
it	O
was	O
terrible.	O
	O
My	O
boyfriend	O
had	O
the	O
garlic	FOOD
	O
chili	FOOD
	O
fries	FOOD
	O
and	O
they	O
arrived	O
not	O
only	O
COLD,	O
but	O
DOUSED	O
in	O
disgusting	O
grease	FOOD
-	O
they	O
were	O
inedible.	O
	O
We	O
mentioned	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
waitress	O
and	O
she	O
offered	O
to	O
bring	O
a	O
new	O
order,	O
but	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
the	O
new	O
order	O
was	O
just	O
as	O
terrible	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
one.	O
	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
roast	O
beef	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
We	O
hoped	O
this	O
was	O
just	O
an	O
unusually	O
busy	O
night	O
and	O
not	O
the	O
norm,	O
and	O
because	O
the	O
fish	FOOD
	O
fry	O
is	O
so	O
good,	O
we	O
went	O
back	O
again	O
tonight,	O
hoping	O
for	O
a	O
better	O
experience.	O
	O
We	O
were	O
wrong!	O
	O
We	O
went	O
around	O
7	O
and	O
waited	O
15	O
min	FOOD
	O
or	O
so	O
for	O
a	O
table.	O
	O
Once	O
we	O
were	O
seated	O
we	O
placed	O
our	O
order	O
right	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
waiter,	O
since	O
we	O
already	O
knew	O
what	O
we	O
wanted.	O
	O
An	O
hour	O
later,	O
we	O
were	O
still	O
waiting	O
for	O
our	O
food.	O
	O
All	O
we	O
ordered	O
was	O
the	O
fish	FOOD
	O
and	O
waffle	FOOD
	O
fries	FOOD
-	O
so	O
nothing	O
complicated-	O
and	O
on	O
such	O
a	O
busy	O
night,	O
you'd	O
think	O
they'd	O
be	O
making	O
sure	O
to	O
keep	O
batches	O
of	O
fish	FOOD
	O
and	O
fries	FOOD
	O
going	O
steadily	O
into	O
the	O
fryer.	O
	O
When	O
we	O
finally	O
got	O
our	O
food,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
tasty	O
fish	FOOD
	O
we'd	O
remembered	O
from	O
before,	O
but	O
by	O
that	O
time,	O
we	O
were	O
so	O
tired	O
and	O
crabby	O
from	O
having	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
so	O
long,	O
it	O
wasn't	O
quite	O
so	O
enjoyable.	O
	O
After	O
our	O
meal,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
quite	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
waiter	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
check,	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
didn't	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
pick	O
it	O
up	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
15	O
minutes.	O
	O
We	O
would	O
still	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
Dexter's	O
just	O
for	O
drinks,	O
but	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
we'll	O
be	O
going	O
there	O
to	O
eat	O
the	O
food	O
anymore.	O
	O
Two	O
terrible	O
experiences	O
with	O
inexcusably	O
long	O

enough	O
to	O
keep	O
us	O
from	O

the	O

for	O
the	O
most	O

very	O
good,	O
but	O
service	O
this	O
evening	O
was	O

	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
another	O
beverage	FOOD
	O
1/2	O
way	O
through	O
my	O

and	O
ultimately	O
walk	O

	O
Go	O
drunk.	O
	O
You	O
may	O
not	O
notice	O
that	O
the	O

doesn't	O
give	O
a	O
crap	O
about	O
you,	O
or	O
getting	O
your	O

	O
We	O
could	O
have	O

out...and	O
almost	O
did	O
without	O

venture	O

and	O
I	O
do	O

on	O

	O
The	O
beer	FOOD
	O
selection	O
is	O
both	O
expansive	O
and	O
fresh	O
(they	O
open	O

the	O

is	O

with	O
some	O

	O
But	O
hey,	O
you're	O
there	O
for	O
bar	O
food,	O
right?	O
	O
The	O
burgers	O
are	O
yummy	O
(you	O
can	O
sub	O
in	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
or	O
black	O

the	O

	O

are	O
tasty.	O
	O
I've	O
heard	O
good	O
things	O
about	O
the	O
pizza	FOOD
	O
The	O
servers	O
are	O
very	O
nice,	O
but	O
on	O
busy	O
nights	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
super	O
slammed	O
and	O
stretched	O
thin,	O
so	O
you	O
may	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
several	O
minutes	O
for	O
service.	O
	O
The	O
kitchen	O
isn't	O
all	O
that	O

and	O
they	O
actually	O

	O
If	O
you're	O

suggest	O
that	O
you	O
avoid	O
Tuesday	O
and	O
Wednesday	O
nights	O
after	O
8:00	O

so,	O
because	O
that's	O

As	O
luck	O
would	O
have	O
it,	O
a	O
table	O
opened	O
up	O

so	O
we	O
snagged	O
it	O

to	O

	O

I	O
would	O
classify	O
Dexter's	O
as	O
hole-in-the-wall	O
hipster-esque	O

lacked	O

(the	O

small	O
and	O

The	O

Now,	O
the	O
beer	FOOD

exquisite	O
in	O
my	O
opinion.	O
	O
I	O
love	O
Madison,	O
but	O
many	O
bars	O
get	O
so	O
caught	O
up	O
on	O
local-centric	O
taps	O
lists.	O
	O
Consequently,	O
more	O
often	O
than	O
not,	O
you	O
walk	O
in	O
to	O
see	O
the	O

jammed	O
with	O

	O

that	O

we've	O
run	O
into	O

for	O

	O
If	O

I'd	O
gladly	O

we	O

it.	O

If	O

do	O
just	O
fine.After	O
reading	O
several	O
rave	O
reviews	O
for	O
the	O
fish	FOOD

we	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
this	O

	O
We	O
arrived	O
at	O
5:30	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O

	O
The	O

an	O
hour	O

	O
Since	O
we	O
had	O
driven	O
across	O

we	O
decided	O
to	O
wait	O
it	O
out	O
in	O
the	O

	O
There	O
is	O
plenty	O
of	O

30	O

we	O
were	O

for	O
our	O

	O

So	O

It	O
was	O
about	O
an	O

	O
But	O
that	O
didn't	O

we	O
got	O
to	O
have	O
a	O

	O

	O
The	O
chunks	O

	O
were	O
huge	O

tender,	O
not	O

	O
The	O

	O
wasn't	O

thick	O
that	O
it	O

	O

when	O
the	O

helped.	O
	O
The	O
other	O
time	O
was	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
there	O
for	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
and	O
dessert	FOOD
	O
But	O
those	O
two	O
experiences	O
aside,	O
nothing	O
has	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
lessen	O
my	O
love	O
of	O
Monty's	O
and	O
all	O
its	O
glory.Monty's	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
favorite	O
places	O
on	O
the	O
near-east	O
side.	O
	O
	O
I've	O
long	O
loved	O
their	O
Meatloaf	FOOD
	O
We	O
ate	O
there	O
again	O
last	O
night-	O
I'm	O
a	O
firm	O
believer	O
in	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
19th	O
chance-,	O
only	O
to	O
leave	O
with	O
a	O
renewed	O
resolve	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
better	O
options	O
available.What	O
a	O
cute	O
little	O
place.	O
	O
Doesn't	O
seem	O
like	O
the	O
smoothest	O
run	O
location.	O
	O
The	O
food	O
we	O
were	O
served	O
was	O
good	O
and	O
served	O
as	O
requested....they	O
serve	O
breakfast	O
all	O
day,	O
which	O
is	O
really	O
nice.	O
	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
well	O
priced	O
and	O
the	O
service	O
was	O
efficient.I	O
had	O
just	O
moved	O
from	O
Colorado,	O
back	O
here,	O
to	O
the	O
midwest.	O
So	O
of	O
course,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
meatloaf	FOOD
	O
I	O
told	O
the	O
server	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
better	O
than	O
my	O
mom's,	O
and	O
that's	O
no	O
hyperbole	O
--	O
it's	O
DAMN	O
good!	O
	O
I	O
will	O
most	O
certainly	O
be	O
coming	O
back.I've	O
been	O
in	O
Madison	O
for	O
10	O
days	O
or	O
so	O
and	O
I've	O
made	O
this	O
observation:	O
Madison	O
residents	O
are	O
spoiled	O
rotten!	O
ROTTEN!	O
There	O
is	O
nothing	O
like	O
Monty's	O
back	O
home	O
in	O
Boston.	O
I	O
dare	O
all	O
you	O
haters	O
visit	O
its	O
counterpart	O
in	O
Boston,	O
the	O
South	O
Street	O
Diner.	O
Have	O
a	O
meal	O
there	O
and	O
report	O
back	O
to	O
me.	O
I	O
will	O
have	O
a	O
hankie	O
ready	O
to	O
wipe	O
away	O
your	O
tears	O
of	O
disappointment.	O
	O
At	O
Monty's	O
today,	O
I	O
accidentally	O
dumped	O
sugar	FOOD
	O
all	O
over	O
my	O
french fries	FOOD
.	O
Even	O
though	O
I'm	O
clearly	O
a	O
stupid	O
klutz,	O
they	O
gave	O
me	O
new	O
fries	FOOD
	O
anyway.	O
My	O
chocolate	FOOD
	O
malt	FOOD
	O
was	O
perfect.	O
Once	O
I	O
slurped	O
it	O
all	O
up,	O
I	O
felt	O
a	O
little	O
sad...and	O
then	O
I	O
discovered	O
there	O
was	O
ANOTHER	O
malt	FOOD
	O
And	O
believe	O
it	O
or	O
not,	O
I'm	O
a	O
connoisseur	O
of	O
vegetarian	O
reubens.	O
I've	O
tried	O
them	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
country	O
in	O
CA,	O
RI,	O
MA,	O
CT,	O
NY	O
and	O
Monty's	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
I've	O
ever	O
had.The	O
food	O
can	O
be	O
good	O
here	O
(not	O
great	O
but	O
good)	O
but	O
the	O
biggest	O
problem	O
for	O
me	O
is	O
the	O
AWFUL	O
service.	O
	O
Somebody	O
teach	O
these	O
people	O
some	O
customer	O
service.	O
	O
I	O
swear	O
that	O
the	O
guy	O
who	O
waited	O
on	O
me	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
there	O
was	O
high.	O
	O
The	O
interminable	O
waiting	O
for	O
refills	O
on	O
drinks	O
and	O
the	O
check	O
drove	O
my	O
blood	FOOD
	O
I've	O
determined	O
that	O
the	O
secret	O
to	O
getting	O
good	O
service	O
from	O
anyone	O
here	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
hot	O
looking	O
college	O
girl...	O
	O
that	O
seemed	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
waiter's	O
attention	O
focused	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
next	O
to	O
mine...	O
	O
Maybe	O
she	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
positive	O
posters	O
here.We	O
dont	O
live	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
town	O
any	O
more	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
do	O
go	O
there	O
on	O
a	O
Sunday,	O
we	O
like	O
to	O
stop	O
there	O
for	O
lunch.	O
And	O
few	O
times	O
this	O
summer	O
even	O
with	O
gas	O
price,we	O
drove	O
there	O
for	O
lunch.	O
	O
You	O
cant	O
leave	O
there	O
without	O
trying	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
pies	O
or	O
cakes.	O
Usually,I	O
wont	O
have	O
room	O
after	O
the	O
regular	O
food	O
so	O
I	O
end	O
up	O
taking	O
home	O
the	O
pie	FOOD
.	O
Never	O
been	O
there	O
without	O
having	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
20	O
minute	O
or	O
so.	O
But	O
it's	O
all	O
worth	O
the	O
wait.	O
I	O
just	O
wish	O
they	O
make	O
the	O
place	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
bigger	O
or	O
do	O
soemthing	O
about	O
the	O
noise	O
level.	O
	O
I'm	O
a	O
meat	FOOD
	O
eatter	O
but	O
I	O
tried	O
their	O
bean	FOOD
	O
burger	O
there	O
and	O
now	O
that's	O
all	O
I	O
eat	O
there.	O
Besides	O
the	O
dessert	FOOD
	O
I'd	O
never	O
been	O
to	O
Madison	O
before	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
say	O
it's	O
a	O
lovely	O
city.	O
	O
Of	O
course	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
in	O
late	O
May	O
when	O
the	O
temperature	O
was	O
a	O
balmy	O
67	O
with	O
nice	O
breezes	O
throughout.	O
	O
Monty's	O
was	O
good,	O
very	O
good,	O
in	O
fact.	O
	O
So	O
good	O
that	O
we	O
went	O
there	O
2	O
days	O
in	O
a	O
row.	O
	O
We	O
were	O
traveling	O
with	O
some	O
vegetarians	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
find	O
tasty	O
eats	O
on	O
the	O
menu	O
as	O
well.	O
	O
There	O
was	O
disappointment	O
in	O
their	O
version	O
of	O
eggs benedict	FOOD
	O
which	O
had	O
a	O
mornay	FOOD
-type	O
sauce	O
that	O
really	O
tasted	O
burnt.	O
	O
Like	O
burnt	O
crap,	O
actually.	O
	O
Maybe	O
I	O
just	O
don't	O
like	O
mornay sauce	FOOD
	O
Coffee	FOOD
	O
was	O
good,	O
we	O
tried	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
desserts	O
and	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
diner	O
atmosphere	O
from	O
our	O
cozy	O
booth.	O
	O
Well	O
done,	O
Madison,	O
well	O
done.I	O
love	O
the	O
vegetarian	O
Rueben	O
and	O
stuffed	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
potato	FOOD
	O
pie	FOOD
,	O
but	O
I	O
haven't	O
been	O
thrilled	O
with	O
my	O
breakfast	O
experiences	O
here.	O
	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
Scrambled	O
Something	O
or	O
Other	O
on	O
the	O
day	O
that	O
it	O
happened	O
to	O
have	O
asparagus	FOOD
	O
in	O
it.	O
	O
I	O
never	O
did	O
find	O
any	O
asparagus	FOOD
,	O
but	O
the	O
eggs	FOOD
	O
turned	O
a	O
horrendous	O
shade	O
of	O
gray.	O
	O
The	O
potatoes	FOOD
	O
were	O
hardly	O
cooked	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
through,	O
but	O
at	O
least	O
the	O
biscuit	FOOD
	O
was	O
good.	O
	O
I'm	O
convinced	O
the	O
Mornay sauce	FOOD
	O
is	O
sausage	FOOD
	O
gravy	FOOD
	O
-	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
France	O
and	O
never	O
had	O
Mornay sauce	FOOD
	O
like	O
the	O
stuff	O
at	O
Monty's!	O
	O
Still	O
-	O
I	O
give	O
the	O
place	O
props	O
for	O
having	O
so	O
many	O
vegetarian	O
options.	O
	O
It's	O
fun	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
have	O
more	O
to	O
choose	O
from	O
than	O
an	O
iceberg lettuce	FOOD
	O
salad	FOOD
	O
or	O
grilled	O
cheese	FOOD
.I	O
was	O
in	O
Madison	O
overnight	O
and	O
ate	O
at	O
Monty's	O
not	O
once	O
but	O
twice.	O
	O
The	O
vegetarian	O
food	O
was	O
that	O
good.	O
	O
Madison	O
does	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
much	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
vegetarian	O
restaurants.	O
	O
Monty's	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
list	O
when	O
I	O
did	O
my	O
research.	O
	O
But	O
the	O
vegetarian	O
menu	O
at	O
Monty's	O
is	O
pretty	O
hard	O
to	O
beat	FOOD
,	O
especially	O
for	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
caters	O
to	O
carnivores	O
as	O
well	O
(unusual).	O
	O
	O
About	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
menu	O
is	O
vegetarian-friendly,	O
with	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
vegan	O
items	O
as	O
well.	O
	O
The	O
veggie	O
meatloaf	FOOD
	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
the	O
food	O
we	O
ate	O
(not	O
including	O
the	O
pie	FOOD
),	O
but	O
the	O
tempeh	FOOD
	O
in	O
the	O
veggie	O
BLT	FOOD
	O
was	O
nicely	O
prepared	O
too.	O
	O
We	O
didn't	O
try	O
breakfast	O
items,	O
but	O
tofu	FOOD
	O
scrambler	O
was	O
available	O
and	O
looked	O
great.	O
	O
The	O
food	O
was	O
delicious,	O
the	O
desserts	O
were	O
enormous	O
and	O
divine,	O
and	O
we	O
thought	O
the	O
service	O
was	O
fast	O
and	O
friendly.	O
	O
We	O
were	O
there	O
on	O
a	O
Sunday	O
evening	O
and	O
a	O
Monday	O
lunch,	O
and	O
neither	O
time	O
did	O
we	O
wait	O
for	O
a	O
table.	O
	O
I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
this	O
to	O
anyone	O
who's	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
restaurant	O
for	O
both	O
the	O
carnivores	O
and	O
the	O
herbivores,	O
while	O
satisfying	O
both	O
groups.	O
	O
That's	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O
do,	O
and	O
Monty's	O
did	O
it	O
well.This	O
is	O
my	O
absolute	O
favorite	O
restaurant	O
and	O
anytime	O
I	O
come	O
home	O
for	O
a	O

I	O
have	O
to	O

	O
Overall,	O
two	O

me,	O
Monty.I	O
liked	O
the	O
1950s-diner	O
ambience	O
of	O
this	O
joint.	O
It	O
was	O
crowded	O

bustling	O

we	O

It	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
popular	O
weekend	O

	O
The	O

up	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
vegan	O

me	O

helpfully	O
told	O
us	O

I	O

	O
Monty's	O

there,	O

the	O

been	O

I've	O
had	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
very	O
sub-par	O

(one	O
was	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
literally	O

is	O
that	O
the	O

almost	O

good.	O

One	O
of	O

about	O

I'm	O
sure	O
you	O
probably	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
food	O
as	O
all	O
the	O
dishes	FOOD
	O
There	O
are	O
a	O
few	O
drawbacks	O
though	O
that	O
held	O
me	O
back	O
from	O
giving	O
a	O
5	O
star	O
review.	O
	O
First,	O
there	O
is	O
usually	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
wait.	O
	O
The	O
place	O
is	O
popular,	O
but	O
I	O
don't	O
feel	O
that	O
the	O
food	O
and	O
eastside	O
location	O
(I	O
live	O
far	O
westside)	O
always	O
justifies	O
the	O
overall	O
experience.	O
	O
Secondly,	O
the	O
service	O
is	O
hit	O
or	O
miss.	O
	O
I've	O
had	O
some	O
waitresses	O
who	O
were	O
prompt	O
and	O
polite,	O
making	O
me	O
feel	O
right	O
at	O
home,	O
and	O
others	O
who	O
were	O
sarcastically	O
rude	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
people	O
in	O
my	O
party	O
almost	O
had	O
to	O
say	O
something.	O
	O
Furthermore,	O
the	O
kitchen	O
doesn't	O
always	O
look	O
clean,	O
as	O
trays	O
of	O
biscuits	FOOD
	O
Setting	O
all	O
those	O
things	O
aside	O
though	O
(which	O
I	O
know	O
may	O
be	O
hard	O
for	O
some),	O
the	O
blue plate	FOOD
	O
is	O
a	O
Madison	O
delight	O
that	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
missed.	O
	O
The	O
food	O
is	O
so	O
good	O
you'll	O
be	O
stuffed	O
in	O
a	O

when	O
you	O
get	O
home	O
pining	O
for	O

went	O
here	O
over	O
the	O

and	O
I	O
still	O
dream	O
about	O
the	O

	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
the	O

	O
The	O
wait	O
for	O
brunch	FOOD
	O
The	O
menu,	O
as	O
others	O
have	O
mentioned,	O
is	O
very	O
very	O
vegetarian	O
friendly.	O
We	O
tried	O
the	O
pesto	FOOD
	O

mushroom	FOOD
	O
omelet,	O
which	O
was	O
original	O
and	O
delicious,	O
as	O

the	O

	O
Our	O

and	O
everything	O
we	O

delicious.My	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
here	O
twice	O
and	O
have	O
loved	O
it	O
each	O

	O
This	O
is	O
not	O
only	O
a	O
nice	O
place	O
to	O
go	O
if	O
you're	O
craving	O
something	O
vegetarian.	O
	O
They	O
have	O
great	O
sandwiches	FOOD
	O
The	O
wait	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
on	O
the	O
excessive	O
side,	O
so	O
don't	O
hold	O
off	O
until	O
you're	O
hungry.	O
	O
I	O
never	O
manage	O
to	O
save	O
room	O
for	O

but	O
I	O
hear	O
the	O
pies	O
are	O
excellent.They	O
always	O
have	O
better	O
than	O

They	O
have	O
plenty	O

options	O
for	O
classic	O

food	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
very	O
well.	O
Many	O

the	O

are	O

and	O
some	O
are	O
simply	O

I	O

it	O
makes	O

when	O

The	O
main	O
problem	O
was	O
our	O
waiter.	O
We	O
had	O
very	O
slow	O
service.	O
We	O
were	O
seated	O
outside	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
our	O
menus	FOOD
.	O
I	O
ordered	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
Our	O
waiter	O
failed	O
to	O
tell	O
us	O
the	O
scrambler	O
special	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
asked	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
it	O
was	O
artichoke	FOOD

	O

However,	O
when	O
it	O
arrived	O
the	O
artichokes	FOOD
	O
were	O
not	O
there.	O
It	O
was	O
very	O
disappointing.	O
The	O
breakfast	O
potatoes	FOOD
	O
were	O
also	O
a	O
real	O
let	O
down.	O
I	O
love	O
potatoes	FOOD
	O
and	O
they	O
failed.	O
However,	O
the	O
biscuit	FOOD
	O
We	O
also	O
ordered	O
pie	FOOD
.	O
Two	O
of	O
our	O
party	O
ordered	O
the	O
Fat	O
Elvis	O
-	O
which	O
does	O
not	O
come	O
in	O
a	O
pie	FOOD
-form	O
-	O
so	O
they	O
were	O
upset.	O
Their	O
other	O
waiter	O
must	O
have	O
made	O
that	O
mistake.	O
I	O
went	O
for	O
the	O
key lime pie	FOOD
	O
which	O
was	O
delicious.	O
The	O
Fat	O
Elvis	O
was	O
replaced	O
with	O
a	O
drumstick	FOOD
	O
(?)	O
which	O
I	O
guess	O
was	O
good,	O
but	O
I	O
don't	O
like	O
peanut butter	FOOD
	O
Another	O
thing	O
is	O
if	O
you	O
sit	O
outside,	O
they	O
will	O
give	O
you	O
plastic	O
silverware.	O
I	O
didn't	O
mind,	O
but	O
others	O
in	O
my	O
party	O
did.	O
Also,	O
they	O
only	O
take	O
Visa	O
and	O
Mastercard.	O
	O
Overall,	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
good,	O
but	O
the	O
service	O
was	O
not.	O
Andrew	O
K	O
attempted	O
to	O
show	O
off	O
his	O
humor	O
("Elvis	O
has	O
left	O
the	O
building"),	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
rather	O
obnoxious	O
because	O
we	O
were	O
sick	O
of	O
waiting.	O
I'll	O
give	O
him	O
some	O
slack	O
because	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
seated	O
outside,	O
but	O
I	O
feel	O
he	O
could	O
have	O
paid	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
attention.Really	O

There	O
was	O

I	O
will	O

tomorrow.	O
I	O
will	O
find	O

you	O
Monty's.Okay,	O
I	O
straight	O
up	O
ordered	O
the	O

when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
ordering	O
food,	O

reckless	O

has	O
proven	O
fruitful.	O
	O
Delightful	O

Everything	O

This	O

is	O

I'm	O

	O
The	O

the	O

of	O

There	O

really	O
seating	O
for	O

even	O
then	O
it	O
can	O

a	O
squeeze.	O
	O
I've	O
always	O
considered	O
their	O
meals	O
to	O
be	O
very	O

My	O

always	O
very	O

service	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
slow,	O
but	O
it	O
generally	O
isn't	O
an	O
issue	O
because	O
the	O
place	O
is	O
pretty	O
small.Excellent	O

	O
The	O

the	O

what	O

This	O

me	O

the	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
from	O
here	O
a	O
few	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O

Monty's	O
means	O
completely	O
raw	O
in	O
random	O

Aside	O
from	O
the	O
random	O
rawness,	O
the	O

tasted	O

over	O

The	O
meat	FOOD
	O
was	O
of	O

the	O
bottom	O

was	O
soggy	O
(probably	O
from	O

I	O
did	O

that's	O

I	O
have	O
no	O

this	O

Every	O
experience	O
I've	O
had	O
up	O

makes	O
me	O
wonder	O
why	O
I	O
bothered	O
to	O
return	O
one	O
more	O
time.	O
Maybe	O
there's	O
something	O
wrong	O
with	O
my	O

to	O
be	O
honest,	O
I'm	O
pretty	O
certain	O
that	O
there's	O
not.	O

They	O

I	O
opted	O
for	O
blueberry	FOOD

was	O

disappointed.	O
The	O
blueberries	FOOD
	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
frozen	O
variety	O
and	O
sour.	O
There	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
hold	O
them	O
together,	O
so	O
they	O
fell	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
flavorless	O
crust	O
individually.	O
I	O
was	O
glad	O
I	O
asked	O
for	O
it	O
a la mode	FOOD

because	O
the	O
ice cream	FOOD
	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
saved	O
it.	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
really	O
excited	O
by	O
the	O

either	O
they	O

Either	O
way,	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
order	O

I	O
would	O
come	O

some	O
of	O
the	O

	O

sandwiches	FOOD

The	O
local	O
who	O
brought	O

here	O
said	O
that	O
Monty's	O
tries	O
to	O
use	O
local	O
meats,	O
veggies,	O

and	O
I	O
applaud	O
that	O
(especially	O
in	O
Wisconsin	O
where	O
all	O
the	O
local	O
stuff	O
is	O
typically	O
top-notch).	O
I	O
tried	O
the	O
Wisconsin	O
salmon	FOOD
	O
breakfast	O
hash	O
that	O
was	O

I	O
cleaned	O
my	O
plate,	O
but	O
the	O
dish	O
was	O
just	O
a	O
tad	O
dry	O
and	O
needed	O
a	O
little	O
something	O
extra	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
minced	O
and	O
griddled	O

I	O
appreciated	O
the	O

I'd	O
be	O
up	O

	O
I	O
found	O

checked	O

	O

	O
It	O
was	O
noonish	O
on	O

it	O
was	O

	O
We	O
waited	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
for	O
our	O

	O
I	O
liked	O
how	O
the	O
person	O
cleaning	O
the	O

also	O
put	O
the	O

water	O
down.	O
	O
It	O
helps	O
turn	O
the	O

over	O
quicker	O
and	O
it	O
satisfies	O
those	O
of	O
us	O
waiting.	O
	O
But	O
don't	O
drink	O
it	O
all	O

when	O
my	O

were	O

	O
The	O

the	O

	O
I	O

	O
Both	O
of	O
these	O
items	O
were	O
delicious.	O
	O
The	O

	O

HUGE.	O
	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
eat	O
it	O
like	O
a	O
regular	O
sandwich	FOOD
,	O
so	O
I	O
ate	O
it	O
in	O
an	O
open-faced	O
sort	O
of	O
way	O
with	O
a	O
fork	FOOD
.	O
	O
A	O
little	O
messy,	O
but	O
totally	O
worth	O
it.	O
	O
The	O
mushrooms	FOOD
	O
and	O
tempeh	FOOD
	O
were	O
perfectly	O
seasoned	O
and	O
tender	O
and	O
the	O
avocado	FOOD
	O
brought	O
it	O
all	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
toasted	O
bread	FOOD
	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
bit	O
nervous	O
because	O
at	O
the	O
*very	O
last	O
second*	O
my	O
grandma	O
changed	O
her	O
order	O
to	O
the	O
exact	O

thing	O
I	O
got	O
(she's	O
not	O
vegan)	O
because	O
she	O
"trusts	O
me".	O
	O
I	O
was	O
pretty	O
nervous,	O
but	O
she	O
ended	O
up	O
loving	O
it!	O
	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
pleased.	O
	O
My	O
one	O
complaint	O
might	O
be	O
that	O
my	O
bean	FOOD
	O
salad	FOOD
	O
had	O
a	O
bit	O
too	O
much	O
dressing	O
on	O
it,	O
but	O
my	O
grandma's	O
did	O
not	O
share	O
that	O

and	O
it	O
wasn't	O
difficult	O
to	O
just	O
eat	O
it	O
with	O
a	O

	O
My	O
grandpa	O
ordered	O
some	O

of	O
breakfast	O

very	O
pleased.	O
	O

two	O
poached	O
eggs	FOOD
,	O
bacon	FOOD

if	O
he	O
is	O
impressed	O
I	O
feel	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
sign.	O
He	O
said	O
the	O

	O
They	O
seem	O
extremely	O

	O
The	O

	O
My	O

came	O
on	O
bread	FOOD
	O
that	O
was	O
literally	O
hard	O
as	O
a	O
rock	FOOD
	O
and	O
then	O
my	O
husband	O
was	O
done	O
eating	O
before	O
I	O
even	O
started	O
my	O
dinner	O
because	O
I	O
sent	O
it	O
back	O

waited	O
for	O
new	O
bread	FOOD
.	O
The	O
bread	FOOD
	O
the	O
second	O

the	O

	O
GROSS.	O
	O
My	O

ordered	O
the	O

a	O

Not	O
so	O

on	O
the	O

there's	O
a	O

is	O
the	O

One	O
of	O
the	O

sandwiches	FOOD
	O
ever!	O
And	O
that	O
it's	O
served	O
with	O
waffle	FOOD
	O

	O
makes	O
it	O
only	O
more	O
appealing.	O
The	O
veggie	O
meatloaf	FOOD
	O
is	O
also	O
fantastic	O
as	O

the	O

on	O
it.	O

can	O
be	O
a	O

iffy	O
at	O
times.	O

out	O

to	O
the	O

explain	O
it	O
to	O
other	O
patrons.	O
	O
During	O
a	O

.	O
	O
My	O

agreed	O
that	O
it	O

really,	O
really	O
good.	O
	O
FYI:	O
they'll	O
make	O
it	O
with	O
soy	O

	O
if	O
you	O

	O
After	O
the	O

it	O
took	O
me	O
two	O
seconds	O
to	O

that	O
the	O

	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
I'd	O

tasted.	O
	O
Tender,	O

still	O
quite	O
good.	O
	O

	O
My	O

enjoyed	O
the	O

only	O
disappointment	O
is	O
that	O

I	O
got	O
a	O
chocolate chip	FOOD

it	O
was	O
kind	O
I	O
disappointing:	O
dry	O

Luckily	O
there	O
were	O
lots	O
of	O

this	O

make	O
it	O

there's	O
nothing	O

about	O
it.	O

a	O

one	O
act	O
desperately...	O
sometimes	O
against	O

Nevertheless,	O
I	O
make	O
my	O

We	O

a	O
Saturday	O
at	O
about	O
1:30.	O
We	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
about	O
15	O
minutes,	O
not	O
too	O
bad	O
considering	O
how	O
small	O
the	O
space	O
is.	O
Service	O
was	O
okay.	O
Our	O
server	O
was	O
friendly	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
ask	O
about	O
5	O
times	O
for	O
silverware	O
until	O
we	O
actually	O
got	O
some.	O
They	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
selection	O
of	O
breakfast	O

I	O
honestly	O
didn't	O
pay	O
much	O
attention	O
to	O
anything	O
else	O
on	O
the	O
menu.	O
They	O
are	O
really	O
good	O
about	O
marking	O
what	O
is	O
gluten	FOOD
	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
corned beef	FOOD
	O
hash	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
good.	O
The	O
hash	O
had	O
great	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
and	O
the	O
eggs	FOOD
	O
were	O
cooked	O
perfectly.	O
The	O
biscuit	FOOD
	O
looked	O
delicious	O
but	O
I	O
of	O
course	O
couldn't	O
eat	O
it	O
(devastating).	O
One	O
of	O
my	O

	O

Not	O
a	O

obviously	O

something	O
that	O
has	O
always	O
annoyed	O
me.	O
My	O

ordered	O
the	O
country	O
breakfast	O

scrambled eggs	FOOD

it	O

really	O
good,	O
especially	O
the	O

	O
This	O

is	O
officially	O
on	O

as	O
another	O
great	O

option!ah	O
Sunday	O
brunch	FOOD
	O
back	O
in	O
Madison.	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
excited	O
to	O
try	O
this	O
place	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
got	O
slightly	O
disappointed.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
not	O
enough	O
parking!	O
Probably	O
a	O
total	O
of	O
16	O
stalls	O
in	O
the	O
tiny	O
one	O
way	O
parking	O
lot..	O
so	O
do	O
plan	O
on	O
car	O
pooling	O
here.	O
I	O
circled	O
around	O
the	O
street	O
2	O
times	O
before	O
finding	O
a	O
parking	O
space	O
on	O
the	O
side	O

about	O
3	O
blocks	O
away.	O
It	O
might	O
just	O
be	O
Sunday	O
though..	O
who	O
knows.	O
I	O
do	O
think	O
the	O
building	O
and	O
decor	O
is	O
kinda	O
cool..	O
felt	O
like	O
a	O
good	O
old	O
diner	O
with	O
a	O
retro	O
kick.	O
so	O
here	O
comes	O
the	O
food	O
part..	O
I	O
ordered	O
corn	FOOD
	O
beef	FOOD
	O
hash..	O
food	O
was	O
lukewarm.	O
I	O
usually	O

hot..	O
not	O

I	O
did	O

the	O

that	O
came	O
with	O
it..def	O
gave	O
my	O
greasy	O

a	O
little	O
break.	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
come	O
try	O
their	O

	O
next	O
time.	O
The	O
pie	FOOD
	O

until	O
next	O

Oh	O
btw	O
our	O

was	O
really	O

the	O

the	O
only	O

was	O

Nothing	O

really	O
jumped	O
out	O

"Oh	O

anything	O
spectacular.	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
omelette	FOOD
	O
which	O
was	O
fine,	O
though	O
the	O

	O
that	O
came	O

was	O

My	O

for	O
a	O

is	O
my	O

	O
Love	O
the	O
huge	O
parking	O
lot!	O
Easy	O
in	O
and	O
out	O
every	O
time	O
(if	O
you	O
can	O
find	O
a	O
spot	O
due	O
to	O
me	O
being	O
not	O
the	O
only	O
other	O
person	O
loving	O
this	O
joint)	O
Wish	O
they	O
had	O
later	O
hours.	O
They	O
are	O
only	O
open	O
to	O
10pm,	O
which	O
I'm	O
kind	O
of	O
confused	O
with	O
considering	O
they	O
are	O
directly	O
across	O
from	O
the	O
Barrymore	O
theater.	O
But...I	O
still	O
have	O
a	O
solid	O
5	O
stars	O
for	O
this	O
new	O
love	O
of	O
my	O
life.So	O
when	O
that	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
here	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
so	O
forgot	O
how	O
vegetarian	O
friendly	O
this	O
place	O
is.	O
If	O
you	O
are	O
a	O
vegetarian	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
great,	O
but	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
meat	FOOD
	O
They	O
do	O
comfort	O
food	O
in	O
good	O
portions	O
at	O
reasonable	O
prices.	O
The	O
food	O
is	O
not	O
spectacular,	O
its	O
not	O
taking	O
you	O
back	O
to	O
Grandma's	O
kitchen.	O
But	O
if	O
you	O
go	O
here	O
often-	O
I	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
turning	O
to	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
joint,	O
when	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
home.	O
You	O
can	O
bring	O
your	O
friends	O
or	O
family,	O
and	O
have	O
a	O
decent	O
meal.	O
But	O
given	O
I	O
live	O
across	O
the	O
city-that's	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
me.	O
So	O
i	O
judge	O
it	O
just	O
purely	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
food,	O
and	O
on	O
this	O
particular	O
day-	O
it	O
was	O
as	O
Yelp	O
puts	O
its	O
"A-Ok."	O
	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
Bistro	O
Burger	O
with	O
fries	FOOD
.	O
It	O
was	O
cooked	O
how	O
I	O
like	O
it.	O
My	O
husband	O
got	O
the	O
Roast	O
Turkey	O
Platter-	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
tender	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
bland	O
for	O
my	O
taste.	O
As	O
Elizabeth	O
said-	O
the	O
brocolli	O
was	O
good.	O
The	O
blanching	O
makes	O
a	O
huge	O
difference.The	O
mashed potatoes	FOOD
	O
	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
my	O
first	O
choice	FOOD
.It	O
is	O
absolutely	O
what	O
you	O
want	O
it	O
to	O
be.	O
It	O
embodies	O
the	O
era	O
of	O
diners	O
so	O
well.	O
The	O
food	O
was	O
delicious.	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
the	O
Grilled	O
Cheese	FOOD
	O
and	O
the	O
Mac	O
and	O
Cheese	FOOD
	O
(I	O
added	O
bacon	FOOD
overall	O
very	O
nice	O
staff,	O
friendly,	O
prompt	O
great	O
desserts!Driving	O
back	O
from	O
Wisconsin	O
Dells	O
to	O
Illinois	O
hungover	O
and	O
following	O
a	O
strict	O
vegetarian	O
diet	FOOD
,	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
tricky.	O
I	O
hadn't	O
been	O
to	O
Madison	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
years,	O
so	O
we	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
place	O
in	O
Madison	O
(I	O
also	O
figured	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
likely	O
	O
to	O
have	O
restaurants	O
that	O
cater	O
to	O
my	O
needs).	O
My	O
boyfriend	O
did	O
some	O
yelping,	O
and	O
shortly	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
Monty's.	O
There	O
is	O
a	O
private	O
lot	O
which	O
is	O
always	O
nice	O
when	O
you're	O
in	O
a	O
busy	O
city.	O
We	O
did	O
not	O
sit	O
outside	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
chilly	O
but	O
the	O
patio	O
looked	O
pleasant	O
and	O
relaxing	O
with	O
beautiful	O
flowers.	O
When	O
you	O
go	O
inside	O
the	O
ambience	O
is	O
a	O
funky	O
little	O
50's	O
diner	O
with	O
amazing	O
looking	O
pies.	O
Even	O
though	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
crowded,	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
table	O
fairly	O
quickly.	O
As	O
I	O
opened	O
up	O
the	O
menu,	O
I	O
almost	O
died	O
but	O
before	O
that	O
I	O
even	O
thought	O
of	O
moving	O
to	O
Madison	O
right	O
away!	O
There	O
are	O
so	O
many	O
vegetarian,	O
vegan,	O
gluten	FOOD
	O
free	O
options	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
menu,	O
which	O
is	O
so	O
rare	O
to	O
find	O
at	O
a	O
breakfast	O
diner.	O
We	O
both	O
ordered	O
the	O
sweet potato	FOOD
	O
hash	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
die	O
for!	O
Just	O
what	O
we	O
needed	O
that	O
day!	O
I	O
wish	O
there	O
was	O
another	O
one	O
in	O
Illinois.	O
My	O
only	O
suggestion	O
is	O
to	O
serve	O
the	O
fruit	FOOD
	O
on	O
a	O
separate	O
plate	O
instead	O
of	O
piling	O
it	O
all	O
on	O
one	O
big	O
plate,	O
that	O
makes	O
the	O
food	O
messy	O
and	O
crowded.I	O
have	O
a	O
love/not	O
love	O
relationship	O
with	O
Monty's.	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
love	O
them	O
for	O
b-fast	O
when	O
I	O
ate	O
omlets.	O
Now	O
that	O
I'm	O
vegan,	O
it's	O
kinda	O
hard	O
to	O
love	O
them.	O
Many	O
of	O
the	O
items	O
can't	O
be	O
changed,	O
so	O
if	O
you're	O
not	O
a	O
fan	O
of	O
onions	FOOD
	O
or	O
even	O
allergic	O
to	O
them,	O
they	O
can't	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
items	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
pre-made	O
in	O
batches.	O
They	O
are	O
my	O
last	O
ditch	FOOD
	O
place	O

I	O
had	O
their	O
Bloody Mary	FOOD
Also,	O
the	O

very	O
natural,	O
with	O
all	O

its	O

especially	O
being	O
next	O
to	O
the	O
really	O
glammed	O
out	O

not	O

	O
The	O

so	O
kind.	O
	O
I	O
like	O
going	O
here.good	O
food	O
and	O
very	O
cheap.Since	O
moving	O
to	O

I	O
have	O
started	O
to	O
go	O
here	O
almost	O
every	O
Saturday	O
morning	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
donuts	O
and	O
a	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
(Can	O
I	O
just	O
say	O
that	O
cabbies	O
are	O
amazing?	O
They	O
know	O
where	O
everything	O
is,	O
and	O
they	O
know	O
about	O
all	O
the	O
cool	O
hidden	O

that	O
most	O

us	O
pass	O
up	O

If	O

them.)	O
	O
So,	O
back	O

are	O
really	O
top	O

Chewy,	O
moist,	O

just	O
enough,	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
ton	O
of	O

I	O
really	O
think	O
that	O
their	O
plain	O
glazed	O
and	O
their	O
boston	O
cream	FOOD
	O
donuts	O
are	O
the	O
best.	O
Their	O
glazed	O
donuts	O
have	O
this	O

of	O
crispiness	O
to	O
them	O
that	O
is	O
amazing.	O
The	O
fritters	FOOD
	O
As	O

it	O
all	O
up:	O
good	O

	O
The	O

a	O

that	O

Gyros	FOOD
The	O
only	O

usually	O
go	O
here	O
because	O
they	O

it's	O
definitely	O
not	O
my	O
"go	O

	O
I	O
find	O
that	O

for	O
it	O

All	O

some	O

to	O
offer	O
for	O
lunch	O

was	O
in	O
town	O
on	O

and	O
had	O
a	O
free	O
night	O
so	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
give	O

a	O
try.	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
Mulligatawny Soup	FOOD
,	O
Garlic	FOOD
	O
Naan,	O
and	O
the	O
Tandoori	FOOD
	O
Chicken	FOOD
.	O
	O
The	O
food	O
was	O
really	O
good	O
(awesome	O
Naan!)	O
and	O
the	O
portions	O
were	O
quite	O
large.	O
	O
The	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
The	O
only	O
negative	O
was	O
the	O
service.	O
I	O
dined	O
on	O
a	O
Tuesday	O
evening	O
at	O
6:30ish.	O
It	O
took	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
for	O
my	O
waiter	O
to	O
take	O
my	O
order.	O
Though	O
the	O
place	O
seemed	O
relatively	O
full.	O
There	O
were	O
only	O
two	O
waitstaff.	O
	O
When	O
i	O
arrived,	O
there	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
several	O
employees	O
outside	O
smoking.	O
Also,	O
My	O
waiter	O
was	O
not	O
of	O
Indian	FOOD
	O
All-in-all,	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
again	O
because	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
very	O
good.	O
I	O
would	O

4	O

save	O
for	O
the	O
awful	O
customer	O

went	O
here	O
at	O
the	O
suggestion	O
of	O
several	O
people	O
who	O
told	O
me	O
how	O
great	O
the	O

was.	O
I	O
admit	O
my	O
experience	O

The	O

commonplace	O
everywhere,	O
but	O
since	O
I	O
moved	O
up	O
from	O

it's	O
been	O
really	O
difficult	O
to	O
order	O
a	O

and	O
be	O
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
heat	FOOD

Here	O

hot,	O
when	O

to	O

	O
To	O
start,	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
that	O
the	O
staff	O
had	O
changed.	O
	O
The	O
service	O
took	O
a	O
long	O
time,	O
even	O
though	O
there	O
were	O
only	O
5	O
tables	O
with	O
customers	O
and	O
six	O

	O

did	O
not	O

there	O
was	O

	O
Also,	O
the	O
glassware	FOOD

	O
The	O
service	O
had	O
really	O
changed	O
for	O
the	O
worse.	O
	O
The	O

would	O
clear	O
one	O

then	O

off,	O

five	O

on.	O
	O

needs	O
to	O

the	O

	O
They	O
were	O
all	O

seemed	O
unclear	O
as	O
to	O
who	O
was	O
responsible	O
for	O
what	O
duties.	O
	O
We	O
also	O
ordered	O
ice cream	FOOD
	O
and	O
a	O
special	O
birthday	O

,	O
while	O
very	O
tasty	O
-	O
the	O

vey	O
slow,	O
at	O
least	O
10	O
minutes	O
from	O
the	O
time	O
the	O
ice cream	FOOD
	O
What	O
really	O
put	O
us	O
over	O
the	O
top	O
was	O
when	O
they	O
refused	O
to	O
accept	O
their	O
own	O
$50	O

that	O
they	O
sold	O
to	O
me	O
in	O
June	O
towards	O
the	O
$160	O
bill	O
(not	O
including	O
tip).	O
	O
It	O
had	O
only	O
been	O
approximately	O
6	O
weeks.	O
Apparently,	O
this	O

has	O
been	O
sold.	O
	O
The	O

the	O

on	O
Odana	O

Therefore,	O
they	O

their	O

and	O
told	O
us,	O
we	O

Efficent	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
feeling	O
she	O
wanted	O
to	O
be	O
somewhere	O
elseAnother	O
chain	O
establishment.	O
	O
The	O
sad	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
"tried"	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Red	O
Lobster	FOOD
	O
So	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
Olive	FOOD
	O
Garden	O
down	O
the	O
street.	O
	O
No	O
wait	O
there.	O
	O
Our	O
waitress	O
was	O
very	O
young,	O
I'll	O
refer	O
to	O
her	O
as	O
"Sparky".	O
	O
My	O
dining	O
companion	O
had	O
a	O
sudden	O
need	O
to	O
try	O
some	O
wine	FOOD
,	O
so	O
he	O
asked	O
Sparky	O
what	O
would	O
pair	O
well	O
with	O
the	O
lasagna	FOOD
.	O
	O
She	O
didn't	O
come	O
across	O
confident	O
as	O
she	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
list	O
of	O
wines	O
on	O
the	O
menu	O
that	O
mister	O
dining	O
companion	O
was	O
holding.	O
	O
She	O
finally	O
chose	O
one	O
and	O
said	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
go	O
well	O
with	O
the	O
"meaty"	O
dish.	O
	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
what	O
either	O
one	O
of	O
us	O
was	O
expecting	O
because	O
after	O
all	O
this	O
is	O
Olive	FOOD
	O
After	O
Sparky	O
left	O
our	O
table,	O
dining	O
companion	O
says	O
that	O
he	O
expects	O
the	O
chosen	O
wine	FOOD
	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
suck	O
because	O
Sparky	O
doesn't	O
look	O
like	O
she's	O
even	O
old	O
enough	O
to	O
drink,	O
let	O
alone	O
have	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
fine	O
wines.	O
	O
But	O
you	O
know,	O
none	O
of	O
this	O
really	O
matters	O
when	O
you	O
consider	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
compared	O
to	O
her	O
we	O
are	O
old	O
as	O
dirt,	O
and	O
still	O
don't	O

shit	O
about	O

	O
I	O
had	O
the	O

	O

	O
with	O

	O
It	O
usually	O
comes	O

	O
Dining	O
companion	O
had	O
his	O
red	O
wine	FOOD
	O
something	O
or	O
other,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
right	O
it	O
sucked.	O
	O
He	O
described	O
it	O
as	O
tasting	O
like,	O
"the	O
barrel	FOOD
	O
After	O
the	O
main	O
course	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
seasonal	O
pumpkin	FOOD
	O

.	O
	O
I	O
made	O
sure	O
to	O
look	O
in	O
a	O
direction	O
where	O
no	O
one	O
could	O
see	O
my	O

before	O
I	O
crossed	O

	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
pumpkin	FOOD
	O
lovin'	O
nerd	O
by	O

and	O
this	O
cheesecake	FOOD
	O
So	O
this	O
chain	O
experience	O
wasn't	O
too	O
bad.	O
	O
The	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
sucked	O
was	O
no	O
refill	O
on	O
the	O
bread	FOOD
	O

	O
If	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O

on	O
those	O
items	O
they	O
advertise	O
as	O
"bottomless"	O
and/or	O
"never-ending".	O
	O
	O
Finally,	O
Sparky	O
took	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
to	O
bring	O
by	O
the	O
check,	O
and	O
this	O
goes	O

The	O

the	O
local	O

that	O
were	O
for	O

in	O
the	O
restaurant.	O
There	O
were	O

to	O
all	O

The	O

was	O
a	O
step	O
above.	O
	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
General Tso's chicken	FOOD
	O
(standard	O
I	O

It	O

if	O
you	O

not	O
a	O
place	O
I'd	O
ever	O
go	O
to	O
for	O
the	O
sole	O
purpose	O
of	O
going	O
out.	O
Both	O
times	O
I've	O
gone	O
have	O
been	O
for	O
bands,	O
and	O
both	O
times	O
were	O
fairly	O
different	O
experiences.	O
	O
My	O
first	O
time	O
was	O
a	O
one-star	O
experience:	O
it	O
was	O
ridiculously	O
hot	O
and	O
humid	O
inside,	O
the	O
staff	O
lacked	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O
motivation	O
for	O
good	O
customer	O
service,	O
and	O
they	O
crammed	O
the	O
7-	O
or	O
8-piece	O
band	O
in	O
the	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
bar	O
near	O
the	O
window,	O
making	O
for	O
awkward	O
viewing	O
and	O
playing.	O
The	O
sound	O
was	O
terrible	O
and	O
I	O
spent	O
more	O
time	O
outside	O
than	O
in.	O
	O
My	O
second	O
time	O
was	O
a	O
better	O
experience,	O
but	O
still	O
not	O
one	O
that	O
would	O
cause	O
me	O
to	O
suggest	O
other	O
people	O
go	O
there.	O
This	O
time	O
around	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
reasonable	O
temperature	O
in	O
the	O
bar,	O
but	O
that	O
may	O
only	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
50s	O
outside.	O
The	O
bands	O
played	O
in	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
the	O
bar	O
in	O
an	O
alcove/side	O
room	O
deal	O
and	O
it	O
made	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
sense.	O
The	O
sound	O
was	O
still	O
deafening	O

going	O
for	O
it.	O
Its	O
biggest	O
downsides:	O
-	O
it's	O
touted	O
as	O
a	O
blue-collar	O
bar,	O
but	O
it's	O
more	O
an	O
excuse	O
to	O
be	O
shabby	O
and	O
dirty	O
than	O
anything;	O

everywhere	O
had	O
a	O
15	O

didn't	O
have	O
any	O

me	O

:(	O
I'm	O
used	O
to	O
just	O
getting	O
whatever	O

everything,	O
but	O
no	O
such	O
luck.	O
However,	O
they	O
aren't	O
expensive	O
so	O
I	O
paid	O
about	O
4	O
dollars	O
for	O
a	O

about	O

it	O
does	O
about	O
my	O
(potentially)	O
overly-optimistic	O

has	O
gotten	O
quite	O
a	O
dramatic	O
face-lift.	O

great.	O
I	O
love	O
everything	O
they've	O
done	O

the	O

	O
I	O
tried	O
the	O
Tip	O
Top	O
Burger	O
and	O
the	O
chili	FOOD
.	O
The	O
burger	O
was	O
fine,	O
but	O
not	O
spectacular.	O
The	O
chili	FOOD
	O
was	O
really	O
freaking	O
delicious,	O
though.	O
I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend	O
grabbing	O
a	O
bowl	FOOD
	O
The	O
space	O
is	O
pretty	O
small,	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
actually	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
seating.	O
It	O
does	O
get	O
pretty	O
loud	O
though.	O
The	O
staff	O
members	O
were	O
all	O
very	O
nice	O
and	O
did	O
a	O
great	O
job.	O
The	O
bitchy	O
people	O
	O
next	O
to	O
us	O
were	O
treated	O
a	O
lot	O
nicer	O
than	O
they	O
deserved.	O
A	O
waiter	O
mixed	O
up	O
an	O
order	O
and	O
was	O
very	O
apologetic	O
and	O
quickly	O
resolved	O
the	O
issue.	O
	O
Overall,	O
I'm	O
happy	O
that	O
the	O
place	O
is	O
finally	O
open.	O
A	O
welcome	O
addition	O
to	O
the	O
neighborhood.I	O
love	O
that	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
this	O
classic	O
Wisconsin	O
tavern	O
was	O
preserved	O
whilst	O
providing	O
a	O
much-needed	O
facelift.	O
It's	O
a	O
great	O
addition	O
to	O
the	O
neighborhood.	O
	O
We	O
were	O
there	O
the	O
week	O
it	O
opened	O
and	O
I	O
enjoyed	O
a	O
few	O
creative	O
cocktails.	O
My	O
husband,	O
a	O
beer	FOOD
	O
aficionado,	O
loved	O
the	O

We	O
were	O
there	O
again	O
last	O
night	O
with	O
friends	O
for	O
the	O
fish	FOOD
	O
fry.	O
When	O
I	O
read	O
the	O
menu,	O
I	O
was	O
intrigued	O
by	O
the	O
Rooster	O
sandwich	FOOD
,	O
which	O
is	O
essentially	O
a	O
BLT	FOOD
	O
+	O
fried	O
egg	FOOD
.	O
I'm	O
so	O
glad	O
I	O
tried	O
this	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
fish	FOOD
	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
good.	O
It's	O
such	O
a	O
large	O
sandwich	FOOD
,	O
though,	O
it	O
is	O
probably	O
better	O
to	O
split	O
with	O
a	O
friend.	O
I	O
can't	O
believe	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
write	O
this,	O
but	O
there	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
TOO	O
much	O
bacon	FOOD

(although	O
I	O
managed	O
to	O

it	O

The	O

choice	FOOD

	O
Entertainment	O
is	O
hit	O
or	O
miss,	O
but	O
at	O
least	O
they	O
have	O
some.	O
	O
However,	O
my	O
favorite	O
reason	O
to	O
go	O
here	O
is	O
it	O
serves	O
the	O
coldest	O
tap	O
beer	FOOD
	O
We	O
had	O
burgers,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
good.	O
	O
The	O
menu	O
had	O
all	O
the	O
usual	O
pub	O
grub,	O
and	O
they	O
also	O
make	O
pizzas.	O
	O
Many	O
people	O
were	O
eating	O
them,	O
but	O
we	O
didn't	O
try	O
it,	O
so,	O
shrug.	O
	O
We	O
also	O
had	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
curds	FOOD
.	O
	O
They	O
were,	O
well,	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
curds	FOOD
	O
One	O
weird	O
thing	O
was	O
that	O
you	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bar	O
to	O
place	O
your	O
order.	O
	O
This	O
made	O
it	O
confusing	O
how	O
to	O
leave	O
a	O
tip.	O
	O
On	O
the	O
table,	O
or	O
with	O
the	O
person	O
you	O
placed	O
the	O
order	O
with?	O
	O
Overall,	O
we	O
enjoyed	O
it	O
here,	O
but	O
we	O
probably	O
wouldn't	O
come	O
back	O
during	O
dinner	O
hour,	O
as	O
the	O
atmosphere	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
weird	O
for	O
us.I	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Harmony	O
for	O
their	O
delicious	O
walnut	FOOD
	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
it's	O
definitely	O
more	O
of	O
an	O
older	O
crowd/neighborhood	O
bar	O
feel,	O
which	O
is	O
pretty	O
refreshing	O
from	O
the	O
bars	O
full	O
of	O
dbags	O
on	O
State	O
Street.	O
The	O
Harmony	O
is	O
a	O
solid	O
bar.I	O
just	O
want	O
to	O
mention	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
back	O
on	O
a	O
Sunday	O
afternoon	O
at	O
around	O
8:30.	O
	O
We	O
ordered	O
burgers	O
and	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
curds	FOOD
.	O
	O
They	O
tasted	O
a	O
lot	O
like	O
burgers	O
and	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
curds	FOOD
.	O
	O
I	O
also	O
don't	O
think	O
the	O
prices	O
are	O
that	O
great	O
on	O
further	O
reflection.	O
	O
6	O
dollars	O
for	O
a	O
stinkin	O
cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
But	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
kid	O
free	O
this	O
time.	O
	O
That's	O
nice.	O
	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
higher	O

but	O
some	O
drunk	O

yelled	O
at	O

from	O
the	O

instead	O
of	O
the	O

like	O
bars	O
that	O
are	O
a	O
little	O
rough	O
around	O

they	O
don't	O

	O

the	O

to	O

quite	O
nicely	O
in	O
the	O

	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
walnut	FOOD
	O
burger	O
and	O
an	O
order	O
of	O
their	O

	O
which	O
they	O

make	O
fresh.	O
	O
The	O

was	O
great.	O
	O
Large	O
but	O
not	O
too	O
large,	O
a	O

messy,	O
and	O
just	O
the	O
right	O
amount	O
of	O

	O
The	O

	O
were	O
great	O
too...	O
at	O

	O
Though	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
they	O
started	O
to	O
feel	O
a	O
bit	O
heavy	O
about	O
half	O
way	O
through.	O
	O
They're	O
still	O
good,	O
just	O
be	O
warned	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
eat	O
an	O
entire	O
thing	O
of	O

	O
your	O
heart	O
might	O
explode.If	O
I	O
could	O
give	O
the	O

less	O
than	O
one	O
star,	O
I	O
would.	O
I	O
live	O
in	O
the	O
Shenk-Atwood	O
neighborhood,	O
so	O
I'm	O
not	O
writing	O
as	O
an	O
outsider.	O
I've	O
been	O
to	O
the	O
Harmony	O
many	O

I'm	O
finally	O

abused	O
by	O
the	O
notoriously	O
unfriendly	O
owner,	O
bartenders	O
and	O
waitstaff	O
at	O
the	O
Harmony.	O
The	O
Harmony	O
is	O
worse	O
than	O
Seinfeld's	O
Soup	FOOD
	O
I	O
won't	O
get	O
into	O
specifics.	O
I	O
can	O
only	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
take	O
pride	O
in	O
my	O
neighborhood.	O
My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
frequent	O
those	O
establishments	O
that	O
understand	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
part	O
of	O
a	O
community	O
and	O
treat	O
their	O
paying	O
customers	O
as	O
such.	O
The	O
Harmony	O
is	O
a	O
black	O
mark	O
on	O
our	O
neighborhood,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
ashamed	O
that	O
unsuspecting	O
visitors	O
to	O
the	O
quaint	O
east	O
side	O
should	O
have	O
to	O
endure	O
the	O
abusive,	O
disrespectful	O
and	O
generally	O
unapologetic	O
service	O
at	O
this	O
establishment.	O
If	O

The	O

a	O

of	O

she	O
couldn't	O
have	O
been	O
more	O
rude	O
or	O
insulting.	O
When	O
we	O
all	O
said	O
we	O
wouldn't	O
be	O
back,	O
she	O
merely	O
shrugged	O
her	O
shoulders.	O
	O
If	O
you're	O
visiting	O
the	O
East	O
Side,	O
there	O
are	O
plenty	O
of	O

Alchemy,	O

also	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
I	O

Walnut	FOOD
	O
First,	O
you	O
should	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
Harmony	O
is	O
indeed	O
a	O
bar.	O
If	O
you	O
go	O
expecting	O
an	O
upscale	O
"gastro-pub"	O
experience	O
of	O
chic	O
bar	O
food,	O
then	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
disappointed.	O
There	O
are	O
no	O
waiters,	O
and	O
you	O
seat	O
yourself.	O
You	O
order	O
food	O
and	O
drinks	O
at	O
the	O
bar,	O
and	O
	O
a	O
food	O
runner	O
brings	O
out	O
your	O
order	O
when	O
it's	O
ready.	O
Its	O
got	O
a	O
dive	O
bar	O
atmosphere,	O
and	O
the	O
interior	O
is	O
pretty	O
run	O
down.	O
	O
After	O
fighting	O
for	O
a	O
table	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
crowd	O
that	O
was	O
rapidly	O
accumulating	O
in	O
anticipation	O
of	O
that	O
evening's	O
band,	O
my	O
friends	O
and	O
I	O
perused	O
the	O
menu.	O
It	O
contains	O
primarily	O
stereotypical	O
bar	O
food	O
(burgers,	O
fries	FOOD
,	O
onion rings	FOOD
,	O
etc),	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
few	O
exceptions.	O
There	O
are	O
several	O
vegetarian	O
options,	O
including	O
veggie	O
nachos	FOOD
,	O
so	O
if	O
you're	O
a	O
non	O
meat	FOOD
	O
eater,	O
you	O
would	O
probably	O
find	O
lots	O
of	O
things	O
to	O
order	O
at	O
The	O
Harmony.	O
Most	O
notably,	O
The	O
Harmony	O
offers	O
a	O
walnut	FOOD
	O
burger.	O
I'm	O
told	O
they're	O
famous	O
for	O
it,	O
so	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
walnut	FOOD
	O
burger	O
with	O
blue cheese	FOOD
	O
and	O
a	O
side	O
of	O
homemade	O
potato	FOOD
	O
chips	FOOD
	O
with	O
Bleu Cheese	FOOD
	O
Dip	FOOD
".	O
(What	O
can	O
I	O
say,	O
I	O
really,	O
really	O
love	O
Blue Cheese	FOOD
!)	O
It	O
took	O
awhile	O
for	O
the	O
food	O
to	O
come	O
out,	O
so	O
we	O
drank	O
beer	FOOD
	O
Onto	O
the	O
food:	O
The	O
blue cheese	FOOD
	O
walnut	FOOD
	O
burger	O
came	O
topped	O
with	O
a	O
creamy	O
blue cheese	FOOD
	O
sauce	O
in	O
addition	O
to	O
blue cheese	FOOD
	O
crumbles,	O
rather	O
than	O
plain	O
blue cheese	FOOD
	O
crumbles	O
like	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
anticipating.	O
It	O
also	O
came	O
with	O
onion	FOOD
,	O
lettuce	FOOD
,	O
tomato	FOOD
,	O
and	O
mayo	FOOD
.	O
The	O
lettuce	FOOD
	O
and	O
tomato	FOOD
	O
were	O
exceptionally	O
fresh	O
and	O
ripe	O
looking.	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
impressed,	O
especially	O
by	O
the	O
tomato	FOOD
	O
(it	O
was	O
actually	O
red!).	O
I	O
bit	O
into	O
it	O
and	O
was	O
immediately	O
transported	O
to	O
blue cheese	FOOD
	O
heaven.	O
It	O
was	O
fantastic.	O
I	O
will	O
qualify	O
this	O
praise	O
with	O
the	O
statement	O
that	O
the	O
reason	O
I	O
loved	O
this	O
burger	O
so	O
much	O
was	O
largely	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
the	O
copious	O
blue cheese	FOOD
	O
flavor	FOOD
.	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
sure	O
the	O
walnut	FOOD
	O
burger	O
itself	O
was	O
why	O
it	O
tasted	O
so	O
great.	O
The	O
chips	FOOD
	O
were	O
also	O
awesome.	O
They	O
arrived	O
piping	O
hot.	O
Some	O
were	O
crunchy	O
and	O
others	O
were	O
chewier.	O
It	O
was	O
clear	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
made	O
to	O
order.	O
The	O
Bleu Cheese	FOOD
	O
Dip	FOOD
	O
We	O
ate	O
as	O
the	O
band	O
played	O
and	O
just	O
reveled	O
in	O
how	O
fun	O
the	O
whole	O
experience	O
was.	O
By	O
the	O
way,	O
the	O
band	O
was	O
great!	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
Rockabilly	O
group	O
called	O
The	O
Fast	O
Clydes.	O
If	O
you	O
like	O
that	O
style	O
of	O
music,	O
I	O
couldn't	O
recommend	O
them	O
more.	O
They	O
had	O
a	O
ton	O
of	O
energy	O
and	O
knew	O
how	O
to	O
work	O
the	O
crowd.	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
blast.	O
	O
All	O
this	O
said,	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
few	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
The	O
Harmony	O
could	O
improve	O
upon.	O
First	O
off,	O
the	O
tables	O
in	O
the	O
main	O
dining	O
area	O
are	O
plastic.	O
They're	O
the	O
exact	O
same	O
tables	O
that	O
you	O
played	O
beer	FOOD
	O
pong	O
on	O
in	O
college.	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
The	O
Harmony	O
excels	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
its	O
dive	O
bar	O
atmosphere,	O
and	O
not	O
necessarily	O
because	O
of	O
it.	O
Therefore,	O
if	O
they	O
invested	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
money	O
to	O
spruce	O
up	O
the	O
interior,	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
would	O
see	O
a	O
return.	O
The	O
Atwood	O
area	O
is	O
still	O
rocking	O
that	O
hippie	O
vibe,	O
for	O
sure,	O
but	O
more	O
and	O
more,	O
I	O
am	O
noticing	O
newer	O
and	O
more	O
upscale	O
establishments.	O
To	O
me,	O
that	O
says	O
that	O
there's	O
probably	O
a	O
market	O
for	O
it	O
and	O
the	O
times,	O
they	O
are	O
a	O
changin'.	O
Also,	O
I	O
don't	O
mind	O
ordering	O
food	O

drinks	O
at	O
the	O

However,	O
I	O

	O
Thanks.I	O
stayed	O
away	O

after	O
a	O
business	O

forced	O
me	O
into	O
their	O
doors	O
multiple	O
nights,	O
I	O
gave	O
my	O
home	O
location	O
another	O
chance.	O
	O
The	O
food	O
is	O
predictable	O
but	O
getting	O
more	O
adventurous	O
over	O
the	O
years,	O
and	O
the	O
korean	O
tacos	FOOD
	O
are	O
pretty	O
exotic.	O
I	O
try	O
not	O
to	O
eat	O
here	O
without	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
nutritional	O
information	O
in	O
advance;	O
the	O
one	O
time	O
I	O
didn't,	O
I	O
ate	O
half	O
an	O
appetizer	FOOD
	O
(loaded	O
baked	O
potatoes	FOOD
)	O
and	O
a	O
salad	FOOD
	O
and	O
found	O
out	O
that	O
was	O
2100	O
calories.	O
There	O
were	O
also	O
pretty	O
substantial	O
delays	O
in	O

My	O
other	O
half	O
dozen	O
visits	O
have	O
had	O
excellent	O
service	O
and	O
well	O
prepared	O
food.	O
Maybe	O
the	O
staff	O
wasn't	O
at	O
its	O
best	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
here	O
on	O
New Year	FOOD
	O
Though	O
I	O
seldom	O
use	O
it,	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
nice	O
drink	O
list,	O
especially	O
if	O
you're	O
a	O
fan	O
of	O
tequila	FOOD
.	O
It's	O
also	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
few	O

I	O
know	O
that	O
offers	O
reward	O
points	O
for	O
eating	O
there.	O
All	O
in	O
all,	O
I	O
choose	O
to	O
go	O
here	O
for	O
a	O
standard	O
night	O
out	O
with	O
people	O
who	O
can't	O
agree	O
on	O
what	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
eat.The	O
Korean	O
tacos	FOOD
	O
are	O
not	O
half	O
bad,	O
and	O
the	O
kid	O
really	O
likes	O
the	O
burgers.My	O
boyfriend	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
here	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
$25	O
gift	O
card	O
and	O
thought	O
we'd	O
get	O
a	O
cheap	O
meal.	O
Too	O
bad	O
TGI	O
Fridays	O
is	O
incredibly	O
overpriced.	O
Maybe	O
it's	O
my	O
own	O
fault	O
for	O
choosing	O
something	O
besides	O
a	O
hamburger	FOOD
,	O
but	O
the	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
dinner	O
I	O
ordered	O
was	O
just	O
awful.	O
It	O
was	O
clearly	O
a	O
frozen	O

they	O
just	O
heated	O
up	O
(I	O
asked	O
for	O
no	O
mushrooms	FOOD
	O
and	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
wasn't	O
possible).	O
I	O
know	O
many	O
restaurants	O
do	O
this,	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
get	O
a	O
$50	O

I	O
could	O
have	O

that	O

all	O
night	O
in	O
the	O
bathroom	O
after	O

	O
I	O
think	O
that's	O
because	O
my	O

they	O

because	O
the	O

doesn't	O
fall	O

all	O
the	O

have	O
been	O
highly	O
reviewed	O
so	O
I	O
actually	O
went	O
for	O
the	O
full	O
slab.	O
	O
Then	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
choice	FOOD
	O
between	O
the	O
chopped	O
pork	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
and	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
,	O
I	O
went	O
for	O
the	O
pork	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
from	O
my	O
fond	O
memories	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
in	O
Alabama.	O
	O
Ordering	O
over	O
the	O
phone,	O
everything	O
seemed	O
to	O
go	O
well.	O
	O
I	O
then	O
arrived	O
about	O
a	O
half	O
hour	O
later.	O
	O
There	O
was	O
1	O
person	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
me	O
who	O
paid	O
and	O
was	O
getting	O
ready	O
to	O
leave	O
when	O
they	O
brought	O
my	O
order	O
to	O
the	O
counter	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
clearly	O
wrong.	O
	O
They	O
had	O
given	O
my	O
order	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
before	O
me	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
his.	O
	O
Apparently	O
we	O
both	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
first	O
name.	O
	O
Now	O
this	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
perturbed	O
by	O
and	O
was	O
okay	O
with,	O
it	O
was	O
what	O
followed	O
that	O
made	O
me	O
give	O
this	O
place	O
1	O
star.	O
	O
So	O
the	O
counter	O
lady	O
tells	O
me	O
she'll	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
me	O
first	O
before	O
resolving	O
his	O
issue,	O
great!	O
	O
So	O
she	O
charges	O
my	O
card	O
for	O
64.66	O
which	O
was	O
clearly	O
way	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
paid	O
for	O
1	O
slab	O
dinner	O
and	O
1	O
pork	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
+	O
1	O
side	O
of	O
fried	O
dough	FOOD
.	O
	O
Should	O
have	O
been	O
1/2	O
that.	O
	O
I	O
told	O
her	O
and	O
she	O
couldn't	O
understand	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
talking	O
about,	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
over-explain	O
what	O
I	O
ordered	O
and	O
finally	O
got	O
through	O
to	O
her.	O
	O
She	O
took	O
the	O
bag	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
kitchen	O
area	O
saying	O
some	O
guy	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
fixing	O
this	O
problem.	O
	O
Now	O
I	O
was	O
getting	O
irritated.	O
	O
She	O
refunds	O
me	O
around	O
32	O
bucks	FOOD
	O
So	O
I	O
come	O
back	O
and	O
begin	O
with	O
the	O
ribs,	O
1/2	O
a	O
slab.	O
	O
From	O
the	O
first	O
taste	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
impressed.	O
	O
I've	O
had	O
better	O
ribs	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
country	O
from	O
Los	O
Angeles	O
to	O
Alabama	O
to	O
Texas	O
and	O
Chicago.	O
	O
Seriously?	O
	O
This	O
place	O
has	O
won	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
awards,	O
I	O
don't	O
get	O
it.	O
	O
Almost	O
every	O
other	O
place	O
I've	O
eaten	O
ribs	O
in	O
my	O
40+	O
years	O
of	O
life	O
has	O
been	O
better	O
than	O
this	O
place.	O
	O
The	O
sugar	FOOD
-fried"	O
biscuits	FOOD
	O
are	O
nothing	O
with	O
nothing,	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
better	O
donuts	O
nearly	O
anywhere,	O
seriously	O
(again).	O
	O
The	O
fries	FOOD
	O
dipped	O
in	O
the	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
sauce	O
were	O
the	O
best	O
part	O
by	O
far.	O
	O
The	O
corn	FOOD
	O
was	O
pretty	O
good	O
too,	O
but	O
still	O
a	O
little	O
over	O
the	O
top	O
on	O
the	O
taste,	O
hard	O
to	O
describe.	O
	O
So	O
after	O
being	O
disappointed,	O
I	O
checked	O
out	O
the	O
pork	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
,	O
and	O
oddly	O
enough	O
there	O
were	O
3	O
small	O
containers	FOOD
	O
with	O
the	O
sandwich	FOOD
,	O
and	O
somehow	O
it	O
didn't	O
look	O
like	O
pork	FOOD
	O
either.	O
	O
I	O
examined	O
further,	O
it	O
was	O
chicken	FOOD
,	O
yet	O
another	O
screw-up	O
with	O
my	O
order,	O
wow!	O
	O
And	O
I	O
ordered	O
fries	FOOD
	O
and	O
mashed potatoes	FOOD
,	O
neither	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
included.	O
	O
Instead	O
I	O
found	O
off-the-shelf	O
beans	FOOD
,	O
apple sauce	FOOD
	O
(why?)	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
homemade,	O
just	O
spooned	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
jar,	O
and	O
the	O
third	O
container	O
was	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
sauce,	O
which	O
I	O
didn't	O
need	O
since	O
I	O
bought	O
a	O
whole	O
bottle	FOOD
.	O
	O
So	O
the	O
other	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
order	O
was	O
completely	O
wrong	O
in	O
every	O
respect.	O
	O
And	O
note,	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
was	O
not	O
anything	O
to	O
write	O
home	O
about	O
either.	O
	O
I	O
drove	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
Madison,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
fairly	O
pleasant	O
1/2	O
hour	O
drive,	O
paid	O
around	O
33	O
bucks	FOOD
	O
I	O
strongly	O
recommend	O
NOT	O
going	O
to	O
this	O
place,	O
unless	O
you	O
like	O
to	O
take	O
risks,	O
maybe	O
you'll	O
like	O
what	O
you	O
find,	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
in	O
Madison,	O
I'll	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
elsewhere	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
to	O
find	O
good	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
Oh	O
well...Great	O
BBQ	FOOD
It's	O
a	O
little	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way,	O
but	O
worth	O
the	O
journey	O
if	O
you're	O
looking	O
for	O
decent	O
BBQ	FOOD
I	O
don't	O
remember	O
seeing	O
any	O
highchairs.	O
	O
We	O
ended	O
up	O

While	O

Smoky	O

for	O
the	O

The	O
brisket	FOOD
	O

	O
was	O
delicious	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
pretty	O
sure	O
I	O
would	O
eat	O
a	O

little	O
too	O
sweet.	O
	O
Review	O
was	O
so	O
close	O
to	O

on	O
a	O
Monday;	O
oops,	O
not	O
open.	O
After	O
10	O
months	O
of	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
Madison	O
area,	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
THE	O
RIB	O
PLACE.	O
The	O
ribs	O
are	O
great,	O
so	O
is	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
,	O
the	O
corn	FOOD
,	O

...you	O
get	O
the	O
idea.	O
The	O
restaurant	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
small	O
but	O
the	O
service	O
was	O
amazing.	O
Watching	O
my	O
family	O
eat	O
was	O
almost	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
the	O
food,	O
almost.	O
I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
Smoky	O
Jon's	O
#1	O
BBQ	FOOD
.1/2	O
slab	O
and	O
pork	FOOD
	O
shoulder	O
with	O
sugar	FOOD
	O

biscuits	FOOD
	O
and	O
garlic	FOOD
	O
mashed potatoes	FOOD
.	O
We	O
need	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
in	O
Philadelphia.	O
The	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
was	O
so	O
tender	O
and	O
flavorful.	O
	O
Sides	O
were	O
good	O
but	O
not	O
as	O
amazing	O
as	O
the	O
meat	FOOD
.	O
Will	O
definitely	O
be	O
back	O
to	O
try	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
Pork	FOOD
	O
ribs	O
are	O
amazing.	O
I've	O
had	O
ribs	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
US	O
and	O
the	O
ones	O
here	O
compare	O
favorably	O
with	O
all	O
of	O
them.	O
The	O
meat	FOOD
	O
falls	O
off	O
of	O
the	O
bones	O
and	O
have	O
a	O
smoky	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
The	O
beef	FOOD
	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
and	O
pork	FOOD
	O
shoulder	O
are	O
fairly	O
average.This	O
is	O
pretty	O
good	O
bbq	FOOD
I	O
haven't	O
been	O
everywhere	O
in	O
town,	O
but	O
honestly	O
I	O
think	O
Famous	O
Dave's	O
is	O
better.	O
	O
Basically	O
its	O
decent	O
food,	O
but	O
if	O
you've	O
had	O
real	O
bbq	FOOD
	O
somewhere	O
like	O
memphis,	O
kansas	O
city,	O
st.	O
louis,	O
or	O
anywhere	O
south	O
of	O
wisconsin,	O
	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
disappointed.Well	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
tough	O
one.	O
A	O
few	O
years	O
back,	O
I	O
stopped	O
going	O
to	O
SJ'sbecause	O
I	O
was	O
sick	O
of	O
getting	O
rubbery	O
non	O
tender	O
ribs.	O
In	O
the	O
90's,	O
you	O
could	O
always	O
count	O
on	O
getting	O
the	O
BEST	O
ribs	O
around,	O
EVERY	O
time.	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Jon	O
worked	O
there	O
then	O
made	O
the	O
difference.	O
Since	O
he	O
retired,	O
I	O
dont	O
know	O
what	O
happened	O
exactly?	O
However,	O
recently	O
I	O
stopped	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
shoulder	O
platter,	O
and	O
everything	O
was	O
great,	O
so	O
go	O
figure.	O
The	O
sauce	O
is	O
fantastic,	O
and	O
when	O
done	O
well,	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
something	O
special.Went	O
here	O
with	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
friends	O
after	O
work	O
one	O
night.	O
	O
We	O
'd	O
been	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
The	O
first	O
thing	O
that	O
struck	O
me	O
was	O
the	O
great	O
atmosphere	O
in	O
the	O
restaurant.	O
	O
It's	O
a	O
small	O
place,	O
maybe	O
15	O
tables	O
total,	O
and	O
there's	O
blues	O
music	O
playing	O
in	O
the	O
background.	O
	O
We	O
put	O
our	O
order	O
in	O
at	O
the	O
front	O
window	O
and	O
then	O
grabbed	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
tables.	O
	O
We	O
grabbed	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
tables	O
and	O
didn't	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
very	O
long	O
before	O
our	O
food	O
was	O
brought	O
out.	O
	O
Oh	O
was	O
the	O
food	O
good.	O
	O
I	O
ordered	O
a	O
1/3	O
slab	O
of	O
ribs	O
and	O
the	O
pulled pork	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
combo	O
platter.	O
	O
The	O
pork	FOOD
	O
was	O
piled	O
on	O
it's	O
bun	FOOD
	O
in	O
plentiful	O
quantities.	O
	O
It	O
was	O
pretty	O
good,	O
the	O
pork	FOOD
	O
had	O
good	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
and	O
my	O
only	O
complaint	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
wasn't	O
quite	O
as	O
tender	O
and	O
juicy	O
as	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
homemade	O
stuff	O
I've	O
had.	O
	O
The	O
ribs,	O
though,	O
were	O
amazing.	O
	O
The	O
meat	FOOD
	O
was	O
incredibly	O
tender.	O
	O
More	O
importantly,	O
though,	O
was	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
meat	FOOD
	O
on	O
each	O
bone	FOOD
.	O
	O
I'm	O
used	O
to	O
seeing	O
skimpy	O
ribs	O
get	O
served	O
at	O
restaurants	O
where	O
you're	O
left	O
wanting	O
more	O
after	O
a	O
full	O
rack	FOOD
.	O
	O
Here,	O
in	O
just	O
4	O
bones	O
I	O
found	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
full.	O
	O
Smoky	O
Jon's	O
sauce	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
compliment	O
to	O
the	O
meat	FOOD
	O
as	O
well.	O
	O
Good	O
full	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
The	O
sides	O
were	O
equally	O
excellent.	O
	O
The	O
baked beans	FOOD
	O
are	O
a	O
must,	O
and	O
I	O
saved	O
mine	O
for	O
the	O
end	O
so	O
that's	O
the	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
I	O
would	O
leave	O
with.	O
	O
I	O
also	O
had	O
the	O
sugar	FOOD
	O
fried	O
biscuits	FOOD
	O
The	O
highlight	O
of	O
the	O
meal,	O
though,	O
was	O
something	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
friends	O
had	O
ordered.	O
	O
The	O
restaurant	O
also	O
had	O
chili	FOOD
	O
available	O
(which	O
may	O
just	O
be	O
a	O
seasonal	O
item).	O
	O
It	O
was	O
served	O
with	O
a	O
fork	FOOD
	O
rather	O
than	O
a	O
spoon,	O
and	O
with	O
good	O
reason.	O
	O
I've	O
never	O
seen	O
chili	FOOD
	O
that	O
was	O
that	O
thick	O
and	O
meaty.	O
	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
taste	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
was	O
floored	O
by	O
how	O
great	O
the	O
flavors	O
were.	O
	O
It	O
was	O
so	O
good	O
that	O
I	O
almost	O
went	O
back	O
up	O
to	O
order	O
some	O
chili	FOOD
	O
Smoky	O

ordering,	O
so	O
kudos	O
to	O
the	O
service	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
dead	O
on.	O
	O
It	O
was	O
less	O
of	O
a	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
and	O
more	O
of	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
on	O
a	O
plain	O
roll.	O
	O
That's	O
fine	O
of	O
course,	O
but	O
for	O
some	O
reason	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
doesn't	O
describe	O
this	O
well.	O
	O
It	O
does	O
remind	O
me	O
of	O
the	O
bare	O
minimum	O
approach	O
you	O
find	O
in	O
many	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
joints	O
around,	O
but	O
I	O
don't	O
like	O
it	O
there	O
either.	O
	O
Anyway,	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
was	O
very	O
tasty	O
and	O
you	O
should	O
just	O
order	O
it	O
on	O
its	O
own.	O
	O
No	O
point	O
in	O
getting	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
bread	FOOD
	O
that	O
just	O
hides	O
the	O
taste	O
of	O
good	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
Spicy	O
Corn	FOOD
	O
=	O
Awesome.	O
	O
Truly	O
delicious	O
stuff,	O
and	O
I	O
plowed	O

it	O
in	O
30	O
seconds.	O
	O
Perfect	O
amount	O
of	O

	O
Baked Beans	FOOD
	O
=	O
Awesome.	O
	O
I	O
asked	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
made	O
in	O
house,	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
and	O
my	O
palate	O
was	O
rewarded	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
finest	O
baked beans	FOOD
	O
one	O
can	O
find.	O
	O
Thick,	O
almost	O
pasty	FOOD
	O
(in	O
a	O
good	O
way)	O
and	O
chock	O
full	O
of	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
The	O
only	O
downfalls	O
would	O
be	O
that	O
it's	O
somewhat	O
pricey	O
for	O
what	O
you	O
get,	O
but	O
food	O
is	O
going	O
up	O
everywhere.	O
	O
I	O
also	O
ordered	O
a	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
The	O
service	O
was	O
top	O
notch.	O
	O
Everything	O
and	O
more	O
was	O
explained	O
to	O
me	O
in	O
detail.	O
	O
I	O
only	O
have	O
myself	O
to	O
blame	O
for	O
trying	O
that	O
damn	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
The	O
decor	O
is	O
nice	O
and	O
very	O
'southern'	O
in	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
without	O
a	O
doubt	O
a	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
I	O
got	O
mine	O
to	O
go	O

probably	O
the	O

I	O

And	O
everything	O
is	O
very	O
smokey	O

which,	O
for	O
me,	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
thing.	O
I	O

the	O
chicken	FOOD

(awesome)	O
and	O

	O
For	O
the	O

the	O

This	O
was	O

for	O

the	O

the	O

was	O

Finally,	O
I	O

the	O

that	O
I	O

In	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
to	O

For	O
what	O
it's	O

I	O
don't	O
think	O
the	O
1	O
woman	O
on	O

was	O
to	O

The	O

really	O
threw	O
her	O

There's	O

There	O
was	O

What	O

one	O

at	O

	O
My	O

I'd	O
absolutely	O
come	O

	O

with	O

;)For	O
Madison,	O
this	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
The	O
food's	O
good,	O
the	O
staff	O
is	O
friendly,	O
and	O
(for	O
freshly-made	O
BBQ	FOOD
)	O
the	O
service	O
is	O
usually	O
quick.So...this	O
is	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
food	O
that	O
will	O
kill	O
you.	O
So	O
there's	O
that.	O
But	O
that	O
being	O
said,	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
I	O
can	O
think	O
of	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
food	O
with	O
absolutely	O
no	O
nutritional	O
value.	O
The	O

The	O
rolls	O
are	O
airy	O
buttery	FOOD
	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
best	O
for	O
carryout.	O
You	O
can	O
sit	O
and	O
eat	O
-	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
tables,	O
but	O
then	O
there	O
are	O
also	O
bullet	O
holes	O
in	O
the	O
windows.	O
Since	O
it's	O
Madison,	O
I'm	O
assuming	O
someone	O
put	O
them	O
there	O
for	O
show,	O
but	O
definitely	O
with	O
a	O
real	O
gun,	O
so	O
anyway	O
I'd	O
rather	O
eat	O
at	O
home.	O
	O
Also,	O
if	O
you've	O
been	O
doing	O
the	O
House	O
of	O
Cards	O
thing	O
and	O
want	O
that	O

	O
experience	O
but	O
you	O
don't	O

in	O
the	O
south,	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
closest	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
get.	O
So,	O
check	O
it	O
out	O
Madison,	O
it's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
different	O
but	O
that	O
doesn't	O
mean	O
it	O
isn't	O
fabulous!Delicious	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
We	O
got	O
the	O
half	O
slab	O
and	O
jumbo	O
1/2	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
dinner	O
to	O
share,	O
which	O
was	O
huge!	O
Big	O
portions,	O
but	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
was	O
really	O
dry.	O
The	O
ribs	O
were	O
amazing.	O
We	O
also	O
ordered	O
some	O
beef	FOOD
	O
brisket	FOOD
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
much	O
smaller	O
portion	O
than	O
the	O
ribs	O
and	O
chicken	FOOD
.	O
If	O
you're	O
not	O
a	O
fan	O
of	O
fatty	FOOD
	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
(like	O
me)	O
than	O
you'll	O
be	O
quite	O
happy	O
with	O
their	O
brisket	FOOD
.	O
No	O
awkward	O
moments	O
of	O
biting	O
into	O
a	O
string	FOOD
	O
of	O
fat	O
and	O
trying	O
to	O
spit	O
it	O
out	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
your	O
date	FOOD
	O
The	O
sides,	O
overall,	O
could	O
be	O
better.	O
But	O
lets	O
be	O
honest,	O
you're	O
not	O
here	O
for	O
the	O
sides.	O
If	O
you	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
order	O
any	O
sides	O
you'll	O
save	O
about	O
a	O
buck	FOOD
,	O
but	O
it's	O
worth	O
it	O
to	O
venture	O
out	O
and	O
try	O
them.	O
The	O
baked beans	FOOD
	O
were	O
iffy.	O
I	O
heard	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
good	O
things	O
about	O
them	O
via	O
Yelp,	O
but	O
ours	O
were	O
grey-ish	O
and	O
tasted	O
off.	O
The	O
potato salad	FOOD
	O
is	O
definitely	O
full	O
fat	O
and	O
more	O
mayo	FOOD
	O
based.	O
It's	O
a	O
nice	O
and	O
cool	O
way	O
to	O
offset	O
the	O
kick	O
of	O
BBQ	FOOD
.	O
The	O
french fries	FOOD
	O
are	O
more	O
run-of-the-mill	O
than	O
anything	O
else	O
here.	O
We	O
also	O
tried	O
the	O
fried	O
biscuits	FOOD
	O
after	O
seeing	O
so	O
many	O
people	O
rave	O
about	O
them.	O
Maybe	O
I	O
had	O
too	O
high	O
of	O
expectations?	O
They	O
were	O
good,	O
they	O
tasted	O
a	O
bit	O
like	O
carnival	FOOD
	O
The	O
sauce	O
here	O
is	O
unlike	O
any	O
other	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
Definitely	O
go	O
for	O
the	O
ribs.	O
The	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
is	O
good.	O
Chicken	FOOD
	O
could	O
be	O
better.	O
The	O
sides	O
are	O
hit	O
or	O
miss.	O
We	O
got	O
take-out	O
since	O
the	O

	O
The	O

	O
The	O

it	O

carrot	FOOD
	O
matchsticks.	O
	O
The	O
Garlic	FOOD

there	O

perhaps	O
a	O
small	O
ice cream	FOOD
	O
scoop	O
(like,	O

	O

	O
I	O

on,	O
it	O

	O
My	O

it	O

was	O
moist	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

the	O

was	O
quite	O

with	O
the	O
meat	FOOD

	O
The	O
creamy	O

	O
The	O

were	O
the	O
best	O
thing	O
on	O
the	O

(maybe	O
it's	O
because	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O

	O
very	O
often),	O
but	O
these	O

	O
were	O
just	O
okay.	O
	O
The	O

was	O
just	O
bagged	O
romaine lettuce	FOOD

They	O

a	O

The	O

the	O

The	O

from	O
the	O

The	O

the	O

the	O
meat	FOOD

easily	O

There	O
was	O
an	O

of	O

to	O
deepen	O
its	O
flavor	FOOD

and	O
that	O
was	O
further	O

provide	O
a	O
sweet	O
higher	O
note,	O
strong	O

	O
The	O

	O

The	O

without	O

	O
The	O
first	O

was	O
a	O
few	O
years	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
and	O
ribs.	O
	O
The	O
ribs	O
were	O
really	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
was	O
decent.	O
	O
It	O
was	O
the	O
flat	O
and	O
was	O
cut	O
thin,	O
probably	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
touch	O
dry.	O
	O
It	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
The	O
second	O
time	O
was	O
this	O
month	O
(July	O
2014)	O
and	O
I	O
got	O
the	O

	O

	O
The	O
baked beans	FOOD
	O
were	O

	O
Nothing	O
special,	O
but	O
tasted	O
fine.	O
	O
The	O
Mac-n	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
was	O
pretty	O
good.	O
	O
There	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
cheese sauce	FOOD
	O
in	O

	O
I	O
like	O
a	O

,	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
thick	O

creamy,	O
which	O
is	O
OK.	O
	O
The	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
was	O
great.	O
	O
It	O
wasn't	O
cut	O

had	O
a	O

was	O
easily	O
pulled	O
apart	O

	O
In	O
other	O
words	O
it	O
was	O
tender	O

not	O
dry	O
at	O
all.	O
	O
Much	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
first	O

I	O
visited.	O
	O
My	O
only	O
complaint	O
would	O
be	O
they	O
put	O
sauce	O
on	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
.	O
	O
I	O
prefer	O
sauce	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
because	O
good	O
barbeque	FOOD
	O
doesn't	O
need	O
sauce	O
and	O
this	O

	O
didn't	O
need	O
sauce.Jon's	O

I	O
can	O

the	O

I	O
would	O
agree	O
with	O
a	O

that	O

it's	O
not	O
the	O

	O

passed	O
our	O
table	O
several	O
times	O
and	O
never	O
once	O
asked	O
us	O
how	O
was	O
the	O
food	O
or	O
why	O
our	O
orders	O
were	O
taking	O
so	O
long.	O
Not	O
once.	O
	O
She	O
was	O
a	O
horrible	O
waitress.	O
	O
Neither	O
my	O
mother	O
or	O
I	O
could	O
finish	O
our	O
food.	O
I	O
took	O
possibly	O
4	O
bites	O
and	O
was	O
done.	O
We	O
spent	O
less	O
time	O
eating	O
then	O
we	O
did	O
waiting	O
and	O
ordering.	O
Waitress	O
continued	O
to	O
ignore	O
us,	O
so	O
we	O
got	O
up	O
and	O
just	O
walked	O
over	O
to	O
pay.	O
	O
I	O
told	O
the	O
cashier	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
horrible	O
and	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
be	O
back.	O
She	O
then	O
stated	O
to	O
us	O
that	O
normally	O
the	O
food	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
she	O
wasn't	O
sure	O
why	O
it	O
was	O
taking	O
the	O
kitchen	O
so	O
long	O
and	O
were	O
getting	O
orders	O
wrong.	O
	O
	O
But	O
here	O
is	O
the	O
killer...	O
she	O
then	O
leans	O
over	O
and	O
says	O
"	O
I	O
hate	O
our	O
kitchen	O
staff,	O
we	O
need	O
new	O
ones"	O
	O
What	O

	O
Just	O
a	O
horrible	O
business,	O
not	O

and	O
food	O
is	O
beyond	O
pathetic.	O
Do	O
not	O
go	O

I	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O

I've	O
had	O
a	O

they	O

	O
That	O
is	O
all	O
a	O

because	O
the	O

50's	O

	O
What	O

	O

I	O

the	O

thing	O
that	O

the	O

	O
It's	O
very	O

a	O

sweet.	O
Every	O
time	O
I	O

to	O

I	O
need	O
to	O
stop	O
here	O
for	O
some	O

The	O
chocolate	FOOD
	O
pecan	FOOD
	O
is	O
my	O
favorite.I	O
like	O
this	O
place.	O
	O
Nothing	O
super	O
special,	O
but	O
still	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
custard	FOOD
	O
places	O
in	O
town.	O
	O
I	O
always	O

a	O

	O
We	O
came	O
here	O
at	O
about	O
9:30	O
on	O
a	O
Thursday	O
night	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
dead.	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
were	O
expecting	O
a	O
normal	O
ice cream	FOOD
	O
shop	O
kind	O
of	O
atmosphere,	O
with	O
a	O
big	O
case	O
of	O
flavors	O
to	O
look	O
at,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
deer	FOOD
-in-headlights	O
moment	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
walked	O
in,	O
trying	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
supposed	O
to	O
order.	O
It	O
turns	O
out	O
they	O
only	O
have	O
3	O
flavors	O
(vanilla,	O
chocolate	FOOD
,	O
and	O
one	O
other)	O
per	O
day,	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
your	O
choices	O
come	O
from	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
sundae	O
you	O
get.	O
Once	O
we	O
figured	O
that	O
out,	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
sundae	O
choices	O
seemed	O
pretty	O
solid.	O
I	O
ended	O
up	O
going	O
with	O
Turtle	FOOD
,	O
and	O
my	O
husband	O
got	O
the	O
Peanut Butter	FOOD
	O
Cup.	O
Both	O
were	O
excellent.	O
The	O
chocolate	FOOD
	O
shell	O
on	O
the	O
PBC	O
was	O
nicely	O
chocolaty,	O
especially	O
for	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
product,	O
and	O
I	O
appreciated	O
that	O
they	O
didn't	O
skimp	O
on	O
the	O
pecans	FOOD
	O
for	O
the	O
Turtle	FOOD
.	O
We	O
both	O
had	O
smalls,	O
which	O
were	O
QUITE	O
ample.	O
We	O
also	O
got	O
a	O
K9	O
custard	FOOD
	O
I	O
guess	O
I	O
just	O
have	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
objections	O
that	O
keep	O
this	O
from	O
being	O
a	O
4-star	O
place.	O
First,	O
I	O
wish	O
they	O
had	O
more	O
flavors,	O
since	O
I	O
don't	O
always	O
want	O
a	O
sundae	O
(but	O
maybe	O
this	O
is	O
characteristic	O
of	O
frozen	O
custard	FOOD
	O
joints	O
and	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
fair	O
criticism).	O
Second,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
served	O
slightly	O
colder	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
doesn't	O
melt	FOOD
	O
as	O
fast	O
when	O
the	O
hot	O
fudge	FOOD
	O
hits	O
it.	O
Third,	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
overpriced	O
for	O
a	O
fast food	FOOD
-style	O
place.	O
This	O
is	O
especially	O
true	O
of	O
the	O
K9	O
custard	FOOD
,	O
since	O
we're	O
used	O
to	O
getting	O
something	O
more	O
along	O
the	O
lines	O
of	O
a	O
79-cent	O
kiddie	O
cone	O
for	O
the	O
dog.	O
We'll	O
probably	O
be	O
back,	O
since	O
its	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood,	O
but	O
this	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
last	O
frozen	O
dessert	FOOD
	O
purveyor	O
I	O
visit	O
in	O
Madison.Stick	O
with	O
Culvers!	O
	O
My	O
family	O
and	O
I	O
stopped	O
by	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
biking	O
around	O
the	O
lake.	O
What	O
a	O
rude	O
and	O
disappointing	O
experience.	O
First	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
staff	O
who	O
waited	O
on	O
us,	O
Andrea	O
was	O
short	O
tempered	O
and	O
not	O
into	O
customer	O
service.	O
We	O
tried	O
to	O
order	O
swirl,	O
but	O
they	O
don't	O
have	O
it,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
solution,	O
Andrea	O
just	O
said	O
no.	O
We	O
ordered	O
a	O
cone,	O
small	O
sundae	O
and	O
a	O
can	O
of	O
coke.	O
About	O
$10.00	O
later,	O
I	O
was	O
grudging	O
given	O
a	O
glass	FOOD
	O
filled	O
about	O
1/3	O
full	O
of	O
ice	FOOD
	O
for	O
my	O
not	O
very	O
chilled	O
coke.	O
The	O
custard	FOOD
	O
is	O
ok,	O
but	O
nothing	O
special.	O
Another	O
option	O
would	O
to	O
be	O
to	O
continue	O
on	O
the	O
bike	O
path.	O
In	O
Monona	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
ice cream	FOOD
	O
Maybe	O
it's	O
because	O
I	O
didn't	O
try	O
the	O
custard	FOOD
.	O
But	O
seriously,	O
I	O
didn't	O
need	O
more	O
weighing	O
down	O
in	O
this	O
weather...so	O
I	O
ordered	O
an	O
orange	O
crush	FOOD
	O
float	O
instead.	O
For	O
something	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
cost	O
me	O
MAYBE	O
50cents	O
to	O
make	O
at	O
home,	O
I	O
paid	O
close	O
to	O
$5	O
for	O
a	O
12oz	O
cup.	O
That	O
is	O
ridiculous.	O
In	O
general,	O
I	O
think	O
their	O
prices	O
are	O
pretty	O
steep	O
for	O
what	O
you	O
get....you'd	O
probably	O
have	O
to	O
order	O
a	O
burger	O
to	O
really	O
get	O
a	O
bang	FOOD
	O
for	O
your	O
buck	FOOD
	O
Like	O
RB,	O
I	O
also	O
had	O
an	O
issue	O
with	O
the	O
service.	O
It	O
was	O
slow,	O
disorganized,	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
friendly.	O
The	O
line	O
was	O
almost	O
out	O
the	O
door,	O
but	O
the	O
employees	O
behind	O
the	O
counter	O
didn't	O
even	O
ATTEMPT	O
to	O
speed	O
up	O
the	O
service.	O
One	O
of	O
them	O
just	O
disappeared	O
into	O
a	O
back	O
room.	O
tsktsk.	O
I	O
also	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
hilarious	O
how	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
employees	O
crumpled	O
up	O
an	O
order	O
form	O
before	O
the	O
order	O
had	O
been	O
completed,	O
and	O
then	O
had	O
to	O
UNcrumple	O
the	O
paper	O
so	O
she	O
could	O
re-read	O
the	O
order	O
to	O
her	O
coworker.	O
Really?	O
	O
Anyway,	O
I	O
will	O
probably	O
give	O
the	O
Monroe	O
St.	O
Michael's	O
-	O
and	O
their	O
custards/burgers	O

a	O
shot,	O
