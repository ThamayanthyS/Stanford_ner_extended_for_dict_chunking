A
word
of
advice
--
LEAVE
ROOM
FOR
DESSERT	FOOD
!
the
deserters
are
great
but
huge
!
Plan
to
bring
some
homeOne
of
my
favorite
truck
stop
diners
with
solid
food	FOOD
and
friendly
,
quick
service
.
My
god
,
those
desserts
are
huge
!
I
ca
n't
imagine
eating
that
giant
cream	FOOD
puff
.
All
the
food	FOOD
we
had
was
delicious
and
I
love
how
they
leave
a
carafe	FOOD
of
coffee	FOOD
on
the
table
.
Love
this
place
.
Would
definitely
be
back
if
I
was
in
the
area!Only
went
here
once
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
,
but
they
had
great
pancakes
!
My
only
problem
with
it
at
the
time
was
that
they
allowed
smoking
,
so
I
left
smelling
like
a
cigarette	FOOD
.
With
the
change
in
law
,
I
'm
sure
the
atmosphere
has
improved!Great
truck
stop
restaurant
.
I
've
had
breakfast	FOOD
and
dinner	FOOD
here
and
it
has
always
been
good
.
Huge
portions
and
reasonable
prices
.
The
bakery
I
guess
is
legendary
.
They
have
doughnuts	FOOD
the
size
of
your
head
!
Eclairs	FOOD
the
size
of
your
arm
and
Cream	FOOD
Puffs
that
are
about
10
''
high
.
On
our
most
recent
trip
in
the
area
,
stopped
at
the
gas	FOOD
station
attached
to
the
restaurant
fo
some
quick
snacks
and
of
course

If
you
are
driving
by
and
see
the
sign
for
The
Pine
Cone
Restaurant
-
Take
the
next
off
ramp
and
stop
it.Yeah
,
thats
right
a
five
freakin
star
rating
.
Five
Star
Truck
Stop
Dining
At
Its
Finest
.
Be
prepared
to
eat
.
I
was
first
introduced
to
the
Pine
Cone
at
its
Johnson
Creek
location
years
ago
and
freaked
out
at
the
size
of
the
awesome
,
delicious
desserts
.
Then
on
a
recent
road
trip
someone
mentioned
about
eating
at
the
Pine
Cone
,
I
thought
is
there
really
more
than
one
?
I
looked
out
the
window
to
see
exactly
where
we
were
at
and
it
was
n't
near
Johnson
Creek
--
when
we
arrived
,
and
I
saw
the
bakery
...
I
knew
I
was
home
.
It
was
near
dinner	FOOD
time
so
I
ordered
stuffed
chicken	FOOD
breast	FOOD
.
The
dinner	FOOD
roll
alone
is
a
meal	FOOD
.
I
ca
n't
say
enough
about
dinner	FOOD
.
Everything
is
homemade
.
They
do
n't
add
alot
of
salt	FOOD
,
if
any
.
You
can
tell
its
fresh
.
Its
plentiful
.
Its
cheap
.
You
literally
can
stuff
yourself
for
next
to
nothing
.
You
ca
n't
possibly
leave
this
place
without
indulging
on
some
bakery
goods
to
take
home
,
IF
they
can
make
it
home
.
In
our
case
,
they
were
safely
packed
in
the
trunk
for
our
safety
and
yours
.
The
last
thing
we
need
to
explain
to
the
police
is
we
were
under
the
influence
of
bakery
goods
from
the
Pine
Cone.Ate
a
Saturday
morning
breakfast	FOOD
at
the
Pine
Cone
.
Friendly
,
quick
service
,
normal
prices
.
But
for
the
new
year
-
the
special
was
all-you-can-eat
pancakes
for
$
2.12
,
I
added
a
breakfast	FOOD

,
sausage	FOOD
links
.
Food	FOOD
was
tasty
,
no
major
qualms
other
than
-
the
hash-browns	FOOD
need
a
bit
more
cooking
and
the
coffee	FOOD
needs
a
bit
more
bite
.
very
nice

-
as
large
as
your

I
took

I
enjoyed

Quick
exit
from

just
northeast
of
MadisonAttention
fans
of
David
Lynch
.
Do
stop
by
this
place
.
The
atmosphere
,
staff
and
patrons
will
certainly
help
to
make
your
visit
enjoyable
.
Last
time
I
was
here
I
ordered
the
caramel	FOOD
nut	FOOD
covered
cinnamon	FOOD
roll
.
The
waitress
asked
if
I
wanted
it
warmed
with
some
butter	FOOD
.
I
thought
that
sounded
even
better
and
said
to
go
ahead
and
do
that
.
She
nodded
agreement
.
Then
when
she
brought
it
to
me
it
was
unheated
and
no
butter	FOOD
.
Odd
but
also
kind
of
humorous
.
I
always
enjoy
being
in
a
David
Lynch
film
from
time
to
time
.
The
service
and
food	FOOD
is
way
better
than
the
country
restaurant
just
a
mile
south
on
51
.
Be
sure
to
go
here
instead
.
Their
booths
are
made
for

people

the
50s

We
used
to
go
to
the
Pine
Cone
when
it
was
across
the
street
.
Must
be
hard
times
for
these
guys
because
the
interior
appears
to
be
older
than
what
they
had
when
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
.
That
place
now
sits
empty	FOOD
.
Why
is
this
area
depressed
?
Do
n't
ask
me
,
I
do
n't
know
.
Do
I
look
like
I
have
all
the
answers
?
The
food	FOOD
here
is
good
and
the
prices
are
cheap
.
Go
here
for
a
nice
meal	FOOD
and
a
flash
back
to
the
past
and
do
n't
forget
to
take
home
some
bakery
.
Or
if
you
are
n't
hungry
just
stop
by
for
some
great
baked
goods
.
Well
worth
the
stop
.
This
place
gets
four
stars
because
of
their
five
star
bakery
selection
.
Crazy
big
cinnamon	FOOD
rolls
and
good
prices.i
rarely
give
five
star
reviews
but
for
what
this
restaurant
is
,
it
's
pretty
perfect
.
i
've
only
eaten
breakfast	FOOD
here
-LRB-
twice
in
the
last
three
weeks
-RRB-
and
the
eggs	FOOD
are
cooked
perfectly
,
the
sourdough	FOOD
toast	FOOD
is
made
in
the
kitchen	FOOD
and
is
delicious
,
and
the
bacon	FOOD
was
perfectly
crispy
.
the
hashbrowns
are
the
best
i
've
had
in
a
long
time
-
perfectly
crispy
on
the
outside
and
fluffy
inside
.
the
pancakes
are
huge
and
light
and
amazing
.
the
cinnamon	FOOD
rolls
taste
just
as
good
as
they
look

right

pretty
great

really
fast

i
have
n't
had
to
wait
more
than
5
minutes
to
get
my
meal	FOOD
.
i
might
be
in
the
honeymoon
phase
,
but
perfectly
cooked
poached
eggs	FOOD
or
over
easy
eggs	FOOD
are
hard
to
come
by
!
it
should
n't
be
an
anomaly
to
discover
well
cooked
food	FOOD
,
but
i
suppose
it
is
.
sure
it
's
a
``
greasy
spoon
''
but
how
many
greasy
spoons
bake	FOOD
their
own
bread	FOOD
?
ca
n't
recommend
this
place
enough
for
great
breakfasts.With	FOOD
a
recent
addition
of
a
truck
driver
for
a
BF
I
have
found
myself
frequenting
truck
stops
to
dine
.
This
little
place
is
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
.
Basically
it
is
just
great
home
cooking
.
Everything
is
homemade
and
quite
good
.
The
baked
goods
in
the
front
counter
were
amazing
.
The
size
of
the
cinnamon	FOOD
rolls
was
insane
.
And
of
course
I
could
n't
leave
without
a
piece
of
pie.This	FOOD
is
one
of
the
best
breakfasts	FOOD
I
have
had
!
Is
the
decor
dated
?
Absolutely
but
it
just
adds
to
the
nostalgic
charm
!
The
place
just
reeks
of
beef	FOOD
cooking
...
Ahhh
delicious
!
Check
out
the
pastry	FOOD
cases

OMG
,
is
all
I
have
to

of
the
best

i
have
had

stopped
in
here
based
on
the
positive
reviews
from
fellow
yelpers
and
was
sure
glad
i
did
.
this
is
a
good
sized
diner	FOOD
at
a
truck
stop

the
first
thing
that
caught
our
eye
was
the
pastries
-
they
were
all
huge
and
all
looked
great

overall
,
great
experience
and
we
were
in
and
out
in
35
mins
so
we
could
continue
out
journey
.
looking
forward
to
stopping
here
again
sometime
soon.This
is
definitely
not
your
usual
truck
stop
.
Pastries
look
delicious
.
Dinner	FOOD
rolls
are
large
enough
for
a
meal	FOOD
themselves
and
good
!
We
had
a
young
waitress
who
I
think
was
new
.
We
found
her
to
be
sweet	FOOD
,
polite
and
trying
very
hard
.
The
lady
managing
the
restaurant
was
really
rude
to
her
.
We
could
all
hear
it.A
delicious
breakfast	FOOD
.
Amazing
fresh
bakery
and
pastry	FOOD
items
.
HOWEVER
,
the
parkinglot/gas	FOOD
station
area
is
filthy
.
Strewn
with
debris
,
dead
cars
,
broken
glass
.
If
you
judge
a
book
by
this
cover
you
would
NEVER
venture
inside
.
I
hope
the
Mgr
.
sees
this
and
cleans
up.Don
'
t
be
fooled
because
it
's
in
a
truck
stop
,
truckers
know
where
there
are
good
places
to
eat
.
Stop
here
just
for
the
desserts
,
I
bought
an
eclair	FOOD
that
must
have
weighed
a
pound
,
delicious
,
like
they
are
supposed
to
be
made
.
Cream	FOOD
Puffs
look
like
they
would
n't
fit
in
a
one
pound

...
grin
.
Do
n't
miss
this
place
...
Continuing
on
my
Saturday
morning
hangover
theme
:
there
's
just
something
about
a
plateful
of
greasy
food	FOOD
when
you
're
slightly
hung	FOOD
over
that
makes
it
all
better
.
The
Pine
Cone
has
down-home
,
rib-sticking
,
greasy
food	FOOD
in
spades
.
The
SO
and
I
split
the
chicken	FOOD
fried
steak	FOOD
,
which
comes
with
plenty
of
toast	FOOD
,
hashbrowns
,
and
two
eggs	FOOD
.
I
could
`
nt
finish
mine
!
The
gravy	FOOD
must
be
the
same
that
they
use
for
biscuits	FOOD
and
gravy	FOOD
,
because
it
tasted
sausage-y	FOOD
,
and
as
my
plate
sat
there
I
could
see
the
grease	FOOD
rising
to
the
top
.
BUT
--
I
did
n't
come
here
in
search
of
health
food	FOOD
,
and
it
was
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
.
I
'll
work
out
later.Some
times
Jane
and
Michael
Stern
are
on
point
and
other
times
the
story
of
the
place
beats
the
food	FOOD
.
I
would
definitely
return
to
the
Pine
Cone
.
It
's
a
bakery
and
diner	FOOD
attached
to
a
truck
stop
on
the
Wisconsin
highway
.
I
live
in
Chicago
and
work
in
a
famous
Mexican
restaurant
and
I
get
up
to
Wisconsin
for
the
old
school
steak	FOOD
and
butter	FOOD
as
much
as
possible
:
it
gives
me
the
energy
to
do
my
job
.
Pine
Cone
has
eclairs	FOOD
and
cream	FOOD
puffs
the
size
of
my
cat	FOOD
.
And
I
got
a
pig
cookie	FOOD
.
This
little
truck
stop
gives
me
the
big
energy
to
get
even
deeper
into
steak	FOOD
and
butter	FOOD
territory.I
like
this
location
better
than
the
one
near
Johnson
's
creek
.
It
is
a
bit
tight
when
you
walk
in
,
but
the
charm
soon
takes
over
.
I
was
not
really
impressed
by
the
food	FOOD
.
However
,
their
pastries
won
my
over
.
Try
it
all
!
The
pie	FOOD
was
delicious
.
I
went
with
a
simple
apple	FOOD
selection
.
Delicious
,
perfection
.
It
is
nothing
crazy
,
no
fancy
name
but
truthfully
one
of
the
best
piece
of
classic
apple	FOOD
you
can
find
around
here
.
The
service
is
a
little
slow
but
once
again
,
it
is
a
small
restaurant
with
lots
of
charm
.
You
get
what
you
get
and
I
love
it
.
It
is
near
a
Christmas	FOOD
tree
farm
so
it
is
the
perfect
place
to
stop
and
get
some
cocoa	FOOD
on
your
way.This
place
was
excellent
.
We
were
a
little
nervous
because
it
is
in
a
truck
stop
but
the
food	FOOD
was
absolutely
delicious
and
the
service
was
fast
and
friendly.OMG
!
The
bakery
items
at
Pinecone
are
AMAZING
!
Cinnamon	FOOD
rolls
as
big
as
your
head
and
absolutely
scrumptious
!
The
food	FOOD
in
the
restaurant
is
great
for
truck
stop
food	FOOD
.
We
've
only
come
for
breakfast	FOOD
but
stop
every
single
time
we
head
up
to
Rhinelander
,
WI
.
Do
NOT
miss
this
place
if
even
only
for
their
baked
goods
!
