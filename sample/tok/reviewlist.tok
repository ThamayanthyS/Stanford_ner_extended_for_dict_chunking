Pretty
good
dinner
with
a
nice
selection
of
food
.
Open
24
hours
and
provide
nice
service
.
I
usually
go
here
after
a
night
of
partying
.
My
favorite
dish
is
the
Fried
Chicken
Eggs
Benedict.Good
truck
stop
dining
at
the
right
price
.
We
love
coming
here
on
the
weekends
when
we
do
n't
feel
like
cooking.If
you
like
lot
lizards
,
you
'll
love
the
Pine
Cone!Enjoyable
experience
for
the
whole
family
.
The
wait
staff
was
courteous
and
friendly
;
the
food
was
reasonably
priced
and
a
good
value
.
A
word
of
advice
--
LEAVE
ROOM
FOR
DESSERT
!
the
deserters
are
great
but
huge
!
Plan
to
bring
some
homeOne
of
my
favorite
truck
stop
diners
with
solid
food
and
friendly
,
quick
service
.
My
god
,
those
desserts
are
huge
!
I
ca
n't
imagine
eating
that
giant
cream
puff
.
All
the
food
we
had
was
delicious
and
I
love
how
they
leave
a
carafe
of
coffee
on
the
table
.
Love
this
place
.
Would
definitely
be
back
if
I
was
in
the
area!Only
went
here
once
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
,
but
they
had
great
pancakes
!
My
only
problem
with
it
at
the
time
was
that
they
allowed
smoking
,
so
I
left
smelling
like
a
cigarette
.
With
the
change
in
law
,
I
'm
sure
the
atmosphere
has
improved!Great
truck
stop
restaurant
.
I
've
had
breakfast
and
dinner
here
and
it
has
always
been
good
.
Huge
portions
and
reasonable
prices
.
The
bakery
I
guess
is
legendary
.
They
have
doughnuts
the
size
of
your
head
!
Eclairs
the
size
of
your
arm
and
Cream
Puffs
that
are
about
10
''
high
.
On
our
most
recent
trip
in
the
area
,
stopped
at
the
gas
station
attached
to
the
restaurant
fo
some
quick
snacks
and
of
course
BAKERY
.
If
you
are
driving
by
and
see
the
sign
for
The
Pine
Cone
Restaurant
-
Take
the
next
off
ramp
and
stop
it.Yeah
,
thats
right
a
five
freakin
star
rating
.
Five
Star
Truck
Stop
Dining
At
Its
Finest
.
Be
prepared
to
eat
.
I
was
first
introduced
to
the
Pine
Cone
at
its
Johnson
Creek
location
years
ago
and
freaked
out
at
the
size
of
the
awesome
,
delicious
desserts
.
Then
on
a
recent
road
trip
someone
mentioned
about
eating
at
the
Pine
Cone
,
I
thought
is
there
really
more
than
one
?
I
looked
out
the
window
to
see
exactly
where
we
were
at
and
it
was
n't
near
Johnson
Creek
--
when
we
arrived
,
and
I
saw
the
bakery
...
I
knew
I
was
home
.
It
was
near
dinner
time
so
I
ordered
stuffed
chicken
breast
.
The
dinner
roll
alone
is
a
meal
.
I
ca
n't
say
enough
about
dinner
.
Everything
is
homemade
.
They
do
n't
add
alot
of
salt
,
if
any
.
You
can
tell
its
fresh
.
Its
plentiful
.
Its
cheap
.
You
literally
can
stuff
yourself
for
next
to
nothing
.
You
ca
n't
possibly
leave
this
place
without
indulging
on
some
bakery
goods
to
take
home
,
IF
they
can
make
it
home
.
In
our
case
,
they
were
safely
packed
in
the
trunk
for
our
safety
and
yours
.
The
last
thing
we
need
to
explain
to
the
police
is
we
were
under
the
influence
of
bakery
goods
from
the
Pine
Cone.Ate
a
Saturday
morning
breakfast
at
the
Pine
Cone
.
Friendly
,
quick
service
,
normal
prices
.
But
for
the
new
year
-
the
special
was
all-you-can-eat
pancakes
for
$
2.12
,
I
added
a
breakfast
sausage
patty
-LRB-
$
3.00
-RRB-
.
Father
had
the
typical
,
two
eggs
,
toast
,
hash-bowns
-LRB-
seem
fresh
cut
-RRB-
,
sausage
links
.
Food
was
tasty
,
no
major
qualms
other
than
-
the
hash-browns
need
a
bit
more
cooking
and
the
coffee
needs
a
bit
more
bite
.
very
nice
assortment
of
bakes
goods
-
massive
-
as
large
as
your
head
cream-puffs
,
eclairs
-
I
took
a
blueberry
muffin
to
go
-
which
I
enjoyed
.
Quick
exit
from
I-94
...
just
northeast
of
MadisonAttention
fans
of
David
Lynch
.
Do
stop
by
this
place
.
The
atmosphere
,
staff
and
patrons
will
certainly
help
to
make
your
visit
enjoyable
.
Last
time
I
was
here
I
ordered
the
caramel
nut
covered
cinnamon
roll
.
The
waitress
asked
if
I
wanted
it
warmed
with
some
butter
.
I
thought
that
sounded
even
better
and
said
to
go
ahead
and
do
that
.
She
nodded
agreement
.
Then
when
she
brought
it
to
me
it
was
unheated
and
no
butter
.
Odd
but
also
kind
of
humorous
.
I
always
enjoy
being
in
a
David
Lynch
film
from
time
to
time
.
The
service
and
food
is
way
better
than
the
country
restaurant
just
a
mile
south
on
51
.
Be
sure
to
go
here
instead
.
Their
booths
are
made
for
skinny
people
from
the
50s
.
take
a
table
.
start
a
conversations
with
the
truck
driver
to
your
left
.
We
used
to
go
to
the
Pine
Cone
when
it
was
across
the
street
.
Must
be
hard
times
for
these
guys
because
the
interior
appears
to
be
older
than
what
they
had
when
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
.
That
place
now
sits
empty
.
Why
is
this
area
depressed
?
Do
n't
ask
me
,
I
do
n't
know
.
Do
I
look
like
I
have
all
the
answers
?
The
food
here
is
good
and
the
prices
are
cheap
.
Go
here
for
a
nice
meal
and
a
flash
back
to
the
past
and
do
n't
forget
to
take
home
some
bakery
.
Or
if
you
are
n't
hungry
just
stop
by
for
some
great
baked
goods
.
Well
worth
the
stop
.
This
place
gets
four
stars
because
of
their
five
star
bakery
selection
.
Crazy
big
cinnamon
rolls
and
good
prices.i
rarely
give
five
star
reviews
but
for
what
this
restaurant
is
,
it
's
pretty
perfect
.
i
've
only
eaten
breakfast
here
-LRB-
twice
in
the
last
three
weeks
-RRB-
and
the
eggs
are
cooked
perfectly
,
the
sourdough
toast
is
made
in
the
kitchen
and
is
delicious
,
and
the
bacon
was
perfectly
crispy
.
the
hashbrowns
are
the
best
i
've
had
in
a
long
time
-
perfectly
crispy
on
the
outside
and
fluffy
inside
.
the
pancakes
are
huge
and
light
and
amazing
.
the
cinnamon
rolls
taste
just
as
good
as
they
look
.
prices
are
right
on
,
baked
goods
are
pretty
great
.
service
is
fast
and
friendly
-
really
fast
.
i
have
n't
had
to
wait
more
than
5
minutes
to
get
my
meal
.
i
might
be
in
the
honeymoon
phase
,
but
perfectly
cooked
poached
eggs
or
over
easy
eggs
are
hard
to
come
by
!
it
should
n't
be
an
anomaly
to
discover
well
cooked
food
,
but
i
suppose
it
is
.
sure
it
's
a
``
greasy
spoon
''
but
how
many
greasy
spoons
bake
their
own
bread
?
ca
n't
recommend
this
place
enough
for
great
breakfasts.With
a
recent
addition
of
a
truck
driver
for
a
BF
I
have
found
myself
frequenting
truck
stops
to
dine
.
This
little
place
is
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
.
Basically
it
is
just
great
home
cooking
.
Everything
is
homemade
and
quite
good
.
The
baked
goods
in
the
front
counter
were
amazing
.
The
size
of
the
cinnamon
rolls
was
insane
.
And
of
course
I
could
n't
leave
without
a
piece
of
pie.This
is
one
of
the
best
breakfasts
I
have
had
!
Is
the
decor
dated
?
Absolutely
but
it
just
adds
to
the
nostalgic
charm
!
The
place
just
reeks
of
beef
cooking
...
Ahhh
delicious
!
Check
out
the
pastry
cases
!!!!
OMG
,
is
all
I
have
to
say!hands
down
one
of
the
best
breakfasts
my
wife
and
i
have
had
.
stopped
in
here
based
on
the
positive
reviews
from
fellow
yelpers
and
was
sure
glad
i
did
.
this
is
a
good
sized
diner
at
a
truck
stop
.
the
first
thing
that
caught
our
eye
was
the
pastries
-
they
were
all
huge
and
all
looked
great
.
tip
-
be
sure
to
save
space
for
at
least
one
.
i
went
with
the
cinnamon
roll
french
toast
and
was
very
pleased
.
very
large
portion
and
great
taste
-
go
witht
the
sausage
patty
over
the
links
.
people
behind
us
had
links
on
their
plate
and
they
didnt
look
too
appetzing
.
the
patty
was
good
.

went
with
a
chicken
friend
steak
,
eggs
,
and
hashbrowns
.
hashbrowns
left
a
bit
to
desire
but
they
get
bonus
points
for
being
real
potatoes
and
fresh
.
overall
,
great
experience
and
we
were
in
and
out
in
35
mins
so
we
could
continue
out
journey
.
looking
forward
to
stopping
here
again
sometime
soon.This
is
definitely
not
your
usual
truck
stop
.
Pastries
look
delicious
.
Dinner
rolls
are
large
enough
for
a
meal
themselves
and
good
!
We
had
a
young
waitress
who
I
think
was
new
.
We
found
her
to
be
sweet
,
polite
and
trying
very
hard
.
The
lady
managing
the
restaurant
was
really
rude
to
her
.
We
could
all
hear
it.A
delicious
breakfast
.
Amazing
fresh
bakery
and
pastry
items
.
HOWEVER
,
the
parkinglot/gas
station
area
is
filthy
.
Strewn
with
debris
,
dead
cars
,
broken
glass
.
If
you
judge
a
book
by
this
cover
you
would
NEVER
venture
inside
.
I
hope
the
Mgr
.
sees
this
and
cleans
up.Don
'
t
be
fooled
because
it
's
in
a
truck
stop
,
truckers
know
where
there
are
good
places
to
eat
.
Stop
here
just
for
the
desserts
,
I
bought
an
eclair
that
must
have
weighed
a
pound
,
delicious
,
like
they
are
supposed
to
be
made
.
Cream
Puffs
look
like
they
would
n't
fit
in
a
one
pound
coffee
can
...
grin
.
Do
n't
miss
this
place
...
Continuing
on
my
Saturday
morning
hangover
theme
:
there
's
just
something
about
a
plateful
of
greasy
food
when
you
're
slightly
hung
over
that
makes
it
all
better
.
The
Pine
Cone
has
down-home
,
rib-sticking
,
greasy
food
in
spades
.
The
SO
and
I
split
the
chicken
fried
steak
,
which
comes
with
plenty
of
toast
,
hashbrowns
,
and
two
eggs
.
I
could
`
nt
finish
mine
!
The
gravy
must
be
the
same
that
they
use
for
biscuits
and
gravy
,
because
it
tasted
sausage-y
,
and
as
my
plate
sat
there
I
could
see
the
grease
rising
to
the
top
.
BUT
--
I
did
n't
come
here
in
search
of
health
food
,
and
it
was
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
.
I
'll
work
out
later.Some
times
Jane
and
Michael
Stern
are
on
point
and
other
times
the
story
of
the
place
beats
the
food
.
I
would
definitely
return
to
the
Pine
Cone
.
It
's
a
bakery
and
diner
attached
to
a
truck
stop
on
the
Wisconsin
highway
.
I
live
in
Chicago
and
work
in
a
famous
Mexican
restaurant
and
I
get
up
to
Wisconsin
for
the
old
school
steak
and
butter
as
much
as
possible
:
it
gives
me
the
energy
to
do
my
job
.
Pine
Cone
has
eclairs
and
cream
puffs
the
size
of
my
cat
.
And
I
got
a
pig
cookie
.
This
little
truck
stop
gives
me
the
big
energy
to
get
even
deeper
into
steak
and
butter
territory.I
like
this
location
better
than
the
one
near
Johnson
's
creek
.
It
is
a
bit
tight
when
you
walk
in
,
but
the
charm
soon
takes
over
.
I
was
not
really
impressed
by
the
food
.
However
,
their
pastries
won
my
over
.
Try
it
all
!
The
pie
was
delicious
.
I
went
with
a
simple
apple
selection
.
Delicious
,
perfection
.
It
is
nothing
crazy
,
no
fancy
name
but
truthfully
one
of
the
best
piece
of
classic
apple
you
can
find
around
here
.
The
service
is
a
little
slow
but
once
again
,
it
is
a
small
restaurant
with
lots
of
charm
.
You
get
what
you
get
and
I
love
it
.
It
is
near
a
Christmas
tree
farm
so
it
is
the
perfect
place
to
stop
and
get
some
cocoa
on
your
way.This
place
was
excellent
.
We
were
a
little
nervous
because
it
is
in
a
truck
stop
but
the
food
was
absolutely
delicious
and
the
service
was
fast
and
friendly.OMG
!
The
bakery
items
at
Pinecone
are
AMAZING
!
Cinnamon
rolls
as
big
as
your
head
and
absolutely
scrumptious
!
The
food
in
the
restaurant
is
great
for
truck
stop
food
.
We
've
only
come
for
breakfast
but
stop
every
single
time
we
head
up
to
Rhinelander
,
WI
.
Do
NOT
miss
this
place
if
even
only
for
their
baked
goods!A
really
lovely
surprise
on
a
rather
horrific
family
road
trip
.
We
were
greeted
at
the
door
,
the
waitress
was
a
peach
,
and
the
nice
man
who
filled
water/helped
out
was
the
sweetest
guy
ever
.
The
food
is
also
great
if
you
're
a
fan
of
the
diner-type
grub
;
my
hot
turkey
sandwich
will
live
on
in
my
dreams
.
You
can
definitely
tell
the
place
has
the
old
time
appeal
of
a
great
family
place
as
all
the
locals
-LRB-
mostly
older
people
-RRB-
know
each
other
and
it
's
clear
it
's
the
happening
place
for
breakfast
with
the
over-60
crowd
-LRB-
but
hey
,
that
says
the
food
has
to
be
pretty
homestyle
and
tasty
to
me
.
-RRB-
If
you
're
headed
down
94
and
need
a
good
lunch
stop
,
make
this
it.Very
nice
and
clean
place
to
have
breakfast
or
lunchI
eat
here
regularily
because
it
is
consistently
good
.
Very
large
menu
which
makes
it
tough
to
choose
but
never
disappointed!Unlimited
hot
coffee
.
I
do
n't
have
any
recollection
of
what
I
ate
...
I
wanted
t
give
it
four
stars
,
but
that
would
be
a
very
generous
review
for
a
meal
I
can
not
recall
.
I
know
it
was
decently
good
,
and
it
's
like
the
only
restaurant
in
Deforest
.
For
that
,
I
give
it
four
stars.Homestyle
cooking
at
its
best
,
dnt
go
to
culvers
,
McDonald
's
or
whatever
trash
is
right
off
the
hwy
,
head
a
bit
further
down
u
will
find
this
gem
,
one
of
the
reasons
I
love
this
place
so
much
?
They
dnt
play
annoying
music
,
scratch
that
,
they
do
n't
play
ANY
music
.
People
working
here
are
super
nice
as
to
be
expected
.
If
I
owned
this
joint
,
I
would
invest
in
a
new
bigger
sign
,
as
I
drove
right
by
this
place
and
almost
missed
it
twice.Nice
simple
homey
diner
.
Very
friendly
staff
,
huge
family
friendly
menu
,
salad
bar
.
If
you
are
on
the
road
this
beats
the
same
old
options.Love
their
breakfast
menu
&
they
have
friendly
waitstaff
.
We
go
there
nearly
every
Friday
for
the
last
4
yrs
.
I
love
that
they
do
n't
play
any
music
.
It
is
quiet
,
conversational
,
and
comfortable.Went
here
for
lunch
with
two
co-workers
,
checked
Yelp
before
we
went
and
the
reviews
were
very
positive
so
we
decided
to
give
it
a
try
.
Yikes
!
How
can
the
reviews
be
4-5
stars
and
the
service
at
best
``
average
''
,
the
food
was
terrible
and
myself
and
my
co-workers
all
agreed
,
this
restaurant
does
n't
rate
two
stars
.
I
had
one
of
the
special
Friday
offerings
,
Smelt
.
It
came
with
a
salad
-LRB-
very
average
but
fresh
-RRB-
,
fries
-LRB-
ordinary
-RRB-
and
the
Smelt
.
After
a
20-25
minute
wait
our
server
came
with
our
orders
.
I
looked
at
my
plate
and
was
shocked
!
There
was
12-15
so-called
Smelt
about
3
''
long
and
deep
fried
.
They
looked
like
little
fat
cigarettes
!
I
bit
into
one
and
it
was
all
batter
,
I
tried
another
and
it
was
the
same
.
I
had
deep
fried
batter
for
lunch
!!
I
have
n't
had
a
meal
this
bad
since
I
got
out
of
the
Navy
!
My
co-workes
meals
were
not
much
better
,
one
had
Chicken
Fried
Steak
and
he
said
it
was
made
out
of
the
box
.
My
other
co-worker
had
the
Cod
and
he
said
it
was
mushy
and
brown
colored
!
YUK
!
I
hate
to
write
such
a
negative
review
but
this
restaurant
earned
``
one
''
star
.
Maybe
they
have
great
breakfast
!
I
hope
they
do
because
their
lunches
are
sub-par
.
There
are
other
restaurants
on
this
street/highway
,
I
'd
give
them
a
try
before
I
stopped
here
.
I
know
my
co-workers
and
I
wo
n't
be
coming
back.Don
'
t
have
time
and/or
cute
outfits
for
Madison
but
want
an
alternative
to
Cracker
Barrel
?
This
is
your
stop
.
I
started
with
the
chicken
dumpling
soup
.
Simply
divine
,
so
much
as
to
seriously
tempt
my
veg
accomplice
.
Cheese
curds
were
another
hit
,
far
superior
to
those
from
the
state
fair
.
Wraps
,
sammys
,
even
the
fried
mushrooms
were
consistent
,
wholesome
,
and
fresh
.
Service
was
on
point
,
our
waitress
Brianna
was
business
pro
.
People
watching
was
a
little
poor
-LRB-
s
-RRB-
,
to
be
expected
in
rural
Midwest
?
I
think
our
impassioned
debate
over
drug
use
might
have
startled
the
crowd
.
Nonetheless
,
not
a
Cracker
Barrel
.
Takes
Amex.Huge
menu
,
fresh
tasty
food
,
reasonable
prices
.
Beats
a
chain
highway
place
for
sure
.
The
chicken
dumpling
soup
alone
is
worth
a
trip
-LRB-
fresh
made
every
day
and
it
caused
my
vegetable-phobic
daughter
to
eat
carrots
and
celery
of
her
own
voltion
!
-RRB-
;
the
steak-cut
French
fries
were
great
and
the
coconut
cream
pie
was
wonderful.Food
was
very
good
.
I
had
the
Reuben
sandwich
.
My
only
suggestion
is
that
the
waitress
should
check
back
more
often
to
see
if
we
need
anything
.
Otherwise
,
I
recommend
it.My
boyfriend
and
I
came
here
to
have
breakfast
after
New
Years
.
We
were
n't
expecting
much
being
not
at
our
best
either
.
The
service
,
as
mentioned
several
times
in
yelp
,
is
really
slow
.
My
drink
was
forgotten
about
and
the
next
time
our
waitress
came
around
she
was
serving
our
meal
about
30-40
minutes
from
taking
our
order
.
The
restaurant
was
probably
half
full
of
people
.
My
boyfriends
meal
was
mediocre
``
at
best
''
as
he
put
it
but
my
meal
was
worse
.
My
bacon
and
egg
omelette
was
burnt
and
the
cheese
was
scarce
.
At
the
end
of
our
meal
,
our
server
still
charged
us
for
the
missing
drink
but
they
were
kind
enough
to
take
it
off
the
bill
,
that
is
while
we
waited
10
minutes
standing
at
the
register
.
I
would
n't
go
back
to
this
restaurant
because
I
think
my
time
is
worth
more
than
they
treated
it
but
could
be
nice
for
those
who
think
differently.Nice
clean
place
with
a
very
friendly
staff
.
Great
homemade
chicken
dumpling
soup
and
a
very
tasty
club
sandwich
.
Decor
is
outdated
,
but
not
sloppy
.
Good
local
place
to
bring
the
family.Californians
are
all
about
the
In-N-Out
,
where
you
can
get
your
burger
animal
style
.
And
the
Midwest
is
all
about
Culver
's
,
where
the
Butter
Burger
is
the
thing
to
order
.
C.
and
I
ate
lunch
here
on
our
way
between
Milwaukee
and
Mosinee
before
going
to
my
folks
for
Christmas
.
I
got
a
cheddar
burger
with
fries
,
and
C.
got
the
two-piece
chicken
dinner
with
mashed
potatoes
and
green
beans
.
That
's
one
of
the
things
I
love
about
Culver
's
.
Yes
,
it
's
a
fast
food
restaurant
.
But
they
also
do
family
restaurant
food
well
.
The
chicken
was
good
and
the
green
beans
really
fresh
,
C.
said
.
Fast
food
you
can
feel
good
about
.
I
also
got
a
frozen
custard
,
their
flavor
of
the
day
:
Swiss
almond
Christmas
or
something
like
that
.
Chocolate
custard
with
slivered
almonds
.
Yummo.I
wanted
ice
cream
so
my
husband
pulled
off
the
highway
at
this
Culver
's
.
We
opted
to
get
the
flavor
of
the
day
-LRB-
cookie
dough
craving
-RRB-
.
I
was
disappointed
to
find
that
it
was
a
chocolate
custard
with
TONS
of
cookie
dough
chunks
because
I
like
custard
and
not
just
the
mix-ins
,
etc.
but
it
was
overall
a
decent
sundae
.
I
'll
just
stick
to
vanilla
next
time!Next
to
Chick-Fil-A
,
Culver
's
is
my
fav
fast
food
chain
.
Rarely
is
a
snowboarding
trip
complete
without
Culver
's
to
top
off
the
day
.
The
butter
burgers
hit
the
spot
-LRB-
though
mine
was
heavy
on
the
red
onions
;
good
thing
those
are
easily
removeable
-RRB-
,
and
the
fried
cheese
curds
are
to
die
for
.
You
do
n't
find
those
floating
around
just
anywhere
.
But
if
there
is
anything
you
MUST
get
,
it
's
a
cup
of
the
frozen
custard
.
Damn
,
that
's
good
stuff.Go-to
meal
:
cheddar
butter
burger
,
fried
cheese
curds
,
and
flavor
of
the
day
custard
.
The
difference
between
a
deluxe
burger
and
cheddar
butter
burger
is
that
in
the
deluxe
,
you
'll
get
American
cheese
.
And
you
have
to
pay
25
cents
extra
to
add
lettuce
,
tomato
,
etc.
to
the
cheddar
butter
burger
.
File
that
away
in
your
memory
bank.Really
good
stuff
!!
The
custard
was
great
!
I
loved
it
and
when
I
am
back
in
the
old
USA
I
can
only
hope
I
will
cross
paths
with
another
culvers
.
You
know
what
the
thing
is
with
culvers
?
You
actually
do
n't
need
that
much
,
it
's
sort
of
like
eating
cake
batter
or
cookie
dough
.
You
can
only
have
so
much
before
you
start
getting
that
sickly
feeling
and
start
stirring
that
plastic
spoon
around
and
staring
down
the
custard
and
wondering
why
you
dont
wan
na
finish
.
Yeah
it
's
custard
and
it
's
heavy
especially
when
you
add
every
kind
of
peanut
butter
chocholate
bar
to
the
mix.Let
me
tell
you
those
first
five
spoonfuls
are
pure
goodness
then
it
goes
downhill
.
Less
is
more
with
this
stuff
let
me
tell
you
!
Next
time
I
am
getting
the
smallest
size
,
and
I
will
be
far
more
pleased
and
not
guilty
I
threw
out
a
mega
size
bucket
.
Hahaha!My
meaty
goodness
...
why
is
n't
Culvers
a
nationwide
chain
?
This
bacon
cheese
burger
is
way
too
good
to
come
out
of
a
fastfood
drive
through
window
.
I
had
a
nice
little
picnic
on
the
tailgate
of
my
pickup
-LRB-
driving
cross
country
...
long
story
-RRB-
.
I
could
not
believe
how
great
this
burger
was
.
The
amazing
part
is
the
onion
rings
might
be
better
than
the
burger
.
If
you
're
passing
through
Wisconsin
,
you
need
to
stop
at
Culvers.Love
it
!!!!!
Love
it
!!!!!!
love
it
!!!!!!!
Who
does
n't
love
Culver
's
!
Everything
was
great
except
for
the
burgers
they
are
greasy
and
very
charred
compared
to
other
stores.I
really
like
both
Chinese
restaurants
in
town
.
This
one
has
outstanding
crab
rangoon
.
Love
the
chicken
with
snow
peas
and
mushrooms
and
General
Tso
Chicken
.
Food
is
always
ready
in
10
minutes
which
is
accurate
.
Good
place
and
they
give
you
free
pop.Above
average
takeout
with
friendly
staff
.
The
sauce
on
the
pan
fried
noodle
is
tasty
.
Dumplings
are
quite
good.We
order
from
Chang
Jiang
often
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.
The
menu
is
huge
,
and
can
accomodate
anyone
's
taste
buds
.
The
service
is
quick
,
usually
ready
in
10
minutes.Grade
:
C
The
food
is
almost
as
good
as
the
prices
.
Decent
service.I
have
never
eaten
at
the
Green
Lantern
,
but
whatever
.
What
I
HAVE
done
is
gone
to
karaoke
there
.
I
am
not
the
kind
of
person
to
enjoy
a
``
hip
''
bar
.
I
do
n't
want
ironic
metal
on
the
jukebox
or
$
8
flirtinis
.
What
I
want
is
totally
unpretentious
karaoke
renditions
of
Unskinny
Bop
from
people
that
still
look
like
they
graduated
high
school
in
1991
,
and
$
2.50
vodka
and
cranberry
juices.I
'm
sure
if
I
drove
far
enough
outside
of
Minneapolis
I
'd
find
a
place
about
as
awesome
as
the
Green
Lantern
.
Instead
of
doing
all
of
that
work
,
I
just
wish
the
Green
Lantern
would
move
into
my
backyard
.
I
HATE
bars
where
I
feel
like
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
work
just
to
try
to
have
a
good
time
.
I
'm
not
dressing
up
or
drinking
a
certain
drink
just
to
feel
like
I
have
a
shot
of
being
accepted
somewhere
,
believe
me
.
The
Green
Lantern
rules
because
it
's
completely
laid
back
and
totally
unpretentious
.
I
've
seen
such
a
wide
variety
of
people
there
and
everyone
is
always
having
a
great
time
.
Besides
,
the
drinks
are
super
strong
and
cheap
-
that
alone
is
good
enough
for
me.The
biggest
plus
is
it
is
on
the
lake
with
a
dock
and
open
for
breakfest
.
That
is
huge
if
your
a
fan
of
a
boating
trip
to
eat
...
I
'll
swing
by
soon
to
actually
eat
there
again
...
it
's
been
3
years
since
we
had
a
boat
.
We
did
find
a
used
boat
...
now
we
may
return
.
I
guess
that
says
a
lot
as
without
the
boat
,
we
do
not
go
,
with
a
boat
,
its
a
6
out
of
5
stars
!!!!
Who
does
not
love
the
Greeny
?
As
some
posts
before
me
it
is
a
place
you
can
go
and
have
a
good
time
no
matter
what
and
just
be
you
.
The
staff
is
awesome
and
the
food
is
decent
.
But
the
Green
lantern
has
something
that
other
places
try
to
imitate
,
atmosphere
.
I
have
seen
bar
after
bar
try
and
create
a
fun
atmosphere
but
they
can
not
.
The
Greeny
has
it
and
I
wish
I
could
get
there
more
than
I
do.The
Green
Lantern
is
the
kind
of
place
that
comes
in
right
above
the
Mendoza
Line
.
What
I
mean
by
this
is
the
quality
of
the
meals
and
the
atmosphere
of
this
supper
club
is
good
enough
to
warrant
return
visits
but
not
to
elicit
rave
reviews
.
I
'm
not
a
supper
club
kind
of
guy
,
so
right
off
the
bat
a
place
like
the
Green
Lantern
is
n't
going
to
be
my
favorite
.
However
there
are
plenty
of
old
school
supper
clubs
that
do
a
nice
enough
job
that
I
've
got
no
qualms
tagging
along
for
dinner
on
a
Friday
night
.
The
Green
Lantern
is
one
of
these
places
,
albeit
just
barely
.
My
friend
,
however
,
absolutely
loves
this
place
.
As
such
I
've
had
cause
to
dine
here
many
times
over
the
years
.
There
are
quite
a
few
pluses
.
The
bartenders
are
quick
and
generally
friendly
,
and
they
've
got
an
adequate
tap
selection
including
Ale
Asylum
offerings
.
I
love
the
location
right
off
the
lake
,
and
two-thirds
of
the
seating
areas
have
great
atmosphere
.
The
service
has
always
been
above
average
and
I
ca
n't
think
of
a
bad
experience
-
this
type
of
consistency
over
the
years
is
very
hard
to
maintain
.
They
've
got
Wiggies
,
which
are
kind
of
like
low-rent
roesti
-
hashbrowns
with
onions
,
peppers
and
American
cheese
.
And
finally
the
Green
Lantern
is
obviously
popular
with
the
denizens
of
McFarland
.
I
do
n't
recall
a
single
trip
out
here
where
the
bar
was
n't
mostly
full
and
the
restaurant
hopping
.
The
negatives
:
first
and
foremost
I
've
always
found
the
menu
to
be
pretty
limited
.
I
'm
not
big
on
fish
fry
,
and
the
Green
Lantern
's
Friday
night
menu
does
n't
have
much
else
aside
from
sandwiches
and
a
grilled
chicken
breast
entree
.
Now
as
I
said
,
I
'm
not
big
on
fish
fry
so
my
opinion
should
be
taken
lightly
,
but
the
times
that
I
have
ordered
the
fish
I
've
been
underwhelmed
.
This
is
probably
just
me
-
my
friend
simply
ca
n't
get
enough
of
the
stuff
.
Prices
are
moderately
high
for
the
perceived
quality
,
though
the
bar
is
quite
reasonable
.
There
's
also
a
bit
of
a
hassle
when
it
comes
to
paying
the
bill
.
While
I
've
never
had
any
concerns
with
service
from
the
waitstaff
,
I
have
stood
around
for
upwards
of
15
minutes
waiting
to
have
the
hostess
swipe
my
card
.
That
is
unacceptable
and
it
's
unfortunately
led
to
smaller
tips
to
otherwise
deserving
waitresses
.
Finally
,
it
always
seems
that
after
waiting
20-30
minutes
for
a
table
on
a
Friday
night
we
always
end
up
either
in
the
basement
or
at
one
of
the
few
poorly
located
tables
upstairs
.
If
it
were
just
up
to
me
I
do
n't
think
I
'd
be
going
to
the
Green
Lantern
all
that
much
.
After
all
,
I
do
n't
live
in
McFarland
and
I
do
n't
really
go
for
supper
club
fish
fries
.
But
so
long
as
I
know
people
that
love
going
here
I
'll
tag
along
and
have
a
decent
enough
time
.
I
think
you
'd
be
hard
pressed
not
to
at
least
be
able
to
do
that
at
the
Green
Lantern.We
ate
there
several
weeks
back
so
the
details
are
a
bit
thin
,
but
I
do
recall
that
the
service
was
good
and
we
enjoyed
the
burger
,
club
sandwich
,
and
ham
and
cheese
our
group
had
.
Its
exactly
what
you
'd
expect
for
a
good
supper
club.Under
ordinary
circumstances
I
'm
not
a
breakfast
person
.
However
,
the
morning
after
Thanksgiving
,
it
was
obviously
time
to
consume
more
food
,
so
off
to
the
Green
Lantern
we
went
.
And
a
good
thing
too
...
I
had
the
best
breakfast
I
have
eaten
in
recent
memory
,
and
left
totally
impressed
-LRB-
and
full
-RRB-
.
Breakfast
foods
are
simple
foods
.
Many
places
take
advantage
of
the
simplicity
by
rushing
things
along
.
You
end
up
with
edible
but
uninspired
eats
.
Though
my
breakfast
arrived
shortly
after
it
was
ordered
,
it
was
cooked
properly
and
with
care
.
My
sunny
side
up
eggs
were
perfectly
done
,
the
whites
well
set
and
the
yolks
warm
but
properly
runny
.
The
four
-LRB-
!
-RRB-
large
slices
of
bacon
were
thick
and
flavorful
.
I
ordered
the
hash-browns
crispy
,
and
that
's
how
they
came
.
Everything
on
the
plate
was
cooked
just
right
and
tasted
super
good
.
I
could
almost
like
eating
breakfast
out
,
if
every
place
served
breakfast
like
this
.
Service
was
fast
and
friendly
.
Coffee
was
the
usual
diner
style
,
weak
and
plentiful
.
The
bar
looked
capable
of
producing
a
solid
bloody
mary
,
but
alas
this
went
untested
.
Prices
were
as
cheap
as
the
day
is
long
.
I
'm
docking
a
star
for
the
corn
beef
hash
--
it
lacked
flavor
and
that
all
important
crunch
.
All
the
same
,
I
still
highly
recommend
the
Lantern
for
your
breakfast
needs.Ate
breakfast
here
today
;
overall
a
really
good
atmosphere
and
some
tasty
items
on
the
menu
.
I
would
recommend
their
Wiggies
,
a
hodgepodge
of
hash
browns
,
cheese
,
green
peppers
,
diced
ham
,
and
mushrooms
.
I
topped
it
off
with
a
mimosa
and
then
my
gf
and
I
strolled
out
onto
their
dock
and
enjoyed
some
lakeside
scene.We
love
The
Green
Lantern
.
The
food
is
wonderful
and
the
price
is
great
.
We
have
never
had
a
long
wait
for
a
table
and
once
we
are
seated
we
are
always
waited
on
right
away
.
All
the
staff
is
very
friendly
and
atmosphere
is
welcoming
.
We
have
taken
several
friends
here
for
dinner
and
always
have
a
great
time.We
love
this
place
!
This
restaurant
has
excellent
food
!
It
has
been
family
owned
for
years
and
that
is
what
makes
the
difference
.
Love
being
regulars
here
!
Friday
night
fish
fries
are
always
good
.
Scallops
are
really
worth
trying
.
Salads
are
always
fresh
.
Chili
is
very
thick
and
meaty
.
This
place
and
staff
are
always
welcoming
even
when
you
arrive
by
boat
!
Highly
recommend
it
.
Be
sure
to
check
out
their
specials
on
their
awesome

I

Cons
:
Scallops

outdated
walleye

was
eh
,
not
enough
flavors
It
's
very
Divey
,
not
impressed
even
when
my
meal
was
free.We
accidentally
found
Green
Lantern
when
another
local
eatery
was
closed
for
Sunday
night
.
We
could
n't
have
been
more
happy
that
the
other
place
was
closed
as
Green
Lantern
had
friendly
service
,
tasty
food
,
and
the
Packers
on
tv
screens
everywhere
you
looked
.
It
's
a
restaurant
and
bar
,
and
the
building
is
n't
modern
,
so
leave
any
judgmental
aesthetic
attitudes
at
home
-LRB-
or
,
in
our
case
,
the
hotel
room
-RRB-
and
go
enjoy

reasonable

and
good

.
Go
with
the
standards
and
you
will
enjoy!This
place
is
like
an
old
up-north
supper
club
.
It
's
dark
and
cozy
with
orange
light
lanterns
hanging
from
the
ceiling
.
The
upper
seating
level
has
a
lovely
view
of
the
lake
.
I
got
the
lobster
omelet
and
it
had
this
wonderful
,
flavorful
tarragon
sauce
over
the
top
.
Big
chunks
of
lobster
made
it
a
memorable
breakfast
.
My
english
muffin
was
perfectly
toasted
and
buttered
.
My
companion
recommends
trying
the
walleye
breakfast
next
time
.
Our
server
was
very
very
very
nice
and
sweet
.
Several
times
she
uttered
``
take
your
time
,
no
hurry
.
''
I
hear
that
's
the
Green
Lantern
's
tag
line
:
loitering
encouraged
.
I
like
to
relax
,
so
this
place
is
perfect
.
If
I
lived
in
the
area
I
'd
go
there
for
drinks.Never
had
a
bad
meal
here
,
breakfast
lunch
or
dinner
.
Prices
are
very
reasonable
and
the
people
are
very
welcoming
.
One
thing
that
needs
improvement
is
the
coffee
.
I
think
they
let
the
hot
water
wink
at
the
grounds

and
it
's
a
great
place
for
fish
fry.FISH
FRY
was
OUT
OF
THIS
WORLD
!
I
read
an
article
in
Madison
magazine
about
how
this
place
had
one
of
the
best
fish
fry
's
in
town
and
decided
to
try
it
out
!
What
a
gem
!
First
,
The
fish
fry
comes
with
salad
and
a
side
.
Super
Nice
.
Secondly
,
they
must
have
the
world
's
best
tartar
sauce
!
I
could
literally
drink
the
stuff
.
Third
,
I
took
five
people
here
who
all
had
the
fish
fry
and
drinks
and
it
only
set
me
back
60
Bucks
!
WOW
!
I
will
be
back!The
man
and
I
are
on
this
thing
now
where
we
are
trying
to
eat
at
a
few
places
famous
for
their
fish
fry
's
thanks
to
an
article
in
Madison
Magazine
.
There
are
a
few
places
in
the
mag
that
I
am
looking
forward
to
trying
but
Green
Lantern
was
the
first
one
that
we
hit
up
.
Driving
up
the
place
looked
kind
of
small
and
beat
up
which
was
not
what
I
was
expecting
and
not
looking
forward
to
.
As
we
got
closer
however
I
realized
how
big
this
place
was
on
the
inside
.
It
's
huge
!
At
least
it
felt
huge
from
where
we
were
sitting
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
it
was
the
article
in
the
magazine
that
attributed
to
how
crazy
busy
this
place
was
or
if
there
was
a
concert
or
what
but
this
place
was
insane
.
I
mean
we
had
to
wait
for
an
hour
for
our
table
.
On
the
plus
side
we
had
to
wait
an
hour
for
our
table
which
meant
an
hour
of
drinking
so
I
ca
n't
really
complain
.
Because
we
had
been
waiting
for
so
long
we
also
had
a
chance
to
look
at
the
menu
so
when
we
finally
sat
down
we
knew
exactly
what
we
wanted
;
the
waitress
loved
this
.
We
started
with
the
calamari
which
I
'm
starting
to
find
out
is
not
one
of
Wisconsin
's
strong
suits
.
I
do
n't
think
I
have
ever
had
good
calamari
here
;
maybe
this
will
be
my
next
food
challenge
`
The
Great
Calamari
Showdown
'
!
Anyway
,
I
had
a
few
pieces
of
that
and
let
the
man
have
the
rest
''
he
actually
really
liked
it
.
I
ordered
the
salad
which
was
huge
,
cheesy
mashed
potato
,
and
3
pieces
of
the
lightly
breaded
cod
.
The
man
order
the
same
but
with
cheesy
hash
browns
.
The
fish
was
pretty
good
.
It
was
juicy
and
fresh
and
not
bad
.
I
thought
it
was
maybe
just
a
little
over
the
top
with
the
seasoning
.
I
think
I
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
the
flavors
were
a
bit
more
subtle
as
opposed
to
all
up
in
my
face
the
way
it
was
.
With
that
said
however
I
though
it
was
alright
.
The
man
on
the
other
hand
was
in
love
.
He
likened
his
enjoyment
of
this
place
to
the
Tornado
Room
.
Pure
blasphemy
.
He
clearly
does
n't
know
anything
about
food
.
All
in
all
I
am
glad
I
tried
this
place
but
I
do
n't
think
I
will
be
making
it
a
regular
haunt.Stopped
in
for
a
dinner
after
getting
a
recommendation
from
a
co
worker
and
we
were
VERY
impressed
!
It
was
fairly
quiet
on
a
Thursday
night
-
no
problem
getting
a
table
.
The
location
is
fabulous
being
right
on
the
lake
with
views
.
The
ambiance
is
very
much
a
north-woods
tavern
restaurant
type
establishment
-
older
decor
,
a
little
kitschy
,
though
it
suits
the
place
,
well
.
Green
Lantern
has
a
reputation
of
being
a
surf-turf
and
they
do
it
well
!
I
had
the
Ahi-tuna
-
it
was
an
incredibly
delicate
piece
of
fish
cooked
perfectly
.
My
wife
had
a
steak
which
was
also
prepared
very
well
.
We
are
DEFINITELY
coming
back
!
The
server
,
while
young
and
a
bit
`
nervous
'
,
did
a
fine
job
and
she
was
very
pleasant
.
She
also
provided
great
suggestions
for
food
pairings
!
Well
done
:-RRB-
Hint
:
Ask
for
a
seat
by
the
window
to
get
a
view
of
the
lake
.

Been

Once
for
breakfast
and
few
times
for

.
Food
has
been
very
good
and
the
service
is
decent

They
do
n't
have
the
best
view
of
the
lake
but
we
'll
still
be
back.Any
place
that
's
located
on
a
lake
for
a
fish
fry
is
alright
with
me
.
.
It
's
packed
on
Friday
which
means
you
get
to
have
a
few
cocktails
while
waiting
for
a
table
,
the

it

last
Friday
to
try
the
famous
fish
fry
.
Arrived
at
5:50
pm
and
was
quoted
a
25-30
minute
wait
,
which
I
found
acceptable
.
We
were
not
called
until
55
minutes
later
,
and
this
only
happened
when
I
brought
my
two
young
sons
and
sat
on
the
floor
conspicuously
in
plain
view
of
the
host
stand
.
At
that
point
we
were
offered
the
``
quick
alternative
''
of
a
table
downstairs
.
Where
was
this
option
earlier
?
Look
,
we
knew
going
out
on
the
first
Friday
of
lent
would
result
in
a
wait
and
we
brought
a
myriad
of
distractions
along
to
kill
time
for
our
4
and
2
year
olds
.
Those
wear
thin
,
however
,
when
the
wait
is
double
what
you
are
initially
told
and
have
subsequently
relayed
to
the
kids
.
Maybe
this
is
all
due
to
an
inexperienced
host
.
Our
server
was
very
attentive
and
the
food
was
good
.
We
tried
the
baked
,
beer-battered
,
and
fried
fish
.
We
also
had
baked
potatoes
and
french
fries
as
well
as
salads
.
Overall
,
this
was
not
the
best
Madison
has
to
offer
.
We
may
return
,
but
would
only
due
so
as
a
just
a
couple
or
as
a
family
if
we
could
arrive
before
the
rush.The
Lantern
does
n't
profess
to
be
anything
more
than
it
is
.
Good
American
,
wisco
supper

.
Prices
are
very
good
,
and
they
know
how
to
cook
a
steak

Bloody

's
are
great
as
they
allow
you
to

Decent

They

Very
good
at

Also

Solid
choice
,
and
nicest
place
on
lake
waubesa.We
went
to
the
Green
Lantern
last
Friday
and
it
was
our
first
visit
there.Several
of
our
friends
had
always
spoken
highly
of
it
so
we
thought
we
would
give
their
Friday
Fish
fry
a
try
.
I
had
made
reservations
for
us
and
when
we
got
to
the
restaurant
they
informed
us
it
would
just
be
a
few
more
minutes
and
that
we
could
take
a
seat
at
the
bar.The
bartender
was
very
nice
and
intuitive
,
he
noticed
I
was
eying
up
the
pickled
mushrooms
and
gave
me
some
for
my
cocktail.A
few
minutes
later
we
were
promptly
seated
so
the
wait
was
not
long
at
all.We
were
seated
at
a
nice
table
by
the
window
with
a
view
of
the
lake.So
far
so
good.We
ordered
a
kalamari
appetizer
to
share
,
three
beer
battered
cod
fish
fry
dinners
and
one
breaded
shrimp
dinner.The
kalamari
came
first
and
it
was
ok
.
Our
drinks
were
finished
so
we
ordered
more.Finally
she
came
with
our
entrees
but
still
no
beer
we
had
ordered
to
go
with
our
meals.So
we
reminded
her
again.My
fish
fry
was
warm
and
the
fish
was
flaky.My
moms
fish
fry
,
however
,
was
cold
and
soggy
and
we
had
ordered
the
same
thing.The
cole
slaw
was
good
and
tasted
fresh
and
the
hash
browns
I
had
ordered
were
good
as
well.My
partners
shrimp
though
was
awful.It
was
greasy
and
mushy
and
tasted
awful.The
French
fries
accompanying
it
were
undercooked
and
looked
anemic
,
some
of
them
had
black
coloring
on
them
like
the
bad
part
of
a
potato
that
has
rotted.Our
server
was
still
no
where
to
be
seen
in
order
to
ask
about
our
drinks
or
inform
her
about
the
cold
fish
,
soggy
shrimp
and
undercooked
fries.Finally
we
asked
another
waitress
if
she
could
find
her.When
we
told
her
we
were
disappointed
in
the
food
,
particularily
the
shrimp
and
undercooked
potatoes
she
asked
why
we
had
n't
told
her
sooner
,
to
which
I
really
wanted
to
respond
that
not
once
did
she
check
in
with
us
to
see
how
our
meal
was.She
did
handle
it
all
professionally
in
the
end
and
apologized
,
even
took
half
off
of
our
bill
so
that
was
nice.However
,
between
one
of
us
having
basically
no
good
entree
at
all
and
this
being
our
first
time
there
it
really
was
a
disappointment.Like
I
said
the
hashbrowns
and
coleslaw
were
good
,
the
bartender
and
hostess
service
was
good
but
we
came
there
for
a
good
fish
fry
and
dinner
service.Next
time
we
are
going
to
Tobys
nearby
instead.They
consistently
serve
quality
food
along
with
good
service.What
could
I
possibly
say
about
the
Beach
House
Restaurant
and
Lounge
?
I
guess
I
could
think
of
a
few
things
.
I
went
there
today
for
the
first
time
and
was
dazzled
by
the
charm
it
flaunted
,
while
still
maintaining
the
gritty
edge
of
a
backwoods
Wisconsin
eatery
.
Let
's
not
get
it
twisted
folks
,
we
're
not
breaking
gastronomic
ground
here
.
What
we
are
breaking
are
your
misconceptions
of
what
a
restaurant
can
be
whose
parking
lot
is
largely
composed
of
Chevy
and
Dodge
trucks
,
and
whose
front
,
snow-covered
,
lawn
is
full
of
snowmobiles
.
Deal
with
it
kids
,
this
is
that
slice
of
Midwest
Americana
you
've
been
looking
for
in
any
number
of
wayside
eateries
in
rural
America
.
Fish
fry
anyone
?
To
begin
,
let
me
explain
that
one
of
the
many
draws
for
the
Beach
House
's
patrons
is
the
fact
that
it
is
still
legal
to
smoke
indoors
in
McFarland
.
I
stepped
inside
and
was
immediately
made
aware
of
this
fact
as
plumes
of
smoke
took
up
residence
in
my
clothes
and
nose
.
Do
not
fear
,
however
,
there
is
a
separate
dining
room
that
is
nonsmoking
.
And
man
was
this
separate
dining
room
packed
-LRB-
Superbowl
Sunday
-RRB-
.
Packed
with
large
women
squeezing
into
convention
center
chairs
.
Packed
with
waitresses
who
wore
skin
tight
white
Jordache
jeans
,
giving
you
a
fleeting
sense
of
their
giving
nature
.
Packed
with
the
eager
anticipation
of
an
entire
day
spent
watching
football
and
football-related
activities
:
drooling
,
eating
,
drinking
,
and
smoking
.
God
bless
America
.
The
AM
dish
to
get
here
is
the
Walleye
and
eggs
breakfast
.
I
would
tend
to
agree
,
although
their
limited
selection
of
omelets
is
made
marginally
more
tasty
by
the
addition
of
broccoli
-LRB-
you
heard
me
punk
-RRB-
.
As
breakfast
wore
on
,
the
dining
room
filled
,
emptied
,
and
filled
again
;
the
waitstaff
eagerly
setting
new
places
,
removing
paper
place
settings
,
calling
people
darlin
'
and
hon
'
-LRB-
always
appreciated
-RRB-
.
So
give
it
to
me
hard
backwoods
Wisconsin
.
Give
me
every
sinew
of
your
being
:
your
ice
fishing
,
snowmobiling
,
smoking
,
bloody
Mary
drinking
,
being
.
Just
be
.
And
give
me
a
friggin
'
huge
piece
of
deep
fried
walleye
to
help
me
digest
the
spectacle
,
with
scrambled
eggs
on
the
side
.
And
do
n't
you
dare
forget
the
tartar
sauce.Service
was
terrible
!
I
will
never
return
!!!
We
waited
in
the
bar
and
were
never
greeted
or
spoken
too
.
People
walked
in
after
us
and
were
seated
.
Not
sure
what
their
structure
is
for
seating
,
but
they
suck
at
it
.
I
will
not
be
back.This
place
is
pretty
dumpy
-
``
Corinthian
leather
''
chairs
,
crappy
tables
...
What
is
worth
going
for
is
the
walleye
and
eggs
served
on
weekends
.
It
is
a
HUGE
portion
of
walleye
,
lighty
fried
,
served
with
eggs
cooked
to
order
,
potatoes
and
toast
.
All
this
for
something
like
$
10
.
Totally
worth
a
side
trip
if
you
are
in
Madison.Amazing
Friday
night
FISH
FRY
!
I
got
out
a
lot
for
fish
fry
's
in
Madison
and
the
surrounding
area
and
this
still
remains
my
favorite
.
I
usually
get
the
Cod
dinner
,
which
is
always
cooked
perfect
,
not
too
soggy
or
too
crispy
,
which
comes
with
a
side
AND
a
soup
or
salad
for
only
$
9.95
.
I
always
recommend
the
Beach
House
when
someone
is
looking
for
a
GREAT
fish
fry
!
:
-RRB-
For
being
surrounded
by
two
lakes
,
Madison
does
n't
do
a
great
job
of
having
places
to
drink
on
the
water
.
Head
down
to
McFarland
and
check
out
the
beach
house
.
It
's
like
a
dive
bar
slash
restaurant
right
on
the
lake
.
Tons
of
windows
.
Not
a
bad
place
.
Ca
n't
comment
on
the
food
.
Drink
specials
were
solid.This
place
has
good
steaks
,
and
fish
fry
.
I
also
like
the
saturday
special
bacon
wrapped
filet
,
with
lobster
tail
,
all
for
24.99
I
think
?
All
the
dinners
come
with
soup
or
salad
,
potato
choic
,
warm
rolls
w
/
butter
.
Walleye
,
cod
,
bluegill
are
all
delecious
.
Good
place
for
a
beer
as
well
.
Great
view
,
and
drink
specials
.
This
is
a
real
Sconnie
place
,
Wisco
to
the
core
.
My
fave
Fish
Fry
spot
for
sure.I
have
not
Yelped
in
quite
a
while
and
to
all
my
fans
-LRB-
all
none
of
you
-RRB-
...
sorry
.
So
I
will
start
on
a
positive
note
...
So
I
have
been
to
the
Beach
House
so
many
times
I
feel
dumb
reviewing
it
but
I
am
so
deal
with
it
and
go
there
.
If
you
are
going
for
drinks
...
do
it
.
The
clientele
is
awesome
and
you
will
always
hear
some
great
stories
.
But
this
review
is
for
the
food
.
ALWAYS
AMAZING
!
We
went
for
breakfast
the
other
day
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
and
it
was
as
good
as
I
remember
.
The
Eggs
Benedict
are
just
delicious
and
something
I
could
eat
every
day
and
they
make
one
hell
of
a
Bloody
Mary
-LRB-
so
I
am
told
by
my
wife
since
I
do
not
like
them
-RRB-
if
your
interest
in
that
.
So
if
you
want
some
good
breakfast
on
the
weekend
and
in
the
McFarland
area
...
Breach
House
it
is!Nasty
&
Dirty
.
Food
is
okay
.
They
do
a
great
steak
.
The
place
is
full
of
regulars
drinking
cheap
beer.We
had
dinner
at
the
Beach
House
on
Friday
on
our
way
up
to
northern
Wisconsin
based
on
reviews
on
Yelp
.
If
you
are
looking
for
good
fish
fry
the
Beach
House
has
it
.
I
had
the
perch
which
was
great
,
my
bf
had
the
walleye
which
i
think
had
an
even
better
flavor
.
The
fish
deserves
5
stars
.
Everything
else
a
3
star
.
I
would
give
3 1/2
stars
if
that
were
an
option
.
Would
definitely
go
back.I
really
wanted
to
like
this
place
but
it
was
n't
what
we
were
looking
for
.
They
have
a
great
spot
on
the
lake
but
it
is
a
pretty
dumpy
little
fish
shanty
.
If
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
,
you
will
love
it
.
There
were
a
bunch
of
locals
there
having
a
good
time
and
if
we
were
there
with
a
group
of
our
friends
it
might
be
ok
for
a
few
beers
.
But
still
way
way
too
crowded
.
Like
sardines
in
a
can
.
There
was
no
one
to
greet
us
so
we
just
took
a
table
by
the
window
.
Then
we
waited
and
waited
.
Then
someone
came
over
and
said
hi
.
Then
we
waited
and
waited
.
I
was
about
to
get
up
and
leave
when
someone
came
over
and
said
,
``
oh
,
you
have
n't
been
waited
on
yet
?
''
So
she
then
tried
to
help
things
along
.
The
menu
was
average
for
sandwiches
but
overpriced
,
we
felt
,
for
entrees
as
we
ordered
the
Ahi
Tuna
and
the
Bluegill
.
The
Tuna
was
very
good
and
perhaps
appropriately
priced
but
the
Bluegill
was
not
proportionately
enough
.
It
was
made
well
enough
and
had
ok
flavor
but
should
have
been
a
few
dollars
less
.
Salad
was
ok
.
At
least
had
a
variety
of
greens
but
still
needed
a
little
more
.
If
I
ever
went
back
it
would
be
for
a
few
beers
and
the
view
,
that
's
it
.
It
's
too
bad
because
we
really
need
some
nice
places
on
the
lake
and
with
all
the
lakes
around
here
there
are
n't
as
many
lakeside
restaurants
as
you
would
expect.This
is
the
quintessential
mom
and
pop
bar
/
restaurant
on
a
lake
.
They
specialize
in
cheap
beer
and
great
food
.
Staff
is
friendly
and
down
home
,
but
you
'd
better
leave
your
big-city
attitude
at
home
.
We
went
for
a
Friday
night
fish
fry
.
I
live
in
Seattle
these
days
and
was
not
about
to
miss
the
opportunity
while
in
town
.
Started
with
a
couple
of
Spotted
Cows
-LRB-
on
tap
!
-RRB-
while
the
rest
drank
Miller
Lite
.
-LRB-
Told
ya
...
-RRB-
There
were
five
adults
plus
a
12-year
old
.
Walleye
was
excellent
,
the
waitress
was
too
.
We
made
reservations
and
the
table
was
ready
well
ahead
of
time
.
Our
one
tactical
error
was
sitting
in
the
bar
for
the
view
.
It
was
LOUD
!
Think
that
the
dining
room
is
much
quieter
.
Notice
that
I
am
not
saying
much
about
the
food
?
Here
's
the
deal
:
-
It
was
Friday
-
It
was
Hot
-
The
beer
was
Cold
-
The
fish
fry
was
exactly
what
you
would
expect
in
a
place
like
this
:
great
walleye
!
`
Nough
said
...
We
live
just
down
from
the
Beach
House
.
We
love
going
there
.
They
are
super
friendly
.
We
usually
do
not
have
to
wait
to
be
seated
.
The
weekend
breakfasts
are
the
best
.
Bloody
Marys
are
outstanding
.
Love
the
crab
cakes
eggs
Benedict
.
Yum
!
Huge
portion
of
walleye
with
your
eggs
which
is
one
of
my
friends
favs
when
they
come
visit
.
It
is
a
great
local
hangout
too
,
beautiful
view
,
easy
parking
for
your
boat
from
lake
waubesa
.
We
recommend
it
always!Now
I
must
state
one
little
thing
about
the
way
I
rate
restaurants
.
My
ratings
are
relative
to
my
expectations
of
the
experience
and
in
no
way
relative
to
other
restaurants
,
-LRB-
it
just
is
n't
fair
to
use
the
same
scale
for
a
place
like
the
Beach
House
as
you
would
for
The
French
Laundry
so
again
,
it
's
all
relative
-RRB-
I
've
only
been
here
for
breakfast
but
the
second
time
I
drove
a
long
damn
way
to
have
breakfast
again
so
that
in
and
of
it
self
should
say
something
.
-LRB-
another
caveat
:
there
are
maybe
six
restaurants
in
McFarland
that
do
n't
have
drive-thrus
-RRB-
I
ordered
the
Walleye
and
eggs
both
times
along
with
a
bloody
mary
-LRB-
got
ta
love
a
beer
back
,
yay
for
Wisconsin
-RRB-
.
Now
I
am
well
aware
of
the
number
of
bones
that
a
whole
Walleye
contains
and
can
not
in
any
way
hold
the
Beach
House
responsible
for
that
.
I
can
say
that
the
breading
was
perfectly
crispy
and
well
seasoned
and
that
the
fish
was
not
at
all
over
cooked
,
nice
and
moist
.
plus
I
think
it
cost
$
10
which
was
awesome
-LRB-
you
ca
n't
get
fish
for
breakfast
at
these
prices
in
Chicago
-RRB-
For
me
the
biggest
highlight
of
breakfast
here
is
what
they
do
to
the
potatoes
-LRB-
their
name
for
them
is
eluding
me
at
the
moment
-RRB-
by
request
they
will
top
your
breakfast
potatoes
with
a
heap
of
meat
,
veggies
and
cheese
,
enough
to
make
it
a
hangover-soaking-up
meal
unto
itself
.
To
sum
it
all
up
:
if
you
find
yourself
looking
for
breakfast
and
a
little
``
hair
o
'
the
dog
''
in
McFarland
Wisconsin
because
``
What
happens
at
the
Beach
House
,
stays
at
the
Beach
House
''
and
we
all
love
that
about
any
restaurant.I
use
to
boat
in
this
area
alot
.
I
always
made
this
place
to
stop
for
breakfast
.
very
good
.
They
are
know
for
there
Walleys
and
eggs
,
Some
people
even
like
a
bloody
mary
or
vodka
and
orange
served
with
them
.
Anything
on
the
menu
is
good
.
Nice
place
on
the
water
.
You
can
come
by
boat
or
car
.
If
you
come
by
boat
a
nice
little
ride
over
to
Madison
area
makes
it
a
fun
day.We
love
the
Beach
House
.
We
come
here
often
.
Food
is
always
good
.
Drinks
are
made
by
some
really
awesome
people
!
Specials
are
always
worth
a
look
.
Weekend
breakfasts
are
very
popular
,
so
come
early
.
Try
the
walleye/eggs
.
Or
the
crab/eggs
benedict
.
Very
very
good
!!
Excellent
dinner
.
Had
a
New
York
Strip
steak
and
Scallops
for
$
22.00
Food
was
very
good
and
the
atmosphere
is
the
classic
divey
Wisconsin
bar
.
The
only
way
it
could
be
better
was
if
they
added
outdoor
service/outdoor
bar
.
We
will
be
back!I
've
been
to
this
place
a
couple
of
times
and
we
've
always
had
good
food
.
Service
was
a
bit
slow
,
but
will
definitely
keep
going
back
.
Love
being
so
close
to
Lake
Waubesa
and
watching
the
sunsets
too.Food
and
service
have
always
been
good
.
The
seafood
dinner
was
done
perfectly.The
Beach
house
is
probably
one
of
our
favorite
breakfast
places
.
The
walleye
and
eggs
are
truly
a
specialty
.
Their
fish
fry
is
also
very
good
and
they
have
a
nice
view
of
lake
Wabesa
.
If
they
expanded
food
and
drinks
outside
,
they
'd
have
a
5
star.I
got
a
Groupon
for
here
for
my
fiancee
and
mine
's
anniversary
,
and
we
finally
were
able
to
get
there
a
month
later
.
The
restaurant
was
super
easy
to
find
and
I
loved
how
it
was
right
on
the
lake
.
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
the
last
few
summers
in
northern
WI
on
a
lake
,
so
it
was
nice
to
be
back
on
a
lake
again
-
brought
back
good
memories
!
We
did
not
make
a
reservation
,
so
it
was
an
hour
wait
for
a
table
when
we
arrived
.
We
hung
out
in
the
slightly
crowded
bar
and
had
a
few
drinks
while
we
were
waiting
.
The
drinks
were
good
and
the
bartenders
were
attentive
,
so
no
complaints
there
!
We
were
seated
at
a
table
that
had
a
great
view
of
the
lake
.
They
had
lots
of
specials
going
on
that
night
-LRB-
Friday
night
fish
!
-RRB-
,
and
we
started
with
pepperjack
cheese
curds
.
Delish
!
They
had
a
really
nice
bite
at
the
end
of
them
from
the
peppers
.
I
got
the
blue
gill/lake
perch
combo
and
my
fiancee
got
the
Caribbean
salmon
.
I
know
blue
gill
is
a
thinner
fish
,
and
while
my
dish
was
good
,
there
was
not
a
lot
of
actual
fish
under
the
batter
.
I
got
a
salad
with
my
fish
with
a
tomato
basil
vinaigrette
,
which
was
surprisingly
good
and
coleslaw
which
was
pretty
standard
.
The
salmon
with
the
Caribbean
dipping
sauce
was
fantastic
,
but
the
veggies
he
got
as
a
side
was
just
some
steamed
broccoli
and
carrots
-
not
very
creative
!
Our
server
was
attentive
all
night
,
even
though
the
restaurant
was
super
busy
all
night
.
By
the
time
we
left
,
I
was
very
full
and
satisfied.Went
here
for
fish
fry
with
one
of
my
friends
and
we
ended
up
sitting
outside
and
watching
the
sunset
.
Our
server
was
very
nice
and
the
food
was
SOOOO
good
!
I
had
the
fried
cod
and
she
had
the
walleye
.
We
were
both
impressed
and
full
after
the
meal
.
My
favorite
part
-
the
price
-
very
affordable
and
you
get
to
pick
your
sides
,
which
were
also
really
good
,
american
fries
and
asparagus
.
I
'd
highly
recommend
and
I
'm
going
back!Stopped
here
while
on
a
Sunday
drive
.
Tried
sitting
outside
and
the
waitress
did
not
make
us
feel
welcomed
.
She
was
rude
and
careless
.
We
walked
inside
to
the
bar
where
the
bartenders
were
a
lot
better
.
Unfortunately
the
same
lady
came
in
and
started
venting
about
her
customers
.
Seems
like
they
have
enough
customers
and
do
not
need
to
be
nice
anymore
.
Too
bad
because
the
beer
was
nice
and
cold
.
Great
views
too.It
was
ok
-
waitress
was
very
good
-
even
with
7:45
Friday
night
reservations
no
tables
were
available
and
had
a
very
long
wait
-
drunk
patron
at
the
bar
swearing
very
loud
with
the
F-bomb
and
other
words
and
slamming
items
on
the
bar
-
first
ordered
the
salmon
special
and
of
course
it
was
already
sold
out
-
two
of
us
then
ordered
the
fish
fry
mine
was
lukewarm
and
the
other
one
was
cold
.
Do
n't
plan
on
going
back.I
took
my
mom
and
grandma
to
the
Beach
House
last
night
for
dinner
thinking
it
would
be
better
than
getting
a
Papa
Murphy
's
pizza
.
There
were
n't
many
patrons
in
the
dining
room
.
Our
waitress
was
very
short
with
us
,
demanding
our
drink
orders
before
taking
any
questions
or
orders
for
our
food
.
I
ordered
scallops
,
and
when
they
came
to
the
table
they
were
overcooked
,
but
also
cold
.
It
took
me
at
least
15
minutes
to
find
the
waitress
to
ask
if
I
could
get
warmer
food
.
She
said
that
she
would
have
the
kitchen
make
up
a
new
meal
,
and
about
15
minutes
later
she
returned
with
my
same
plate
,
with
my
original
fork
and
original
food
.
They
scallops
were
now
warm
,
but
lacked
flavor
,
and
were
even
tougher
than
before
.
The
waitress
did
n't
seem
to
care
about
the
quality
of
the
food
and
seemed
to
be
either
having
a
terrible
night
or
was
on
the
influence
of
something
.
Needless
to
say
,
I
will
not
be
returning
.
On
a
positive
note
,
the
sunset
on
the
lake
is
pretty.Later
in
the
night
,
not
very
crowded
yet
they
insisted
we
sit
crowded
next
to
another
pair
of
people
.
Service
was
slow
,
just
getting
a
drink
was
an
effort
.
Food
was
poorly
prepared
and
over
cooked
,
or
as
in
my
partners
case
cold
.
No
way
coming
back
other
than
drinks
in
the
summer.we
found
this
place
on
a
groupon
deal
and
were
excited
to
try
a
new
place
.
It
was
a
train
wreck
!
The
dining
area
was
not
very
busy
even
tho
it
was
a
Friday
night
fish
fry
.
That
should
have
been
our
first
clue
.
We
ordered
the
steak
and
lobster
,
The
steak
was
very
good
,
but
the
lobster
was
still
raw
.
We
sent
it
back
to
be
re
warmed
,
and
still
returned
undercooked
.
we
decided
to
take
it
``
to
go
''
and
finish
cooking
it
at
home.My
husband
and
I
love
our
bloody
marys
&
this
is
NOT
the
place
to
order
one
.
blah
.
Needless
to
say
,
we
will
not
be
back
,
nor
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
else.I
would
not
have
known
about
this
place
had
it
not
been
for
the
Holiday
Groupon
.
I
redeemed
mine
with
my
bf
over
the
weekend
,
and
the
food
was
delicious
and
cooked
well
-LRB-

Holiday
Groupon
pic
-RRB-
.
The
restaurant
was
packed
on
Saturday
night
;
I
'm
glad
I
called
in
a
reservation
.
Local
town
folk
.
Not
a
huge
place
but
still
cozy
.
The
servers
were
running
around
and
busy
but
made
sure
that
our
table
was
attended
well
.
Ask
for
Dee
Dee
;
she
's
a
trip
!
I
'll
be
back
again
for
more
food
once
the
snow
has
melted
to
try
the
other
items
on
the
menu.Ate
there
last
night
with
a
group
of
friends
.
The
waitstaff
was
friendly
,
but
that
was
pretty
much
the
only
good
thing
of
the
night
.
I
hate
french
onion
soup
that
was
so
salty
,
it
tasted
like
a
salt
lick
.
Plus
,
they
put
so
many
croutons
in
the
soup
,
I
was
only
actually
afforded
about
two
small
spoonfuls
of
soup
before
the
liquid
was
soaked
up
.
I
ordered
the
bluegill
for
my
main
dish
.
Being
an
avid
fisherman
,
I
can
appreciate
some
good
Wisconsin
bluegill
.
This
bluegill
,
however
,
was
not
good
.
It
was
cold
and
tasted
very
old
.
The
fries
that
went
along
with
it
were
also
extremely
salty
.
A
couple
people
in
the
group
said
their
food
was
okay
,
but
definitely
not
worth
a
trip
back
.
I
was
quite
bummed
about
this.It
you
're
basic
bar
food
.
Nothing
more.Great
place
on
the
water
.
Beautiful
views
.
Good
fish
fry
.
Very
reasonable
prices
with
nice
selection
of
fish
and
sides
.
The
staff
are
great!Do
you
like
it
when
your
bowels
want
to
explode
?
Then
this
is
the
place
for
you
.
The
sad
thing
is
,
the
aroma
coming
from
the
restaurant
is
hypnotizing
as
it
drifts
through
the
neighborhood
,
and
the
staff
is
really
nice
,
but
holy
jeebus
,
does
the
pizza
suck
.
Every
time
we
went
there
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
in
the
bathroom
.
Awful.Great
little
bar
,
friendly
bartenders
-LRB-
unlike
the
*
other
*
Spartan
-
ahem
!
-RRB-
and
super
pizza
.
A
little
on
the
smoky
side
,
except
for
a
one-day-per
week
smoke
free
Saturday
,
so
time
your
visits
accordingly
.
Decor
in
the
restaurant
could
use
some
updating
,
but
it
's
a
small-town
family
owned
joint
that
is
what
it
is
...
Spartan
Pizza
is
going
smoke-free
on
March
1
,
2010
,
well
ahead
of
the
ban
.
Way
to
go
,
Spartan
!!!
We
went
there
for
the
first
time
yesterday
,
and
I
would
definitely
recommend
Spartan
Pizza
.
Here
's
why
:
-
the
crust
is
thin
,
crunchy
on
the
bottom
,
chewy
on
top
-
the
sauce
is
sweet
and
savory
-
the
cheese
is
rich
and
delicious
-
the
veggies
were
fresh
and
tasty
We
ordered
the
Canadian
bacon
deluxe
-LRB-
with
onions
,
green
peppers
,
green
&
black
olives
,
and
mushroom
too
I
think
-RRB-
.
The
Canadian
bacon
tasted
like
real
meat
and
is
among
the
best
I
've
had
...
not
at
all
like
that
heavily
processed
stuff
you
usually
get
at
the
store
.
The
CBD
is
naturally
quite
salty
from
the
bacon
and
olives
but
I
like
that
.
We
also
had
the
small
salad
which
was
just
iceberg
lettuce
and
tomatoes
,
but
what
can
you
expect
for
$
2
?
I
'd
bet
the
pizza
salad
is
much
better
.
The
service
was
casual
and
friendly
.
In
regards
to
the
atmosphere
,
we
ate
in
the
parlor
booth
area
which
is
clean
enough
and
family-friendly
but
quite
dated
in
appearance
.
We
left
through
the
adjoining
room
which
is
a
bar
that
has
been
added
on
and
is
much
more
modern
and
was
populated
by
locals
drinking
and
eating
dinner
around
the
bar
.
I
should
also
note
that
the
plates
for
eating
pizza
are
plastic
.
This
is
a
``
no
frills
''
kind
of
place.Good
pizza
-LRB-
not
like
Pizza
Hut
,
more
like
home-made
-RRB-
with
a
great
bar
with
nice
,
friendly
service.Good
enough
for
carry-out
in
McFarland
on
a
cold
winter
's
evening
.
Ready
on
time
,
never
had
a
wrong
order
,
and
they
're
at
least
reasonably
friendly
.
Would
be
better
if
they
delivered
,
but
not
sure
there
's
a
huge
demand
for
it
in
our
tiny
burg
.
They
also
have
a
lunch
buffet
on
weekdays
for
around
$
6
.
Best
Chinese
food
madison
!
I
've
tried
them
all
and
make
the
15
minute
drive
every
week
:
-
-RRB-
Awful
,
awful
,
awful
...
The
worst
of
the
worst
of
the
cookie-cutter
Chinese
restaurants
.
Food
without
flavor
,
a
menu
without
imagination
and
a
staff
of
such
profound
indifference
it
's
hard
to
tell
they
're
even
there.Tried
this
because
it
's
local
.
Terrible
,
bland
Chinese
food
.
Not
much
else
to
say
.
Will
never
return
.
My
wife
wanted
me
to
mention
her
sweet
and
sour
chicken
,
which
was
battered
fried
chicken
pieces
with
a
side
of
sauce
in
a
bowl
.
When
she
asked
where
the
vegetables
were
-LRB-
like
the
picture
-RRB-
,
she
was
told
there
is
a
piece
of
pineapple
in
the
sauce
and
that
is
what
comes
with
it
.
As
promised
,
we
looked
hard
into
the
sauce
and
found
one
very
small
piece
of
pineapple
.
Bon
Appetite.Main

No

it

Freshly

Do

order
from
you

The
staff
is
so
friendly
,
I
'm
thinking
about
proposing
in
the
near
future
,
as
I
hope
to
be
a
part
of
their
family
like
they
've

a
part

mine

I
just
ca

I

up

Their

Do

fair

you
learn

decent

Authentic
good
quality
food
in
an
old
style
Chinese
restaurant
setting
.
Very
satisfied
overall
with
my
first
visit
.
Second
visit
included
my
six
year
old
which
was
not
so
good
,
they
do
n't
even
have
crayons
for
a
child.This
is
a
good
Chinese
place
.
Will
it
take
you
to
a
place
you
've
never
been
?
No
.
But
you
will
leave
satisfied.Food
:
It
's
overall
pretty
good
and
probably
one
of
the
more
reliable
options
for
semi-authentic
Chinese
food
in
the
Madison
area
.
To
this
Asian
,
there
is
definitely
some
catering
to
Western
palates
.
Definitely
a
step
down
if
you
're
used
to
eating
at
,
say
,
Chicago
's
Chinatown
-LRB-
both
old
and
new
sections
-RRB-
,
and
there
's
no
extra
menu
in
Chinese
with
the
more
eclectic
stuff
.
Fresh
seafood
options
very
limited
.
Service
:
Average
.
Food
comes
in
a
reasonable
time
,
though
refiling
the
water
sometimes
is
spotty
.
Value
:
Reasonable
overall
.
Prices
fit
the
portions
.
Most
entrees
$
9-15
range
.
Overall
:
Good
for
when
you
crave
Chinese
,
but
I
'd
still
head
to
Chicago
for
the
more
authentic
stuff.Three
stars
=
A-OK
.
It
was
fine
.
It
was
n't
great
.
This
place
has
been
here
for
about
30
years
.
Before
that
it
was
a
car
wash
.
I
always
think
of
it
as
the
place
that
used
to
be
a
carwash
.
Anyway
.
Went
with
a
group
of
15
.
Mom
was
buying
and
we
got
the
``
Classic
''
banquet
-LRB-
the
cheapest
one
-RRB-
.
It
was
more
food
than
we
could
eat
.
The
food
was
fine
.
Not
awesome
.
The
best
flavor
was
hoisin
sauce
and
,
well
,
that
comes
out
of
a
jar
.
We
got
a
sesame
chicken
that
had
nicely
deepfried
chicken
chunks
in
a
citrus-y
sweet
sauce
.
Some
trout
that
my
sister
insisted
on
and
really
enjoys
-LRB-
not
my
thing
,
but
everyone
else
liked
it
-RRB-
.
Mu-shu
pork
-
it
was
good
.
Delightful
-LRB-
?
-RRB-
beef
,
kinda
bland
,
but
nothing
yucky
in
it
.
Aaaannd
,
oh
yeah
,
crispy
duck
.
Very
crispy
,
as
in
dry
.
Not
so
great
.
The
kids
got
those
finger
trap
toys
with
their
fortune
cookies
.
The
waitress
was
cheerful
,
accomodating
and
informative
.
Extra
help
came
out
when
needed.I
think
some
of
the
best
Chinese
food
in
Madison
.
A
little
pricey
but
a
few
dishes
always
feeds
me
for
at
least
two
additional
meals.Imperial
Garden
has
been
around
a
long
time
and
seems
to
be
a
local
favorite
.
That
struck
me
as
a
very
bad
sign
when
I
came
to
Madison
almost
20
years
ago
,
and
that
continues
to
be
the
case
.
The
food
is
insipid
,
blandly
spiced
to
appeal
to
unadventurous
midwestern
tastes
and
with
a
menu
reminiscent
of
the
Americanized
Chinese
palaces
of
the
1950s
.
I
end
up
there
with
various
groups
on
occasion
,
but
try
to
keep
it
to
no
more
frequent
than
once
every
five
years
-LRB-
more
frequently
in
my
first
years
in
Madison
,
less
so
now
-RRB-
.
It
's
not
that
there
are
vastly
superior
authentic
Chinese
options
-LRB-
although
I
prefer
P.
F.
Chang
's
,
recognizing
its
limitations
-RRB-
,
but
one
does
better
with
other
Asian
options
when
in
Madison
--
particularly
Thai/Laotian
,
but
also
Indian
-LRB-
with
many
new
options
in
recent
years
-RRB-
.
It
's
perhaps
the
closest
you
can
get
to
authetic
Chinese
food
in
a
place
like
Madison
,
particularly
after
China
Palace
closed
.
The
food
is
alright
,
it
's
been
embellished
in
a
way
to
appeal
to
an
American
audience
,
but
at
least
the
some
of
the
menu
choices
are
pretty
real
.
My
real
problem
with
this
place
is
the
service
:
The
menu
was
misinforming
and
did
n't
specify
that
some
steamed
fish
dish
was
a
filet
as
opposed
to
a
whole
fish
.
I
politely
complained
to
the
waitress
about
my
order
not
being
accurate
and
she
informed
her
manager
.
The
manager
only
ended
up
refunding
me
50
%
off
the
item
ordered
and
began
telling
me
how
you
would
n't
refund
someone
a
fancy
steak
in
an
expensive
restaurant
!
In
the
end
,
I
paid
for
my
meal
and
tipped
the
poor
waitress
,
but
I
will
never
visit
this
place
again
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
that
manager
woman
was
giving
me
a
hard
time
because
I
was
a
young
college
student
or
what
,
but
her
management
skills
leave
much
to
be
desired.This
was
,
quite
possibly
,
the
WORST
Chinese
food
-LRB-
if
you
can
call
it
that
-RRB-
that
I
've
ever
eaten
in
my
life
.
We
started
with
the
appetizer
platter
for
two
.
The
calamari
was
so
stringy
that
I
had
to
swallow
it
in
one
bite
because
I
could
n't
separate
it
with
my
teeth
.
The
egg
rolls
were
at
least
crispy
and
well-rolled
,
but
they
had
absolutely
no
seasoning
other
than
a
tad
too
much
salt
.
The
shrimp
were
overcooked
,
the
barbecue
pork
was
dry
,
and
the
hot
dumplings
were
cold
and
under
seasoned
.
Then
came
the
entrees
.
I
ordered
Imperial
Chicken
,
thinking
that
being
the
restaurant
's
namesake
,
it
had
to
be
good
.
I
was
wrong
.
The
breading
was
mushy
,
the
chicken
was
dry
,
and
the
sauce
was
basically
sweet
and
sour
sauce
with
added
hoisan
,
and
several
dried
peppers
that
were
burnt
so
badly
they
added
an
unintentional
,
overdone
smoky
flavor
.
My
boyfriend
ordered
the
Ma-po
Tofu
.
He
loves
spicy
food
,
and
this
was
just
a
little
spicy
,
but
the
spice
overpowered
all
the
other
flavors
in
the
dish
-LRB-
besides
the
scallions
-RRB-
.
The
tofu
was
a
good
texture
,
but
the
unbalanced
sauce
flavors
basically
rendered
it
inedible
.
Apart
from
the
horrendous
food
was
the
tepid
service
.
I
had
to
ask
several
times
for
a
glass
of
water
.
The
waitress
came
by
with
the
water
pitcher
and
had
just
enough
to
fill
my
glass
up
halfway
,
so
she
returned
to
the
kitchen
for
a
refill
and
stopped
by
to
fill
my
boyfriend
's
glass
.
By
this
time
,
I
drank
my
half
glass
of
water
-
and
she
did
n't
even
bother
to
top
mine
off
.
I
tried
to
ask
for
some
,
but
she
walked
away
.
Plus
,
I
thought
it
was
supposed
to
be
an
authentic
Chinese
food
restaurant
-
what
's
with
the
Vivaldi
and
Mozart
soundtrack
?
Skip
this
place
all
together
and
hit
up
the
Asian
grocery
and
gas
station
next
door
.
On
Fridays
,
they
receive
shipments
of
Pork
Bao
in
from
a
bakery
in
Chicago
that
are
to
die
for!Probably
the
best
Chinese
in
Madison
these
days
.
Unfortunately
,
that
is
not
saying
much.Took
four
kids
tonight
and
we
were
all
underwhelmed
.
The
chicken
egg
drop
soup
was
oddly
sweet
.
We
got
a
barbecue
pork
dish
and
some
beef
dish
that
both
had
a
bland
gravy
.
A
huge
platter
of
pot
stickers
that
got
everyone
excited
but
ended
up
being
...
bland
.
Even
the
dipping
sauce
just
tasted
like
soy
sauce
.
The
calamari
was
not
tough
.
I
'll
give
them
that
.
If
this
is
the
best
Chinese
food
around
...
I
'm
sorry.Best
chinese
is
Madison
by
far
,
but
very
expensive
!
You
do
always
get
great
service
though
.
Yum!We
visit
family
in
Madison
at
least
twice
a
year
and
always
make
sure
to
have
dinner
here
.
The
shrimp
sizzling
rice
soup
is
absolutely
to
die
for
,
and
every
entree
I
've
had
has
been
fabulous
.
Hands
down
the
best
Chinese
food
I
have
ever
had.This
place
is
wonderful
.
One
,
Almost
anything
on
the
menu
can
be
made
gluten
free
.
Two
,
They
have
about
7
different
types
of
loose
teas
to
choose
from
.
Three
,
The
food
is
GREAT
!
My
favorite
dishes
are
the
Three
Delicacies
Sizzling
Rice
Soup
and
the
Tofu
Lettuce
Wraps
.
I
am
not
lying
when
I
say
that
I
have
NEVER
had
a
dish
I
did
n't
like
here
.
The
food
is
never
greasy
,
never
oversauced
and
never
overcooked
.
The
seafood
and
veggies
always
have
a
really
fresh
taste
...
I
seriously
have
no
complaints
at
all
.
I
miss
you.Just
an
update
to
say
they
do
n't
even
have
the
#
1
spot
anymore
as
that
goes
pretty
easily
to
Ichiban
on
park
.
Still
,
better
than
most
in
town.We
only
ever
go
for
their
lunch
special
-
so
that
's
what
this
review
is
,
I
have
n't
yet
gone
here
for
dinner
.
The
dishes
are
a
little
hit/miss
for
authenticity
.
The
Imperial
Chicken
is
really
good
-LRB-
not
breaded
like
someone
else
said
,
but
it
's
great
-RRB-
,
the
sweet
and
sour
chicken
is
definitely
a
``
miss
,
''
the
mu
shoo
pork
is
great
,
although
a
tad
greasy
,
the
fried
spring
rolls
are
fantastic
,
the
egg
rolls
are
okay
.
The
service
is
FANTASTIC
and
the
price
is
unbeatable
for
what
you
get
.
We
never
walk
away
from
lunch
hungry
.
I
suggest
getting
there
a
little
early
for
lunch
-LRB-
they
open
at
11am
-RRB-
because
it
can
get
a
little
crowded
.
Also
,
I
love
their
spicy
mustard
-
you
have
to
try
it
!!!
Fool
me
once
,
shame
on
you
.
Fool
me
twice
,
shame
on
me
.
I
went
there
a
second
time
because
I
could
n't
remember
if
I
liked
the
food
or
not
-LRB-
yes
,
it
was
THAT
unremarkable
-RRB-
.
Upon
going
there
the
second
time
,
I
knew
there
would
not
be
a
third
.
Ever
.
I
know
this
is
Madison
,
but
c'mon
,
I
've
had
more
authentic
Chinese
food
at
Panda
Express
.
What
should
have
been
an
immediate
tip-off
was
the
fact
that
there
were
n't
any
chinese
words
on
the
menu
...
and
that
all
the
clientele
was
white
-LRB-
again
,
yes
I
know
this
is
Madison
,
but
this
is
compared
to
other
Chinese
restaurants
like
Fugu
or
Ichiban
-RRB-
.
I
do
n't
actually
remember
the
specific
dishes
I
ordered
-LRB-
I
've
had
fish
,
chicken
,
pork
,
and
beef
there
-RRB-
,
but
it
all
just
tasted
as
if
it
had
been
sitting
in
the
freezer
for
months
.
Dry
and
flavorless
.
The
service
was
also
slow
.
They
refilled
our
glasses
only
once
,
after
we
had
asked
for
the
check
.
I
wo
n't
be
going
back.It
is
not
delicious
,
but
the
service
is
good.Often
rumored
to
have
the
best
Chinese
food
in
the
Madison
area
,
this
restaurant
is
a
major
disappointment
.
My
spicy
tofu
and
vegetables
dish
was
not
in
the
least
spicy
and
the
tofu
was
only
fried
and
would
have
been
better
marinated
.
The
entree
my
dining
companion
ordered
was
also
sub-par
.
The
service
was
very
quick
and
the
food
served
very
quickly
,
maybe
too
much
so
.
Madison
has
great
Southast
Asian
restaurants
,
but
I
definitely
wo
n't
be
eating
more
Chinese
food
anywhere
here.Grilled
potstickers
,
moo
shu
pork
,
cashew
chicken
.
Yum
!!
Yum
!
Party
of
7
,
everyone
ordered
their
own
dish
and
then
shared
with
all
.
Started
with
pot
stickers
and
shrimp
ragoon
.
Grilled
pot
stickers
were
really
good
,
could
have
just
eaten
those
and
been
happy
.
Appetizers
came
with
a
variety
of
dipping
sauces
.
Best
dishes
sampled
were
crispy
orange
beef
,
almond
chicken
and
generals
lamb
.
Lamb
was
way
tender
,
excellent
choice
.
Service
was
prompt
and
friendly
,
great
atmosphere
.
Ended
meal
with
delicious
mango
ice
cream
.
Left
happy
and
very
full!I
live
on
the
east
side
of
Madison
and
I
always
eat
at
the
Imperial
Gardens
near
E.
Washington
and
this
Imperial
was
a
let
down
.
The
restaurant
itself
is
beautiful
and
the
decor
is
lovely
but
the
food
and
staff
was
n't
as
amazing
as
I
hoped
for
.
For
starters
,
the
food
is
so
expensive
compared
to
the
east
side
and
the
plates
are
larger
but
the
portions
are
definitely
not
bigger
.
Our
chicken
sizzling
rice
soup
was
flavor
less
and
completely
watered
down
.
My
friend
loves
oyster
beef
but
what
received
tasted
completely
different
and
it
had
a
weird
sort
of
sour
after
taste
.
I
had
the
pepper
steak
and
I
did
like
how
the
onions
and
peppers
are
more
thinly
sliced
but
my
meat
also
had
a
strange
after
taste
.
The
staff
was
very
kind
but
a
little
annoying
.
It
's
was
great
at
first
to
see
how
attentive
they
were
to
our
needs
but
the
waitress
came
to
us
almost
every
10min
and
made
awkward
small
talk
which
really
bothered
us
.
We
could
then
see
her
staring
at
us
from
across
the
room
waiting
to
start
another
unwanted
conversation
.
Imperial
Garden
Middleton
will
definitely
be
memorable
but
,
for
all
the
wrong
reasons.Decent
food
,
slightly
more
expensive
than
their
competitors
,
and
more
legit
varieties
on
their
menu
.
I
'll
give
credit
to
Imperial
Garden
's
decor
as
it
is
significantly
more
eye-pleasing
than
other
Asian
restaurants
and
the
fact
that
they
have
a
full
bar
.
I
give
kudos
to
this
place
because
they
're
the
only
Chinese
restaurant
in
the
area
that
offers
peking
duck
,
a
true
Chinese
specialty
.
Their
seafood
selection
is
also
pretty
upstanding
and
are
cooked
well
.
I
'm
also
a
fan
of
their
``
banquet
''
specials
,
which
is
for
when
you
go
in
groups
and
they
offer
you
a
selection
of
X
many
dishes
to
share
for
a
set
price
per
person
-LRB-
this
is
available
for
lunch
and
dinner
I
believe
,
though
I
've
never
been
here
for
lunch
-RRB-
.
Aside
from
the
aforementioned
pros
of
Imperial
Garden
,
the
other
dishes
on
their
menu
-LRB-
if
you
order
without
doing
the
``
banquet
''
-RRB-
is
average-tasting
at
best
and
overpriced.Im
rating
this
more
on
being
American
Chinese
then
true
authentic
Chinese
.
That
being
said
it
was
very
nice
inside
.
Not
too
formal
but
definitely
not
a
take-out
joint
.
We
got
a
cup
of
the
Hot
and
Sour
soup
.
Which
is
always
my
favorite
.
To
try
something
different
we
got
the
Seafood
Hot
and
Sour
soup
also
.
Almost
taste
just
like
the
regular
Hot
and
Sour
put
of
course
more
of
a
seafood
flavor
then
pork
.
It
only
comes
in
a
serving
that
serves
2-3
.
Which
is
a
great
value
because
the
3
of
us
easily
got
2
cups
each
out
of
it
.
The
Fragrant
Pork
had
chestnuts
,
green
peppers
,
onions
,
mushrooms
and
carrots
in
a
garlic
tomato
sauce
,
Said
that
it
was
spicy
hot
put
I
only
got
a
tiny
bit
of
kick
.
Put
still
good
being
sweet
and
garlicky
.
The
Three
Delicacies
Sizzling
Rice
dish
caught
me
by
surprise
in
a
good
way
.
Expecting
it
would
come
with
that
same
bland
and
over
salty
white
sauce
.
But
I
could
n't
stop
tasting
the
sauce
.
It
was
like
no
other
white
sauce
I
have
tasted
before
.
The
waitress
poured
the
sauce
for
the
dish
right
in
front
of
you
so
it
was
``
sizzling
''
.
The
rice
was
on
the
bottom
of
the
skillet
plate
so
it
ended
up
getting
crunchy
.
Adding
a
great
texture
to
the
dish
.
The
shrimp
,
scallops
and
chicken
in
the
dish
were
tender
.
Also
in
it
were
pea
pods
,
water
chestnuts
,
carrots
and
mushrooms
.
Even
the
fortune
cookie
at
the
end
was
a
better
grade
cookie
then
take-out
places
.
Service
was
helpful
,
attentive
and
friendly.For
Wisconsin
,
this
is
about
the
best
you
are
going
to
get
for
Chinese
Food
.
Sorry
,
you
live
in
Wisconsin
.
But
the
food
is
very
good
.
Huge
servings
,
enormous
shrimps
,
chicken
that
is
tender
,
fresh
rice
.
Do
n't
complain
Cheeseheads
,
this
is
good
as
it
gets
for
Chinese
in
Wisconsin.Yum
.
Check

Just
to

up

How
do
you
get
voted
best
of
for
31
years
when
what
is
served
is
awful
?
This
is
the
worst
Chinese
food
my
entire
family
has
had
in
years
.
We
all
ordered
different
things
and
none
of
us
could
eat
our
meals
.
That
was
$
50
wasted
.
There
was
no
flavor
,
or
the
flavor
there
was
did
not
match
the
dish
.
How
do
you
mess
up
beef
fried
rice
?
I
can
make
it
with
more
flavor
.
The
Mongolian
beef
had
a
flavor
but
it
was
all
wrong
.
If
you
want
to
waste
money
and
still
be
hungry
,
this
is
the
place
for
you
.
How
do
places
keep
getting
good
reviews
when
they
are
so
bad
.
I
use
to
trust
Yelp
reviews
but
lately
,
I
've
been
fooled
by
the
reviews.I
had
fond
memories
of
dining
at
the
Imperial
Garden
...
back
in
the
1990s
,
when
I
did
n't
really
have
access
to
more
``
exotic
''
and
interesting
foods
.
I
've
been
to
this
location
twice
within
the
past
year
or
so
-
once
for
lunch
with
a
coworker
,
and
once
for
dinner
with
friends
last
night
.
+
Huge
establishment
-
impressively
big
+
Quick
to
be
seated
+
Server
was
friendly

Waters
were
refilled

Decent
selection
of
bottled
beers/drinks
-
Massive
menu
,
but
not
really
...
many
identical
dishes
on
the
menu
,
with
different
protein
options
-
Food/dishes
very
salty
,
but
otherwise
bland
in
flavor
.
No
spice
,
no
interesting

-
Sea
bass

extremely
fishy
;
sea

be
``

''
and
non-fishy

-
Service
became
extremely
slow/absent
after
we
received
our
entrees
.
Took
us
30
+
minutes
to
get
checks
,
pay
,
and
leave
-
entrees
arrived
at
7:15
pm
,
we
left
at
8:15
pm
.
I
'm
glad
the
four
of
us
split
entrees
last
night
...
I
would
've
been
really
disappointed
had
I
ordered
something
for
myself
.
It
's
just
...
not
very
good
.
Guessing
this
place
caters
to
folks
who
want
to
eat
adventurously
without
really
doing
so
.
The
food
is
sub-par
;
this
place
is
resting
on
some
large
laurels
.
I
'd
much
prefer
a
flavorful
Thai
or
Indian
dish
.
Wo
n't
be
back.Best
Chinese
food
in
the
area
.
Great
service
and
calming
atmosphere.What
a
crushing
experience
.
My
son
was
in
town
and
when
he
is
here
we
like
to
visit
and
spoil
ourselves
to
a
splurge
of
a
dinner
outing
.
This
particular
night
was
at
the
end
of
summer
and
there
was
an
amazing
thunderstorm
about
to
occur
.
SO
on
this
stormy
night
we
decided
on
Chinese
and
I
had
recommended
we
drive
to
Middleton
for
what
I
had
heard
to
be
the
best
around
.
Ok
.
.
so
after
a
short
15
min
drive
we
had
a
great
parking
spot
...
ran
inside
and
were
greeted
with
a
warming
beautiful
atmosphere
.
.
very
welcoming
large
foyer
,
nice
bar
area
which
u
walk
thru
to
get
to
your
dining
area
.
After
the
immediate
seating
,
WE
were
greeted
by
a
pleasant
asian
woman
and
ordered
drinks
.
which
turned
out
to
be
just
right
.
Appetizers
were
mediocre
...
nothing
to
remember
...
we
had
the
app
for
two
...
calamari
was
HORRIBLE
btw
I
could
go
into
so
much
detail
but
who
is
gon
na
read
all
that
...
the
following
is
my
reason
for
writing
...
My
forewarning
is
NOT
TO
TRUST
in
ordering
the
Lobster
dish
.
I
wanted
a
decadent
treat
for
myself
and
decided
on
the
-LRB-
market
price
-RRB-
45
$
Lobster
dinner
entree
which
came
with
two
choices
of
preparation
.
Ginger
sauce
or
garlic
butter
i
ordered
the
garlic
but
the
server
said
no
the
other
was
best
.
More
importantly
i
asked
her
how
large
the
lobster
was
and
if
it
was
sold
by
pound
cause
it
was
listed
as
Market
Price
.
She
said
she
would
inquire
before
i
ordered
and
returned
to
our
table
and
said
it
was
2.5
pds
or
larger
.
So
that
made
me
excited
and
i
did
not
hesitate
in
my
ordering
.
I
thought
45
dollars
was
a
great
price
for
a
generous
2.5
pd
lobster
entree
.
What
arrived
on
my
plate
was
a
cut
up
overly
sauced
jigsawed
puzzled
lobster
animation
on
a
platter
which
was
in
no
way
a
2.5
pound
creature
to
begin
with
.
It
was
dismantled
then
pieced
together
to
look
like
a
lobster
shape
.
The
meat
was
still
in
shell
.
-LRB-
and
I
mean
IN
SHELL
-RRB-
.
There
was
hardly
any
meat
to
be
had
.
The
tail
which
should
have
been
the
meatiest
portion
was
cut
in
one
inch
pieces
with
shell
INTACT
and
had
yielded
maybe
2
morsel
of
meat
total
.
I
was
shocked
as
i
struggled
to
manipulate
any
source
of
goodness
from
the
pieces
of
crustacean.There
was
literally
no
lobster
and
what
was
there
was
swimming
in
overpowering
sticky
sauce
.
All
in
all
an
EXTREME
disappointment
.
Not
what
I
was
expecting
in
the
LEAST
!!
As
the
storm
gained
intensity
outdoors
,
my
high
hopes
and
any
thoughts
of
returning
to
this
eatery
were
un-intensified
.
I
will
NEVER
return
.
I
can
not
tolerate
being
misled
by
a
server
We
ended
up
tipping
and
not
making
a
fuss
...
just
another
lesson
learned
.
The
storm
raged
on
,
I
did
get
to
spend
time
with
my
son
and
hopefully
educate
you
.
.
Not
a
total
loss
I
guess.Just
stay
away
from
places
like
this
that
lie
for
profit
and
have
followings
that
end
up
being
ill
fated.Always
consistently
delicious
!
Classic
preparations
of
Americanized
Chinese
.
The
cashew
chicken
is
great!I
was
in
town
visiting
family
and
someone
suggested
IG
.
When
I
drove
up
to
it
,
it
brought
back
yummy
memories
.
It
's
been
years
since
I
ate
there
.
I
am
glad
we
went
there
for
dinner
.
We
ate
governors
chicken
,
governors
beef
,
sweet
and
sour
chicken
,
peppered
beef
and
beef
chow
fun
.
Everyone
ate
their
plates
!
Service
was
slow
that
night
but
the
food
made
up
for
it!There
's
a
climactic
scene
in
the
movie
Drive
where
the
hero
meets
the
badguy
in
a
`
Chinese
'
restaurant
.
It
's
a
prop
for
the
movie
to
sell
the
idea
of
foreign
while
these
two
real
bad
American
dudes
hash
out
their
differences
.
It
's
rich
and
exotic
and
mysterious
and
...
goddamn
exciting
.
IG
is
a
Chinese
American
restaurant
in
the
burbs
of
burbs
that
serves
burbanites
,
but
man
it
had
that
feeling
.
The
Russian
friend
and
I
went
there
on
a
Sunday
night
for
their
Peking
Duck
special
.
We
got
that
and
some
appetizer
platter
and
some
wonton
soup
and
some
cocktails
.
None
of
it
was
particularly
memorable
,
and
in
fact
the
Peking
Duck
skin
was
*
not
*
crispy
,
but
the
presentation
was
spot
on
.
There
's
been
so
much
streamlining
of
Asian
restaurants
that
nice
chairs
and
big
booths
with
lots
of
room
is
uncommon
.
And
on
top
of
it
I
am
a
sucker
for
ethnic
restaurants
that
have
good
servers
that
can
connect
with
customers
.
Do
you
know
how
rare
that
is
?
Take
advantage
and
talk
it
out
.
Be
polite
and
get
good
service
.
I
do
n't
think
Madison
's
foodies
would
give
this
place
four
stars
.
But
I
saw
a
bunch
of
other
slant
eyes
here
with
me
,
and
I
imagined
they
were
like
me
,
wide
eyed
and
happy
to
be
here
eating
whatever
this
was
.
I
'd
take
my
mom
here.Hands
down
the
best
Chinese
food
in
Madison
.
The
chicken
chow
mein
has
been
a
favorite
since
I
was
a
child
.
Try
the
egg
rolls
and
the
jasmine
or
chrysanthemum
tea
.
You
really
can
never
go
wrong
here
!
The
decor
is
beautiful
,
and
makes
you
almost
feel
like
you
could
be
in
a
restaurant
in
China.Imperial
Garden
has
been
getting
progressively
worse
over
the
last
few
years
.
The
waitstaff
has
always
been
attentive
and
professional
,
and
the
wait
time
for
food
is
reasonably
short
.
The
restaurant
itself
and
the
bathrooms
are
clean
and
spacious
.
The
ambiance
is
relaxed
and
pleasant
,
and
noise
levels
are
comfortably
low
.
But
none
of
these
things
can
save
the
mediocre-to-bad
food
.
That
is
,
if
you
get
your
food
at
all
.
On
more
than
one
occasion
,
they
have
forgotten
to
include
entire
entrees
or
side
dishes
when
I
've
picked
up
take-out
.
I
now
double-check
all
of
my
orders
before
leaving
.
The
egg
rolls
taste
like
they
came
out
of
a
box
in
the
freezer
.
They
are
greasy
and
heavy
,
with
very
little
flavor
until
you
douse
them
in
sweet-and-sour
sauce
that
's
so
sweet
it
might
as
well
be
syrup
.
The
same
problems
plague
the
entirely
unremarkable
crab
rangoon
.
I
've
had
the
hot
and
sour
soup
,
and
disliked
the
taste
quite
a
bit
.
Not
spicy
enough
,
and
far
too
sour
.
I
usually
order
the
ginger
beef
stir-fry
.
There
's
hardly
any
ginger
flavor
,
and
the
sauce
is
thick
and
also
fairly
sweet
.
If
they
halved
the
amount
of
sugar
in
everything
,
it
would
be
a
good
start
.
I
've
had
more
success
with
the
sizzling
black
pepper
beef
,
which
has
a
punch
of
black
pepper
and
a
good
balance
of
meat
and
vegetables
.
On
a
recent
trip
,
a
friend
got
the
beef
lo
mein
.
It
had
a
nice
quantity
of
beef
,
but
an
anemic
quantity
of
vegetables
.
It
was
also
very
greasy
and
watery
,
and
tasted
extremely
bland
.
The
only
reason
I
go
here
as
often
as
I
do
is
that
my
grandmother
-LRB-
the
poster
child
for
stereotypical
Wisconsin
taste
buds
,
bless
her
heart
-RRB-
loves
the
three
delicacies
sizzling
rice
.
I
did
discover
one
saving
grace
:
if
you
dump
sriracha
on
the
food
,
it
blends
very
well
with
the
food
and
elevates
all
of
the
flavors
.
Too
bad
they
do
n't
have
any
of
it
at
the
restaurant
,
it
could
save
many
a
dish
.
Bottom
line
:
there
's
much
better
,
more
authentic
,
more
balanced
,
and
less
heavy
Chinese
food
available
in
Madison
at
comparable
prices
.
If
you
're
looking
for
good
Chinese
in
town
,
check
out
Hong
Kong
Cafe
on
Regent
or
Orient
House
on
South
Park
instead.The
short
of
the
story
is
-
we
went
here
yesterday
-LRB-
Mother
's
Day
-RRB-
and
were
there
3
hours
!
Waited
a
full
2
hours
for
our
food
.
So
if
you
have
do
n't
mind
waiting
an
unbelievable
amount
of
time
for
food
and
have
all
day
to
waste
,
then
read
on
...
For
years
I
have
drove
by
the
Imperial
Garden
and
referred
to
it
as
the
``
Chinese
Restaurant
Gas
Station
''
.
I
do
n't
even
know
if
they
are
connected
or
what
,
but
you
see
them
both
as
you
turn
the
corner
.
We
decided
to
go
to
this
place
for
Mother
's
Day
and
check
it
out
.
Talking
to
friends
over
the
weekend
,
we
were
told
it
was
pretty
good
.
The
building
is
nice
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
restaurant
was
way
nicer
than
I
expected
.
Very
large
and
nicely
decorated
.
Not
so
cheesy
like
a
lot
of
Chinese-American
places
in
Wisconsin
.
The
hostess
greeted
us
very
nicely
and
having
reservations
we
were
seated
right
away
.
Now
-
we
were
a
larger
than
average
group
-
table
of
8
-
but
they
clearly
were
set
up
for
groups
this
big
as
they
had
large
tables
in
the
corner
of
the
rooms
with
a
spinning
lazy
susan
in
the
middle
that
was
perfect
for
us
.
I
think
we
probably
could
have
even
gotten
9
or
10
people
on
this
table
.
The
waitress
was
very
nice
too
.
Came
right
away
and
got
us
drinks
and
very
friendly
.
This
is
when
things
went
down
hill
.
We
did
order
appetizers
,
which
came
out
right
away
.
Pot
Stickers
-
both
steamed
and
fried
-
which
were
pretty
good
.
Once
our
whole
group
arrived
we
all
ordered
regular
items
from
their
menu
.
Then
we
waited
.
Waited
and
waited
and
waited
.
Apparently
so
did
everyone
around
us
.
For
hours
-
over
two
to
be
exact
.
The
waitress
did
her
best
-
kept
coming
by
and
telling
us
she
was
sorry
,
that
the
Kitchen
was
crazy
and
that
we
were
next
.
Honestly
we
should
have
left
-
but
it
was
hard
enough
getting
family
members
from
4
households
together
at
one
time
.
Eventually
the
food
came
out
.
To
their
credit
,
I
thought
everything
tasted
pretty
good
.
I
got
two
different
shrimp
dishes
.
Decent
flavor
,
cooked
perfectly
-
the
snap
peas
and
water
chestnuts
were
good
.
Portion
was
decent
on
the
Shrimp
dinner
and
much
larger
on
the
chicken
dinners
that
others
in
my
group
got
.
I
agree
with
other
reviews
-
its
not
the
most
adventurous
food
.
Flavors
were
safe
and
my
spicy
shrimp
was
n't
very
spicy
at
all
.
My
sister-in-law
was
upset
her
Sesame
Chicken
with
Broccoli
came
with
one
piece
of
broccoli
.
She
complained
and
the
waitress
brought
out
a
side
of
broccoli
.
Overall
,
If
the
food
was
n't
pretty
good
-
I
would
have
given
this
place
one
star
.
I
give
our
waitress
credit
for
holding
it
together
too
.
She
offered
free
desert
but
we
were
about
an
hour
late
for
getting
to
another
place
so
had
to
go
.
Saddest
thing
is
we
heard
that
this
has
been
an
ongoing
problem
with
the
Kitchen
.
Sounds
like
they
do
n't
fire
dishes
in
the
order
they
come
in
and
they
have
a
lot
of
trouble
keeping
up
with
things
.
If
they
could
correct
this
problem
and
add
a
bit
more
flavor
into
a
few
dishes
,
the
place
really
could
be
ok
.
Try
it
on
your
own
risk
-
but
I
would
plan
on
spending
several
long
hours
while
you
wait
for
your
food.Absolutely
THE
worst
!
This
place
won
``
Best
of
Madison
''
for
Chinese
food
for
how
many
years
???
The
judge
must
have
been
completely
stoned
out
of
his
mind
!
Customer
service
:
Very
poor
.
The
server
never
checked
back
until
I
went
looking
for
her
,
wondering
where
our
order
was
50
minutes
after
ordering
.
Food
finally
arrived
for
our
group
of
four
--
STONE
COLD
!
Plates
themselves
were
hot
but
practically
frostbite
on
the
food
.
Could
n't
eat
it
.
Manager
came
by
,
apologized
and
took
50
%
off
the
bill
-LRB-
!!!
-RRB-
.
Should
have
been
100
%
comped
.
I
'm
one
of
those
folks
who
normally
overlooks
a
lot
and
actually
hates
to
complain
,
but
this
culinary
travesty
really
needed
to
be
reported
.
If
this
place
previously
had
great
food
and
service
,
then
as
of
2014
they
've
completely
lost
their
``
mojo
''
.
This
is
our
go-to
Chinese
restaurant
in
the
Madison
area
.
Hands
down
,
it
's
the
best
Chinese
I
've
found
so
far
.
I
'd
give
it
5
stars
if
the
prices
were
more
reasonable
and
the
dine-in
environment
was
better
.
Like
I
said
,
the
food
is
superb
.
My
usual
dish
is
Cashew
Chicken
.
It
's
hard
to
deviate
from
that
when
it
's
sooooo
good
.
Other
dishes
are
excellent
as
well
.
What
I
like
about
Imperial
is
that
the
meat
quality
is
good
.
The
beef
is
tasty
and
tender
-
not
tough
or
``
questionable
''
.
The
chicken
is
good
as
well
-
not
some
of
the
gray
chicken-like
material
found
at
lesser
establishments
.
We
do
n't
dine
in
often
or
at
all
.
It
's
a
little
more
formal
than
I
prefer
,
and
the
experience
can
take
a
while
.
Just
not
my
preference
.
I
keep
their
number
in
my
phone
and
call
ahead
for
carry-out
.
That
's
the
way
to
go
here
,
imho
.
Their
location
is
very
convenient
for
those
of
us
that
work
in
town
and
live
in
the
western
`
burbs
.
The
portions
they
give
out
are
very
fair
-
my
cashew
chicken
typically
leaves
me
with
a
nice
lunch
for
work
the
next
day
.
If
you
're
looking
for
top-quality
Chinese
food
,
I
highly
recommend
getting
take-out
here
.
If
you
do
n't
mind
a
more
formal
setting
and
have
the
time
,
go
ahead
and
dine
in.Great
Margaritas
.
But
it
's
hard
to
review
a
mexican
restaurant
that
's
as
good
as
the
next
.
I
still
wish
there
was
a
TRULY
good
mexican
restaurant
in
Madison
...
Still
waiting
.
And
do
n't
come
tell
me
...
um
...
the
one
on
Park
.
.
what
's
that
name
???
...
La
Hacienda
.
I
'd
rather
poke
my
eye
out
or
eat
at
La
Bambas
...
Ok
Mexican
like
everywhere
else
.
I
completely
agree
with
the
previous
reviewer
,
``
when
is
the
authentic
one
coming
to
this
town
?
''
The
menu
cover
page
says
it
's
authentic
,
but
the
men
items
themselves
looked
little
more
tex-mex
ish
.
I
had
a
fajita
plate
while
my
friend
had
a
chicken
dish
-LRB-
I
forgot
what
it
was
called
-RRB-
.
My
fajita
arrived
on
a
sizzling
hot
plate
-LRB-
that
's
takes
care
of
the
``
fun
part
''
regardless
of
the
quality
-RRB-
,
and
it
was
pretty
good
.
The
portion
was
huge
,
so
I
had
to
take
ha
;
f
of
my
plate
to
go
,
and
the
take
out
became
the
perfect
left-over
dinner
next
day.Mi
Cocina
is
my
favorite
Mexican-style
restaurant
in
the
Madison
area
.
I
have
never
come
away
unimpressed
with
either
the
food
or
the
service
.
I
ca
n't
really
speak
to
authenticity
since
I
would
n't
really
know
it
if
I
saw
it
,
but
for
what
they
do
Mi
Cocina
does
it
well
.
All
I
do
know
is
that
I
have
gotten
my
favorites
here
over
and
over
without
ever
having
any
problems
.
The
staff
is
always
friendly
and
fast
which
sets
the
place
apart
from
several
other
area
restaurants
of
the
genre
.
If
only
for
consistency
I
would
rate
Mi
Cocina
a
three
,
and
with
never
having
a
bad
meal
I
definitely
would
go
with
a
high
3.5
-
4
stars
.
Last
time
I
had
the
fried
tilapia
tacos
,
and
I
especially
enjoyed
the
spicy
cream-based
sauce
that
was
served
on
the
side
.
It
was
perfectly
seasoned
for
my
taste
,
though
it
was
a
bit
hot
for
my
mother
.
The
tilapia
was
lightly
fried
and
was
still
tender
.
The
accompanying
refried
beans
were
decent
,
and
served
to
allow
for
the
spice
from
the
tacos
to
dissipate
.
I
still
put
the
blackened
tilapia
tacos
at
Tex
Tubbs
at
the
top
of
my
favorites
list
,
but
these
easily
jumped
to
the
#
2
position
.
On
previous
trips
I
've
gotten
flautas
,
which
were
perfectly
fried
and
not
too
crispy
,
and
the
enchiladas
sonora
,
which
comes
with
an
excellent
spinach
and
a
creamy
sauce
.
I
also
really
enjoy
the
cheese
and
mushroom
quesidilla
and
the
fajitas
.
My
sister
,
who
is
lactose-intolerant
,
had
found
the
menu
a
bit
dairy-laden
,
but
she
did
end
up
finding
a
chicken
breast
entree
that
is
now
her
favorite
.
The
prices
are
quite
reasonable
and
given
the
amount
of
food
always
a
good
deal
.
Mi
Cocina
probably
wo
n't
ever
be
held
up
as
a
paragon
of
the
style
,
but
it
has
always
been
reliable
and
enjoyable
and
for
that
I
'll
keep
coming
back.The
food
is
decent
,
the
service
is
better
than
your
average
Madison
restaurant
and
the
bathrooms
were
clean
.
It
is
a
bit
out
of
our
way
but
it
is
consistent
enough
to
warrant
more
visits.Good
food
-
especially
if
you
're
in
a
hurry
.
The
service
is
excellent
.
If
you
're
in
Brookfield
try
the
Mi
Cocina
on
Bluemound
-
I
believe
owned
by
the
same
people
but
the
food
is
bette.rAfter
a
wonderful
day
spent
sitting
down
at
the
Memorial
Union
,
drinking
beer
and
reading
through
the
Sunday
newspaper
,
hunger
got
the
better
part
of
us
,
and
Mexican
food
sounded
yummy
.
So
,
our
small
group
made
our
way
back
toward
the
Middleton
and
decided
to
take
a
short
walk
over
to
Mi
Cocina
.
We
arrived
at
around
6:00
pm
on
a
Sunday
and
were
promptly
seated
.
The
waiter
brought
us
chips
and
salsa
immediately
,
and
then
took
our
drink
orders
.
Within
a
few
minutes
,
our
sodas
arrived
,
along
with
a
cheese
dip
.
We
quickly
scarfed
down
the
salsa
and
cheese
dip
;
the
salsa
was
initially
mild
but
then
had
a
nice
little
kick
to
it
at
the
end
.
The
chips
were
a
thicker
cut
chip
;
they
were
n't
the
slightest
bit
greasy
.
The
queso
was
excellent
-
nice
and
hearty
,
white
cheese
,
delicious
.
We
ordered
our
entrees
and
within
minutes
our
food
was
available
.
There
was
a
slight
mix-up
with
my
order
-
I
had
requested
chicken
burritos
but
received
beef
.
No
big
deal
;
the
beef
burritos
were
decent
-
some
chunks
of
potato
were
an
interesting
touch
.
My
dining
partner
ordered
a
sampler
plate
,
which
came
with
a
chicken
burrito
,
a
chicken
enchilada
,
and
a
tamale
.
It
was
good
as
well
;
the
chicken
was
far
better
than
the
ground
beef
.
Service
was
beyond
excellent
-
very
fast
,
very
attentive
,
and
as
such
,
we
left
a
nice
tip
.
Only
complaints
?
A
tad
pricey
-
our
meal
was
$
26
without
any
beers/margaritas
,
and
there
were
a
ton
of
kids
in
there
,
which
was
a
bit
distracting
.
All
in
all
a
decent
experience.It
started
out
as
an
excellent
place
to
go
then
they
changed
the
menu
,
then
they
changed
the
menu
again
!
The
food
changed
names
and
the
pricing
increased
but
essentially
it
remained
the
same
.
They
are
now
at
the
point
where
they
are
charging
a
little
much
for
the
food
they
are
serving
.
I
still
go
here
because
of
convenience
and
lightning
fast
service
.
I
noticed
a
new
manager
walking
over
the
servers
shoulders
seemed
to
make
the
staff
feeling
like
they
were
on
pins
and
needles
.
Kids

so
keep
that
in
mind!Kids

I
wo
n't
be
heading
back
.
Go
to
Los
Gemelos
off
of
State
St
instead.I
love
their
taco
loco
.
It
's
a
mouthwatering
fajita/taco
salad
concoction
that
I
a.
ca
n't
get
enough
of
and
b.
ca
n't
finish
.
I
have
tried
a
few
other
dishes
and
nothing
ranks
near
the
crazy
taco
.
Warm
,
thick
chips
and
a
mild
salsa
are
served
bountifully
.
The
chips
are
n't
greasy
and
are
not
heavily
salted
which
makes
me
happy
.
I
like
to
add
my
own
anyway
.
They
have
three
versions
of
guacamole
.
Yesterday
we
tried
the
most
basic
which
was
delicious
and
simple
.
We
also
tried
an
appetizer
with
cheese
and
chorizo
.
It
was
good
,
but
quickly
coagulated
which
resulted
in
an
undip-able
dip
.
MARGARITA
ALERT
-
their
house
margarita
...
not
a
traditional
margarita
.
In
my
opinion
,
it
tasted
like
watered
down
orange
soda
.
And
the
color
is
a
light
peach
color
.
If
you
want
a
classic
,
lime
margarita
I
have
yet
to
find
one
I
love
here
.
I
'm
not
your
typical
margarita
drinker
.
The
aftermath
of
too
much
sweet
margarita
mix
and
I
do
not
get
along
.
I
admit
,
I
'm
kind
of
picky
about
margaritas
,
but
these
,
these
should
have
a
warning
when
ordering.Good
authentic
Mexican
,
a
lot
of
menu
options
,
great
service
,
nice
quite
atmosphere.I
really
enjoyed
my
dinner
here
.
I
had
a
fantastic
fajita
platter
,
which
included
beef
,
chicken
,
shrimp
,
and
the
requisite
peppers
and
onions
,
but
also
whole
scallions
and
tomato
wedges
.
Delicious
!
The
guacamole
was
decent
,
though
a
little
bland
.
And
my
husband
's
mole
sauce
was
just
OK
.
But
I
really
liked
the
spicy
salsa
they
brought
to
the
table
when
I
requested
it
.
The
service
was
pretty
great
;
there
was
a
whole
team
of
servers
that
were
constantly
checking
up
on
us
to
make
sure
we
were
doing
OK
.
Every
time
we
had
a
special
request
-LRB-
see
:
the
spicy
salsa
-RRB-
,
they
were
right
on
top
of
it
.
But
what
I
REALLY
liked
was
the
margaritas
;
our
table
had
a
pitcher
of
blended
strawberry
margaritas
,
and
they
were
absolutely
perfect
.
Blended
just
right
with
no
big
chunks
of
ice
;
perfectly
balanced
strawberry
and
tequila
flavor
.
I
could
have
consumed
that
whole
pitcher
by
myself
without
even
putting
in
too
much
effort
.
Yum!So
,
I
've
enjoyed
Mi
Cocina
before
...
but
I
think
my
tastes
have
matured
.
The
salsa
was
good
,
but
the
sauce
inside
of
my
taco
and
chimichanga
was
a
strange
ketchup/bbq
tasting
mixture
.
Beans
were
ok
,
rice
,
not
so
much
.
I
probably
wo
n't
be
back
.
Sorry
Mi
Cocina.I
joined
a
few
coworkers
for
lunch
here
today
...
I
've
not
been
a
huge
fan
of
Mi
Cocina
,
so
I
hoped
the
new
location
and
fresh
look
would
've
improved
the
experience
.
It
's
still
just
barely
passable
as
Mexican
food
.
Most
entrees
appear
to
be
drowning
in
sauces
,
cheese
,
and
other
gooey/greasy
stuff
.
The
salsas
are
extremely
watery
and
lacking
in
flavor
.
The
guacamole
-LRB-
not
the
tableside-made
-RRB-
is
bland
and
pasty
.
I
ordered
a
pollo
ensalada
-LRB-
chicken
salad
-RRB-
,
which
arrived
as
a
bowl
of
super
watery
iceburg
lettuce
,
a
slab
of
seared
chicken
breast
,
4
small
slices
of
cucumber
,
a
spoonful
of
pico
de
gallo
,
and
a
huge
glob
of
guacamole
-LRB-
which
I
scraped
off
and
set
aside
-RRB-
.
The
salad
was
ok
,
but
as
I
neared
the
end
,
I
literally
had
what
looked
like
a
small
soup
bowl
's
worth
of
water
resting
in
the
bottom
.
My
coworker
's
entrees
were
drenched
in
various
cheese
sauces/red
sauces
;
the
taco
combo
was
blanketed
in
cheese
.
They
loved
it
,
but
my
guts
would
've
been
complaining
for
days
...
So
,
enjoy
the
new
location
and
ambiance
-
just
do
n't
expect
better
food
.
Those
who
've
had
real
Mexican
food
will
not
enjoy
this
place

is
my
favorite
Mexican
restaurant
in
Madison
-
and
I
think
it
is
the
best
one
in
town
.
Here
's
what
I
like
:
The
House
Guacamole
-
Heaven
!
I
always
order
this
,
and
the
last
time
,
we
had
a
table
side
preparation
,
a
clear
demonstration
on
how
fresh
the
food
is
here
-
another
thing
that
I
love
about
this
place
-
the
abundance
of
fresh
food
.
In
all
its
simplicity
,
it
's
perfect
.
The
salsa
-
I
've
disappointed
all
over
Madison
with
other
Mexican
restaurant
's
salsa
,
and
even
for
that
matter
,
all
over
the
Midwest
and
parts
of
California
.
I
've
had
the
best
salsa
here
-
again
very
simple
,
but
very
delicious
-
and
is
n't
that
what
matters
?
Food
should
be
delicious
,
especially
food
at
any
restaurant
.
The
chips
-
so
good
,
so
delicious
.
Yes
,
seems
so
silly
to
rate
the
free
chips
,
but
again
another
sign
that
this
restaurant
cares
about
how
food
tastes
and
only
serves
the
best
of
ingredients
and
food
.
As
mentioned
above
,
the
abundance
of
fresh
ingredients
,
especially
fresh
vegetables
,
in
all
dishes
.
As
for
the
other
entrees
,
I
've
never
been
disappointed
.
Take
your
pick
-
they
're
all
good
.
This
restaurant
has
actually
moved
,
and
is
no
longer
located
on
University
Ave.
They
are
now
on
Allen
Bvld
.
I
think
they
have
settled
in
to
their
new
place
,
and
service
is
back
on
par
.
Bon
Appetit!Sooo
...
Ok
.
I
live
Mexican
food
.
I
grew
up
in
Southern
California
so
my
standards
for
Mexican
food
are
high
.
That
being
said
I
assume
most
places
are
gon
na
be
bad
so
that
if
they
are
good
I
'm
quite
happy
...
And
if
they
are
n't
well
...
That
's
what
I
expected
.
This
place
made
me
happy
and
quite
upset
at
the
same
time
.
I
'll
start
at
the
beginning
.
The
chips
...
Kinda
bad
.
They
were
super
dry
and
weird
.
Super
weird
consistency
and
zero
salt
.
Our
second
basket
was
better
,
but
still
lacking
.
The
salsa
was
ok
...
Not
amazing
but
not
bad
.
Margaritas
were
good
and
seemed
to
be
on
the
strong
side
which
no
one
should
complain
about
...
ever
.
My
burrito
was
actually
alright
.
I
had
the
carnitas
burrito
and
it
was
good
.
It
needed
a
bit
of
spicing
up
so
it
asked
for
hot
sauce
and
another
margarita
when
the
waiter
checked
back
.
He
said
no
problem
.
A
few
min
pass
and
he
brings
my
margarita
and
says
he
'll
be
right
bam
with
the
hot
sauce
.
Ok
...
I
'm
eating
very
slowly
because
I
want
that
hot
sauce
.
It
's
now
been
probably
10
min
since
my
margarita
came
.
I
do
n't
like
eating
slow
...
And
I
finally
say
screw
it
and
finish
eating
.
He
comes
and
takes
my
plate
away
...
And
then
he
brings
me
the
hot
sauce
to
the
table
.
I
mean
really
?
Bottom

Service
:
Booooo!I
hate
myself
for
reviewing
Dominos
,
but
I
have
to
give
props
to
this
location
for
their
awesome
service
and
incredible
speed
.
A
+
+
+
+
service
-
friendly
,
helpful
,
and
enjoyable
.
Definitely
not
what
you
'd
expect
from
a
carryout
chain
pizza
place
.
The
``
all
new
''
pizza
that
the
commercials
boast
about
tastes
exactly
like
the
``
old
''
pizza
to
me
.
Perhaps
there
's
a
bit
more
garlic
flavor
to
the
crust
,
but
otherwise
seems
to
be
the
same
`
ole
Dominos
pie
.
Pricey
,
too
.
A
14
''
Brooklyn
with
3
toppings
and
a
pair
of
chocolate
lava
cakes
was
$
25
.
Ouch
!!!
Same
deal
from
Papa
Johns
would
've
cost
$
15
.
I
usually
eat
Dominos
pizza
about
once
every
2
years
.
Even
with
the
``
all
new
''
pizza
,
I
do
n't
think
I
'll
be
sampling
with
any
more
frequency
.

The

buffet
is
the
best
Chinese
buffet
I
've
ever
been
too
!
I
only
give
it
a
4
instead
of
a
5
because
if
i
find
something
better
-LRB-
very
unlikely
-RRB-
i
wo
n't
be
able
to
rate
it
as
such
.
This
buffet
has
everything
you
could
want
from
Chinese
food
.
It
has
a
delicious
array
of
chicken
's
,
pork
,
and
seafood
.
My
personal
fav
's
are
the
Tso
's
,
peppered
chicken
,
crab
cheese
bake
,
deep
fried
shrimp
,
and
the
baked
salmon
.
Their
crab
Rangoon
,
egg
rolls
,
and
soup
are
fair
.
Finally
their
desert
.
Unlike
most
Chinese
buffets
I
've
been
to
this
one
buckets
of
ice
cream
.
You
serve
yourself
but
you
get
a
decent
assortment
of
Mint
Chocolate
chip
,
strawberry
,
butter
pecan
,
and
birthday
cake
.
If
your
ever
in
the
mood
to
over
indulge
on
food
at
a
really
good
price
.
I
definitely
recommend
going
here.I
typically
hate
and
do
not
recommend
Chinese
buffets
,
but
this
is
totally
the
exception
.
I
have
been
going
to
this
buffet
for
a
few
years
now
,
and
it
is
great
every
time
.
They
do
n't
overstock
the
buffet
,
so
they
keep
the
items
fresh
all
the
time
.
From
the
soups
,
to
apps
to
the
main
dishes
,
is
very
good
food
.
Remember
,
its
Chinese
,
so
stay
away
from
the
sushi
,
its
not
up
to
par
with
the
rest
of
the
buffet
.
Finally
,
there
is
ice
cream
kind
of
hidden
in
the
back
.
Put
a
scoop
or
two
on
top
of
a
hot
doughunt
or
two
and
you
will
finish
in
heaven.I
went
to
this
place
at
7pm
.
And
most
of
the
food
was
cold
or
warm
some
hot
fresh
food
.
That
was
good
but
not
for
10.75
.
The
only
thing
was
great
was
the
ice
cram.Went
there
on
Saturday
night
to
get
some
food
to
go
.
On
of
the
worst
Chinese
Buffets
I
've
seen
.
Half
of
the
trays
were
empty
and
other
half
were
almost
empty
.
Very
little
selection
.
The
worst
pay
is
the
take
out
prices
:
$
10.50
to
get
a
to
go
box
-LRB-
should
be
under
2lb
-RRB-
and
40
cents
for
every
ounce
after
,
WTF
is
that
!!!
So
we
just
went
somewhere
else
that
night
and
did
n't
dine
there
at
all
.
Bottom
line
:
EAT
SOMEWHERE
ELSE.Not
good
,
not
BAD
,
this
place
is
a
fine
choice
if
you
're
looking
for
totally
mediocre
but
plentiful
food
.
That
being
said
,
I
would
not
recommend
the
place
to
friends.this
place
is
great
for
what
it
is
.
i
've
never
been
disappointed
-
even
after
the
lunch
rush
is
over
the
food
is
kept
fresh
and
rotated
.
i
ca
n't
speak
for
dinner
,
but
lunch
is
as
good
as
chinese
buffets
get
in
the
madison/middleton
locale
.
jade
garden
is
good
if
they
are
busy
,
but
they
let
the
food
go
to
pot
when
they
slow
down
a
little.I
live
close
by
and
stop
in
periodically
and
have
not
had
any
issues
with
food
or
service
.
I
have
left
full
and
happy
every
time
.
Hot
food
...
all
the
sushi
you
can
eat
!
Keep
up
the
good
work!This
place
is
average
.
Lots
of
food
.
Speedy
staff
.
It
's
a
casual
buffet
.
Great
for
business
lunchesSome
of
the
food
on
the
buffet
is
quite
good
.
The
Szechwan
pork
and
barbecue
pork
stand
out
in
my
recollection
.
The
fried
rice
is
memorable
for
its
blandness
and
frozen
peas
and
carrots
.
Cabbage
was
apparently
the
only
ingredient
that
they
could
find
to
stuff
their
egg
rolls
with
.
This
gets
lows
ratings
for
staff
and
service
.
We
were
barely
acknowledged
upon
entrance
and
completely
ignored
when
attempting
to
pay
.
One
drink
refill
arrived
at
all
,
and
even
then
it
was
about
7
minutes
later
than
desired
.
The
manager
chatted
quite
loudly
on
his
phone
while
we
and
several
others
tried
to
settle
our
bills
.
He
grunted
in
lieu
of
speaking
and
made
his
best
effort
to
lob
the
receipts
over
the
counter
to
avoid
ever
being
within
6
inches
of
his
customers.Not
sure
why
I
keep
deciding
to
come
back
here
.
Rice
is
rock
hard
and
has
no
flavor
,
along
with
most
of
the
other
food
on
the
half-empty
buffet
trays
.
$
10.50
for
a
plate
of
stale
food
and
a
drink
that
they
forget
to
refill
?
No
thanks.A
completely
unexpected
find
.
While
on
a
trip
to
Madison
we
wandered
into
this
cafe
after
checking
out
the
local
grocery
across
the
street
-LRB-
it
's
an
odd
obsession
of
ours
to
check
out
grocery
stores
when
in
a
new
town
-RRB-
.
When
you
're
starving
and
pop
into
the
first
place
you
see
,
you
hope
for
a
sandwich
with
no
mold
on
the
bread
and
a
halfway
clean
glass
for
your
soda
.
This
was
light
years
beyond
that
.
I
had
the
special
salad
of
the
day
.
It
was
delicious
,
a
mixture
of
greens
with
just
a
sprinkling
of
crunchy
celery
,
and
full
of
huge
chunks
of
the
tastiest
creamy
blue
cheese
I
've
had
in
a
very
long
time
.
My
lunch
companion
had
soup
which
she
declared
to
also
be
delicious
.
Decor
was
a
tad
dark
,
and
since
we
were
there
for
a
late
lunch
we
were
the
only
ones
not
sitting
alone
playing
with
laptops
.
However
,
the
tchotkes
and
lending
library
helped
create
a
friendly
neighborhood
hangout
feel.If
you
need
a
tasty
breakfast
for
cheap
,
saunter
in
here
-LRB-
well
,
the
sauntering
might
cause
some
dirty
looks
--
it
's
pretty
low
key
-RRB-
.
This
place
has
tasty
treats
behind
the
glass
case
,
and
a
variety
of
breakfast
dishes
on
their
menu
.
I
love
the
vast
bread
choices
,
and
the
fact
that
they
serve
Alterra
Coffee
-LRB-
our
fave
-RRB-
.
A
bit
of
interesting
art
to
view
,
and
a
nice
sunny
place
to
sit
outside
,
if
you
choose
.
Yay
for
Sundays.I
had
stopped
in
to
the
Prairie
Cafe
&
Bakery
several
times
since
it
opened
to
buy
scones
for
the
office
,
and
I
had
n't
really
given
it
much
thought
beyond
this
purpose
.
I
really
liked
the
scones
,
but
I
did
n't
like
the
fact
that
they
did
n't
open
until
7
which
usually
made
me
a
bit
late
.
I
did
n't
even
consider
that
they
might
have
more
than
bakery
goods
,
and
every
time
I
had
stopped
the
place
seemed
empty
.
This
was
of
course
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
7:01
AM
and
I
was
the
first
person
through
the
door
.
So
this
weekend
,
based
on
Chris
&
Kelly
's
recommendations
,
I
stopped
in
for
a
nice
leisurely
breakfast
before
heading
into
the
office
.
I
found
out
that
all
this
time
I
was
seriously
overlooking
a
great
place
right
in
my
neighborhood
.
I
was
a
bit
taken
aback
by
the
number
of
people
inside
.
The
place
was
pleasantly
crowded
,
with
the
warm
buzz
of
morning
conversations
and
a
relaxed
atmosphere
.
I
walked
up
and
ordered
the
breakfast
special
-
I
was
used
to
just
picking
out
scones
so
it
took
me
a
minute
to
get
my
bearings
and
find
the
menu
board
.
The
price
was
OK
,
not
under
$
6
but
not
more
than
I
would
have
expected
anywhere
else
.
I
was
given
a
number
and
found
a
nice
table
along
the
bookshelves
.
I
'd
never
really
taken
the
time
to
look
around
the
place
before
,
and
I
was
really
impressed
by
the
decor
.
I
got
a
cup
of
coffee
from
the
self-service
area
,
which
is
a
great
idea
-
I
love
diners
where
your
cup
is
constantly
refilled
but
I
tend
to
keep
drinking
so
long
as
there
's
coffee
in
the
cup
,
leading
to
the
over-caffienated
jitters
.
The
coffee
was
excellent
,
truly
delicious
and
fair
trade
to
boot
.
I
savored
it
while
I
read
a
magazine
and
waited
on
my
breakfast
.
After
a
bit
of
a
wait
the
breakfast
special
came
out
.
The
wait
was
n't
especially
long
considering
the
amount
of
people
there
,
but
I
was
into
my
second
cup
of
coffee
by
the
time
my
food
came
.
It
was
served
on
a
fairly
large
plate
,
so
my
first
impression
was
that
there
was
not
much
to
it
,
but
this
was
a
mistake
.
The
special
,
which
was
basically
a
Denver
scrambler
,
was
completely
satisfying
,
filling
but
not
heavy
.
The
wheat
toast
was
much
better
than
the
average
bread
you
get
with
breakfast
,
quite
possibly
highlight
of
the
food
.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
whole
breakfast
experience
here
.
I
was
n't
planning
on
finding
such
a
great
place
for
breakfast
in
the
Prairie
Cafe
.
Maybe
one
of
these
days
I
'll
get
a
chance
to
try
lunch
here
too.I
have
visited
Prairie
Cafe
several
times
and
love
it
.
The
breakfast/lunch
menu
is
varies
from
great
egg
dishes
to
tasty
sandwiches
and
salads
.
Vegetarians
and
non-vegetarians
alike
will
find
somthing
satisfying
.
Good
selection
of
in-house
,
serve-yourself
coffee
.
I
tried
the
``
Health
Shake
,
''
--
sort
of
a
cross
between
a
shake
and
a
smoothie
.
Very
tasty
and
a
perfect
breakfast
.
Very
comfortable
atmosphere
with
free
wireless
.
Seems
to
attract
a
``
usual
''
crowd
.
Overall
a
very
positive
experience.I
've
been
back
here
several
times
since
my
first
review
,
and
have
been
continually
impressed
with
Prairie
.
The
food
is
always
spot
on
and
the
atmosphere
is
so
comfortable
.
The
cafe
sandwiches
take
one
step
towards
gourmet
--
the
tuna
and
egg
salads
are
made
in-house
with
a
little
twist
from
the
same
old
.
All
are
served
with
a
choice
of
side
;
I
favor
the
black
bean
and
corn
salad
.
Breakfast
is
no
exception
to
Prairie
's
perfection
--
my
scrambled
eggs
with
spinach
and
pesto
were
fresh
and
filling
.
And
it
's
hard
to
go
wrong
with
any
of
the
real
fruit
smoothies
or
coffee
drinks
.
Prairie
is
exactly
the
way
a
cafe
should
be.I
've
only
been
here
two
or
three
times
and
I
agree
that
this
little
cafe
is
a
well
kept
secret
.
The
food
is
good
and
healthy
,
the
fireplace
cozy
,
and
the
original
art
on
the
walls
is
a
nice
touch
.
Great
place
to
meet
a
friend
for
lunch
.
Have
n't
tried
breakfast
or
bakery
but
the
chai
latte
was
warm
and
tasty
.
They
also
have
some
vegetarian
choices
.
About
a
year
ago
we
went
and
the
lobster
bisque
was
really
salty
,
but
I
would
n't
hesitate
to
order
soup
from
them
again
.
I
picked
up
the
fabulous
Arts
Commission
calendar
there
last
year
and
this
year
.
Just
found
out
they
have
free
Wi-Fi
.
Check
their
hours
before
you
go
and
bring
cash
or
check
,
no
cc.I
desperately
needed
some
lunch
and
came
on
this
gem
.
I
had
the
Almond
Chicken
Salad
sandwich
on
a
fresh
7-grain
bagette
with
corn
&
bean
salad
.
The
sandwich
was
amazing
.
I
did
n't
really
care
for
the
salad
,
but
that
did
n't
taint
my
experience.Delicious
food
.
Good
prices
.
They
serve
Alterra
coffee
-
awesome
!
My
only
complaint
is
that
they
do
n't
accept
credit
cards.A
solid
little
place
for
breakfast
and
lunch
-
my
experiences
have
been
good
,
but
not
``
outstanding
''
-
it
's
pretty
difficult
to
have
a
bad
breakfast
-LRB-
although
Perkins
seems
to
have
mastered
the
art
of
the
worst
breakfast
-RRB-
,
so
I
'm
going
with
3-stars
:
A-OK
.
The
place
gets
a
little
busy
on
weekends
;
I
've
been
there
both
during
the
week
and
on
weekends
.
It
's
largely
a
``
self-service
''
type
place
,
which
is
fine
by
me
.
You
place
your
order
at
the
main
counter
,
get
your
own
coffee
and
condiments
,
find
a
table
and
wait
for
the
food
to
arrive
.
When
you
're
done
eating
,
you
clear
your
own
table
,
take
the
dishes
to
the
``
dish
basket
''
and
head
on
your
merry
way
.
The
pancakes
are
n't
anything
spectacular
-
just
your
regular
``
mix
made
''
pancakes
.
They
're
cooked
well
,
with
nice
color
,
and
are
``
plate
size
''
so
one
or
two
should
be
plenty
for
most
folks
.
They
're
not
obscenely
thick
;
in
fact
,
they
're
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
,
come
to
think
of
it
.
Breakfast
sandwich
is
decent
-
an
egg
,
your
choice
of
meat
,
some
cheese
,
and
served
on
a
muffin
.
I
've
also
had
the
Wright
Breakfast
and
today
,
I
had
the
special
,
which
was
two
eggs
,
scrambled
with
tomatoes
,
peppers
,
onion
,
ham
,
cheese
and
a
choice
of
toast
.
Again
-
it
was
good
,
but
not
``
out
of
this
world
great
.
''
They
're
currently
serving
Alterra-brand
coffee
;
another
review
references
Ancora
,
but
it
looks
like
they
've
switched
to
Alterra
.
It
's
good
coffee
,
nonetheless
.
Staff
keeps
largely
to
themselves
,
which
is
nice
-
no
one
bothers
you
throughout
the
meal
.
They
do
n't
take
credit/debit
cards
-
it
's
cash
or
check
only
.
There
's
a
fair
amount
of
seating
indoors
and
a
few
metal
tables
and
chairs
outside
for
when
the
weather
is
nice
.
There
tends
to
be
a
lot
of
families
that
meet
here
on
the
weekends
,
so
if
kids
are
n't
your
thing
,
steer
clear
on
Saturday
and
Sunday
.
I
had
the
joy
of
listening
to
two
screaming
kids
during
my
entire
meal
this
morning
-
the
parents
were
oblivious
...
My
biggest
gripe
?
Price
.
My
breakfast
this
morning
-LRB-
``
special
''
plus
two
pancakes
plus
coffee
-RRB-
cost
$
14.10
.
That
's
a
little
steep
for
standard
breakfast
fare
...
Breakfast
is
served
all-day
long
on
Saturday
and
Sunday
;
during
the
week
it
's
served
until
11am
,
at
which
point
it
's
lunch
only
until
closing
time
-LRB-
around
3pm
,
I
believe
-RRB-
.
I
happened
upon
this
charming
restaurant
and
loved
the
simple
and
warm
feel
of
the
place
.
I
had
visions
of
an
egg
breakfast
but
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
,
so
the
wait
person
suggested
the
quiche
which
did
not
disappoint
.
I
was
on
the
road
so
stopping
at
the
Prairie
Cafe
was
just
the
right
thing
to
do.The
coffee
was
delicious
.
The
food
was
good
.
It
was
n't
the
best
breakfast
I
've
ever
had
but
it
was
solid
.
Cash
only.Marvelous
little
breakfast
spot
.
My
husband
and
I
spent
the
weekend
in
Middleton
and
came
here
twice
because
it
was
so
good
!
Really
enjoyed
the
ambience
,
ordering
at
the
register
and
having
our
food
come
out
to
the
table
.
The
fair-trade
coffee
was
outstanding
,
as
were
the
oatmeal
with
berries
and
breakfast
sandwich
.
I
was
particularly
blown
away
by
the
chocolate
croissant
,
which
I
could
n't
imagine
could
trump
my
favorite
at
Bennison
's
in
Evanston
IL
but
it
was
deliciously
buttery
,
flakey
and
had
the
best
chocolate
filling
I
've
ever
had
in
pain
chocolat
!
My
husband
swore
that
his
mocha
was
the
best
he
's
had
in
his
life
.
Kind
of
makes
us
want
to
move
out
here!Just
got
back
from
having
breakfast
with
the
girls
!
It
rocked
!
Excellent
breakfast
!
Two
of
us
had
the
scramble
special
&
one
had
a
scone
-
to
die
for
!
Great
atmosphere
!
Easy
place
to
meet
family
&
friends
and/or
work
!
I
'll
be
going
back
very
soon
!
:
-RRB-
I
used
to
love
this
place
-
I
came
here
once
every
week
or
two
for
breakfast
and
to
sit
and
write
for
an
hour
or
two
-LRB-
I
'm
a
grad
student
working
on
my
thesis
-RRB-
.
The
food
is
expensive
-LRB-
~
$
12
for
two
eggs
,
toast
,
bacon
,
coffee
-RRB-
and
the
coffee
is
n't
great
,
but
the
atmosphere
is
nice
and
I
did
n't
come
all
that
often
so
it
seemed
like
sort
of
a
luxury
.
The
staff
also
is
n't
particularly
outgoing
,
though
not
downright
rude
...
until
today
.
Today
is
Sunday
,
and
I
arrived
around
8am
.
I
usually
try
to
get
there
kind
of
early
and
leave
before
it
gets
busy
so
I
'm
not
taking
up
a
table
.
I
bought
a
big
breakfast
-LRB-
as
described
above
-RRB-
and
sat
down
to
work
.
Just
over
an
hour
later
,
I
was
approached
by
a
middle-aged
man
whom
I
assume
is
the
owner
or
manager
but
whom
I
've
never
seen
before
.
He
asked
if
I
was
aware
of
their
``
new
policy
''
about
Wi-Fi
on
Sunday
mornings
,
and
how
they
do
n't
want
people
just
hanging
out
using
the
internet
when
it
gets
crowded
.
-LRB-
No
sugar
coating
,
that
's
almost
verbatim
what
he
said
.
-RRB-
For
the
record
,
I
was
n't
actually
using
their
wi-fi
,
I
was
writing
.
Whatever
.
His
point
was
obvious
.
I
stared
at
him
for
a
few
seconds
because
I
could
n't
believe
that
a
proprietor
was
actually
asking
me
,
a
paying
customer
,
to
leave
when
I
had
been
there
only
an
hour
and
in
fact
still
had
toast
on
my
plate
.
He
suggested
it
was
fine
for
now
but
that
when
it
started
to
get
crowded
I
should
get
out
.
I
said
that
if
that
's
how
they
felt
I
would
leave
now
,
and
he
responded
,
``
That
's
exactly
how
we
feel
.
''
I
was
shocked
,
and
still
am
.
I
have
never
,
NEVER
been
treated
so
disrespectfully
in
a
place
of
business
.
And
I
'm
a
regular
,
paying
customer
!!
I
always
leave
a
tip
!
I
still
ca
n't
believe
I
was
treated
this
way
.
I
will
no
longer
recommend
this
place
,
now
that
they
've
shown
their
true
colors
.
If
the
food
was
exceptional
I
might
try
to
swallow
my
pride
,
but
it
's
really
nothing
special
.
There
are
several
other
breakfast/coffee
shops
in
the
area
-LRB-
including
a
Starbucks
across
the
road
-RRB-
and
I
will
be
patronizing
them
instead
from
now
on.My
food
was
surprisingly
good
but
the
tuna
salad
had
some
odd
ingredients
.
Read
my
full
review!Prarie
Cafe
&
Bakery
exists
in
one
of
those
cafe/restaurant
purgatories
in
which
nothing
is
offensive
and
nothing
is
remarkable.The
food
is
good
but
there
are
better
brunch
places
in
Madison
.
It
has
a
cozy
feel
but
I
ca
n't
tell
if
they
want
to
be
a
cafe/coffee
shop
or
a
restaurant
.
Cash
Only
!
I
'm
not
running
back
but
will
probably
return
at
some
point.I
must
say
I
rather
like
this
place
,
even
though
I
wish
they
took
credit
cards
.
Great
pastries
and
tea
,
as
well
as
good
veggie
breakfast
options
.
Not
the
fastest
service
but
worth
the
wait.I
'm
soo
confused
.
Am
I
in
a
post
office
,
sit
down
restaurant
,
or
casual
coffee
shop
?
If
you
were
going
for
the
blend
of
all
three
,
then
heck
,
I
guess
you
nailed
it
.
Seriously
.
There
are
postal
boxes
in
this
joint
.
The
best
things
I
can
say
about
this
was
that
the
coffee
was
hot
.
The
breakfast
burrito
I
had
was
``
meh
''
.
Nothing
great
,
nothing
terrible
.
It
was
warm
but
took
fooooooooorrrr-eeeeeeev-errrrrrrrrrr
.
It
was
just
okay
.
They
do
n't
accept
plastic
.
I
can
understand
your
local
dive
bar
or
small
coffee
shop
not
wanting
to
accept
plastic
,
but
for
what
-LRB-
I
think
-RRB-
they
are
trying
to
do
here
,
I
would
expect
them
to
accept
cards
.
But
they
do
n't
.
If
you
think
about
it
,
it
almost
seems
like
they
are
going
back
to
the
good
ol'
days
of
the
general
store
.
Middleton
's
one-stop
shop
.
You
can
check
your
postal
box
,
get
your
coffee
,
get
your
paper
,
and
buy
random
goods
.
Besides
a
hitching
post
for
your
horse
,
what
more
could
you
need
?
Take
it
.
Leave
it
.
Whatever.From

,

Never
dissapointed.I
've
been
here
at
least
8
or
9
times
since
the
August
2010
review
;
time
for
an
update
.
Pros
:
+
Solid
breakfast
food
,
especially
the
special
scrambles
.
Ca
n't
miss
.
+
Great
breads
-
I
've
tried
nearly
all
of
them
and
they
're
excellent
+
Altera
coffee
+
Friendly
staff
+
Bakery
items
-LRB-
cookies/pastries
-RRB-
are
superb
Cons
:
-
Cash
only
-
Slightly
expensive
-
When
busy
,
seating
is
hard
to
come
by
;
small
space
No
complaints
with
the
food
-
it
's
always
been
high
quality
.
We
were
there
today
as
part
of
a
team
outing
,
and
several
folks
commented
about
the
pancakes
-
they
are
truly
great
,
with
a
good
sear
,
excellent
flavor
,
and
perfect
texture
.
I
had
the
scramble
,
and
it
was
as
good
as
always.I
ate
here
twice
this
week
.
The
first
time
with
5
others
for
a
lunch
meeting
;
the
second
time
with
my
wife
&
daughter
for
a
light
brunch
.
Both
days
were
warm
and
muggy
so
I
started
with
an
iced
coffee
.
Well
done
.
Ca
n't
go
wrong
with
Alterra
.
For
my
work
lunch
I
ordered
the
CBLT
,
a
nicely
toasted
BLT
with
a
thick
cut
of
bacon
and
some
cheddar
melted
in
.
The
lettuce
and
tomato
are
fresh
,
as
is
the
``
fresh
fruit
''
on
the
side
.
Today
,
my
wife
had
an
egg
sandwich
with
ham
.
It
was
huge
,
like
an
omelette
on
the
same
toasted
bread
as
my
BLT
a
few
days
before
.
The
yogurt
parfait
my
daughter
ordered
had
fresh
fruit
and
crunchy
granola
.
The
power
was
out
while
we
were
there
today
,
but
the
staff
worked
hard
to
serve
everything
on
the
menu
.
Kudos
to
them
all
and
to
this
great
little
place
in
Middleton.As
always
excellent
,
locally
sourced
food.Such
a
cute
place
!!
I
was
there
for
breakfast
,
and
had
eggs
,
bacon
,
homefries
,
toast
and
a
pancake
.
I
like
variety
,
what
can
I
say
??
Eggs
were
good
.
Bacon
and
toast
ok
.
Homefries
were
kinda
greasy
,
but
tasted
awesome
.
Totally
looked
like
they
would
be
gross
,
but
were
delicious
.
Pancake
is
where
it
's
at
.
Seriously
.
Just
perfect
.
Also
,
I
believe
they
make
their
own
pastries
.
Several
coffee
options
,
too
.
The
outside
seating
is
so
cute
,
too
.
I
was
there
on
a
weekday
morning
,
so
there
was
n't
a
whole
lot
going
on
,
but
it
was
still
fun
to
sit
outside
on
a
perfect
day
,
and
watch
the
traffic
and
people
go
by.Coffee
was
good
,
corned
beef
hash
was
OK
but
not
great
.
Service
was
very
friendly
and
prompt
.
Nice
area
outside
to
enjoy
the
sunshine
while
having
breakfast.Great
Place
.
Just
good
quality
breakfast
and
lunch
foods.Pleasant
atmosphere
,
great
coffee
,
hit
or
miss
bakery
When
I
venture
to
Middleton
to
catch
up
with
friends
over
a
cup
of
coffee
,
I
often
end
up
at
the
Prairie
Cafe
&
Bakery
.
It
's
a
short
bike
ride
from
the
53597
and
the
Alterra
Coffee
-LRB-
or
is
it
Colectivo
now
,
I
'm
so
confused
-RRB-
they
serve
beats
the
pants
off
of
what
you
can
get
from
the
neighboring
Starbucks
.
I
wish
the
outdoors
seating
area
took
advantage
of
the
nearby
Pheasant
Branch
Conservancy
.
Sipping
coffee
and
watching
the
locals
pick-up
their
dry-cleaning
just
is
n't
the
vibe
I
'm
looking
for
I
guess
.
I
ca
n't
vouch
for
the
breakfast
or
lunch
selections
,
since
I
'm
just
a
coffee
and
baked
goods
sort
of
guy
.
As
for
baked
goods
,
I
've
had
some
excellent
scones
and
muffins
at
Prairie
.
Like
scream
it
from
the
rooftop
great
.
But
not
every
time
.
Just
when
I
'm
ready
to
proclaim
Prairie
my
go
to
coffee
and
a
scone
hangout
,
I
get
a
scone
that
's
as
dry
as
Atacama
Desert
.
And
since
I
'm
dropping
some
decent
coin
here
,
I
want
better
consistency
.
Things
I
like
:
*
Love
the
staff
here
.
Even
when
the
place
is
getting
slammed
by
waves
of
morning
commuters
looking
for
their
sugar
and
caffeine
fix
,
I
always
get
a
smile
and
courteous
service
.
*
Always
love
me
some
free
wi
--
fi
.
Never
had
a
problem
connecting
or
with
download
speeds
.
*
The
noise
level
indoors
always
seems
to
be
a
soft
murmur
,
with
some
relaxing
music
wafting
in
the
background
.
Never
had
a
problem
carrying
on
a
conversation
with
my
table
mates
.
*
When
the
FDA
approves
Alterra
Coffee
for
intravenous
use
,
I
'll
be
first
in
line
.
There
are
always
are
four
or
five
roasts
to
choose
from
and
I
've
never
had
a
skunky
cup
.
Things
I
do
n't
*
The
``
cash
only
''
thing
was
so
hip
in
the
18th
century
,
but
it
's
2013
now
.
Start
taking
plastic
,
people
.
*
The
baked
goods
are
not
inexpensive
.
It
's
usually
worth
it
,
but
it
's
annoying
as
hell
when
I
lose
the
muffin
lottery
.
It
's
a
solid
three
star
option
with
lots
of
upside
if
the
bakery
improves
its
consistency.Seemed
like
a
nice
place
.
However
,
after
waiting
in
line
for
20
minutes
and
taking
quite
a
while
to
give
our
order
-LRB-
because
it
was
VERY
loud
-RRB-
we
were
told
that
it
would
take
about
30
minutes
to
get
our
food
.
Not
exactly
what
I
wanted
to
hear
after
waiting
20
minutes
but
fine
.
When
I
try
to
pay
I
am
informed
that
they
do
not
accept
debit/credit
cards
.
Cash
or
check
only
!!
No
where
on
the
door
or
while
in
line
does
it
say
cash
or
check
only
!
There
apparently
is
a
very
small
sign
on
the
register
that
says
that
but
there
is
so
much
other
crap
posted
in
that
area
99
%
of
the
people
there
probably
never
saw
the
sign
.
This
is
just
ridiculous
in
this
day
and
age
to
not
accept
cards
.
Even
worse
is
the
BS
sign
on
the
register
.
I
will
never
eat
here
again
just
because
of
this!Nice
atmosphere
.
Like
an
upscale
Starbucks
.
We
ordered
coffee
,
chai
,
a
breakfast
sandwich
and
quiche
of
the
day
.
Was
told
drinks
would
be
out
in
a
few
minutes
but
food
would
take
40
minutes
.
Do
n't
know
if
its
always
like
that
or
if
they
were
just
short
staffed
.
But
seriously
40
min
for
a
slice
of
quiche
and
a
breakfast
sandwich
?
We
told
them
just
make
the
drinks
,
forget
the
food
.
Even
so
the
drinks
took
11
minutes
.
This
place
has
potential
but
a
wait
like
that
is
crazy
.
Would
not
recommend
until
they
work
their
production
issues
out
.
One
star
.
Disappointed.Looks
great
.
Smells
great
.
When
they
told
me
it
would
be
a
30-40
minute
wait
for
a
breakfast
sandwich
I
cancelled
my
order
.
Seems
like
an
unworkable
business
model
.
Hire
another
cook
and
install
another
stove
.
Came
all
the
way
here
from
Spring
Green
--
sad
face.I
think
this
is
a
good
place
to
come
for
breakfast
or
lunch
.
The
food
is
definitely
homemade
and
tasty
.
Straightforward
and
good
quality
.
I
've
often
had
the
salads
featured
on
their
board
and
have
really
enjoyed
them
.
Additionally
,
I
've
had
soups
and
smoothies
-
also
tasty
and
homey
-LRB-
in
a
good
way
-RRB-
.
I
would
certainly
recommend
this
place
.
It
can
get
busy
.
Cash/check
only
and
open
until
2
.
Nice
place
for
meetings
.
Many
tables
spread
out
through
the
space
.
Food
is
very
good
.
Cup
of
soup
included
bread
AND
pieces
of
fruit
which
was
a
sweet
surprise
.
The
salted
pecan
pie
latte
is
also
a
nice
fall
diversion
from
pumpkin
latte
.
Nice
to
have
another
local
establishment
.
Bummed
they
only
take
cash
as
I
rarely
carry
cash
and
for
me
that
's
why
a
star
was
lost.I
had
the
Tuscan
chicken
&
3
cheese
.
Very
yummy
and
served
with
a
side
choice
.
I
chose
the
sliced
fruit
.
I
can
say
it
was
worth
the
$
10
...
not
for
just
the
food
but
the
ambiance
.
I
'd
come
back
here
to
try
another
hot
sandwich
.
Just
keep
in
mind
,
at
this
moment
the
café
is
still
cash
only
.
Walk
across
the
street
grab
yourself
some
cash
and
get
here
for
a
nice
sandwich.Great
location
,
nice
atmosphere
,
good
food
.
But
very
slow
service
,
and
overpriced
.
I
ordered
a
breakfast
sandwich
with
no
meat
--
it
took
20
minutes
and
cost
$
6.75
.
Weak
food
for
yuppies
.
Overpriced
.
Underwhelming
.
And
you
're
surrounded
by
West
Siders
who
should
really
know
better
...
but
of
course
do
n't
.
After
reading
the
last
few
reviews
,
I
had
pretty
low
expectations
for
my
lunch
at
Prairie
Cafe
&
Bakery
.
I
assumed
I
would
have
to
wait
a
long
time
for
my
food
and
it
would
be
just
okay
.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
.
Our
food
came
relatively
quickly
,
and
my
husband
and
I
both
enjoyed
our
sandwiches
.
I
had
a
CBLT
which
was
excellent
.
The
bread
was
perfect
,
and
I
loved
fresh
ingredients
and
the
special
mayo
.
My
husband
really
liked
the
special
of
the
day
,
which
was
a
tuna
melt
.
My
bean
and
corn
side
salad
was
very
fresh
tasting
,
but
could
have
used
a
tad
more
flavor
.
We
also
had
a
key
lime
coconut
cookie
that
was
AMAZING
.
I
might
have
to
go
back
next
week
just
to
get
another
one
!!
The
servers
were
n't
overly
friendly
,
but
they
definitely
were
n't
UN-friendly
.
My
only
true
``
complaint
''
is
that
it
is
a
bit
pricy
for
what
you
get
-
it
was
almost
$
30
for
our
lunch
of
two
sandwiches
,
two
drinks
,
a
cookie
and
a
kid
's
meal
-
at
least
the
kid
's
meal
included
the
drink
!
I
will
definitely
be
back
to
the
Prairie
Cafe
!
Do
n't
let
the
other
negative
reviews
scare
you
away
!
The
sandwiches
are
definitely
worth
it
!
:
-RRB-
ONLY
TAKES
CASH
OR
CHECK
!!!
So
,
this
is
not
always
a
deal
breaker
,
and
I
have
been
here
before
and
went
out
of
my
way
to
return
.
I
did
n't
either
remember
this
rule
,
or
it
changed
since
I
last
visited
,
since
I
usually
do
n't
carry
either
.
They
wo
n't
pay
the
fee
for
the
credit
card
machine
,
but
want
me
to
dish
out
money
for
checks
or
ATM
fees
...
makes
me
mad
on
principle
.
And
there
is
a
Starbucks
literally
across
the
street
or
other
local
joints
that
will
gladly
take
my
debit/credit
cards
down
the
a
little
ways
away
that
I
will
now
know
to
frequent
instead.Nice
atmosphere
and
great
food
,
especially
the
breakfast
!
The
stuffed
French
toast
special
is
fantastic
.
I
may
be
a
bit
biased
because
I
've
gone
there
growing
upMay
be
one
of
Middleton
's
best
kept
secrets
...
I
had
run
past
Paul
's
on
numerous
mornings
and
always
figured
the
illumated
``
Open
''
sign
was
an
oversight
.
Turns
out
they
really
are
open
at
7am
each
morning
,
and
that
they
do
indeed
serve
breakfast
,
including
a
prime
rib
breakfast
on
Sundays
!
While
I
have
n't
had
breakfast
from
Paul
's
yet
,
I
can
confirm
that
it
smells
great
!
We
did
enjoy
a
few
rounds
of
drinks
while
at
Paul
's
last
night
,
and
really
had
a
good
time
.
The
establishment
is
smoke-free
-LRB-
a
HUGE
bonus
in
our
book
-RRB-
,
and
is
laid
out
in
such
a
manner
that
the
place
does
n't
feel
crowded
,
even
when
it
's
busy
.
The
service
was
top
notch
;
we
never
waited
or
wanted
for
anything
,
and
we
enjoyed
watching
the
cook
prepare
a
wide
variety
of
bar
fare
with
impeccible
precision
and
ease
.
The
chicken
tenders
looked
amazing
,
as
did
the
bacon
cheeseburgers
with
grilled
onions
.
Portions
were
astronomically
huge
,
and
the
most
expensive
menu
item
was
$
6.75
.
I
ca
n't
wait
to
go
there
for
dinner
some
night
.
We
finished
our
drinks
,
paid
our
tab
,
thanked
the
staff
and
headed
home
.
We
were
thrilled
with
Paul
's
and
will
definitely
be
back
.
We
'll
update
with
a
report
on
the
food
quality
as
well
,
but
I
have
a
feeling
that
it
wo
n't
disappoint
.
Go
here
for
:
drinks
,
after
work
gatherings
,
breakfast
,
and
to
enjoy
what
appears
to
be
excellent
``

-LRB-
burgers
,

,

,

,
etc
-RRB-
.
This
is
a
local
bar
and
not
a
fine
dining
restaurant
,
but
they
have
a
very
friendly
staff
and
serve
a
great
Friday
night
all
you
can

If
you
can
get
past
the
noise
level
and
the
plain
and
simple

,
you
will

This

is

-LRB-
Bit
of
a

from

-RRB-

isnt
that
what
Yelp
is
all
about
?
Seriously
,
cheap

,
cheap

And
PLENTY
of
it
...
plus
this
place
has
been
around
for
quite
a
while
!
-LRB-
longer
than
people
might
think
-RRB-
It
delivers
on
the
name
.
I
stopped
in
after
work
for
a
drink
and
never
tried
the
food
but
this
is
not
my
kind
of
place.Good
food
,
drinks
are
priced
decently
,
super
friendly

We
stop
in
at

once
a

You

you

there

And
the
food
is
good
too.Great
neighborhood
bar
!
There
definitely
is
n't
anything
`
special
'
on
tap
here
,
but
sometimes
all
you
need
is
a
PBR
tallboy
to
quench
your
thirst
!
I
do
n't
come
for
the
drinks
anyway
-
the
burgers
are
delicious
!
The
local
Knoche
's
beef
and
fluffy
,
buttery
buns
are
SO
GOOD
.
And
this
is
the
place
to
come
for
your

You
're

What
more
could
one
ask
for?Okay
,
sorry
guys
.
.
but
I
was
NOT
impressed
.
Just
happened
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
...
so
I
decided
to
go
to
Chin
's
because
I
could
sit
outside
.
I
ordered
the
lettuce
wraps
and
the
fried
rice
.
The
meat
in
the
wraps
was
sub-standard
and
reminded
me
of
dog
food
.
The
sauce
was
pretty
much
the
only
good
part
.
The
fried
rice
was
described
to
have
veggies
and
shrimp
and
crab
...
when
it
came
out
,
it
was
so
obviously
KRAB
.
Ugh
.
I
wo
n't
be
wasting
my
money
again.Chin
's
is
my
go-to
``
fast
food
''
stop
in
my
neighborhood
.
I
fell
in
love
with
Chin
's
when
I
was
living
across
the
street
from
their
downtown
location
.
I
usually
go
with
a
selection
from
the
kid
's
menu
,
the
Smiling
Lotus
Plate
.
A
battered
chicken
breast
with
your
choice
of
sauce
-LRB-
lemon
,
sweet
&
sour
,
and
teriyaki
-
though
I
'm
sure
you
can
pick
any
sauce
,
these
are
just
the
kid-friendly
flavors
-RRB-
,
choice
of
rice
-LRB-
white
or
brown
-RRB-
,
two
cream
cheese
puffs
,
a
chocolate-coated
fortune
cookie
,
and
soda
or
milk
,
all
for
$
4.17
including
tax
.
The
SLP
is
by
far
the
best
deal
around
for
my
thrifty
needs
.
The
adult
entrees
cost
twice
as
much
,
and
though
they
offer
more
meat
,
they
do
not
include
any
of
the
other
goodies
.
One
chicken
breast
is
plenty
for
me
.
Despite
being
inexpensive
,
the
chicken
is
fairly
good
quality
-
I
've
never
had
any
gross
bits
-LRB-
like
the
weird
slimy
string
you
find
in
chicken
tenders
at
a
lot
of
places
-RRB-
.
Occasionally
the
rice
is
on
the
dry
side
,
but
that
's
why
man
invented
sauce
.
Though
9
times
out
of
10
I
opt
for
the
Smiling
Lotus
Plate
-LRB-
with
lemon
sauce
&
white
rice
,
if
you
're
wondering
-RRB-
,
occasionally
I
'll
get
the
Sesame
Chicken
.
Lots
of
chicken
,
plenty
of
rice
,
two
meals
easy.I
'm
confused
why
anyone
would
choose
to
go
here
.
To
be
clear
,
my
expectations
were
that
it
would
be
an
all
Asian
version
of
Noodles
&
Co.
.
Cheap
,
decent
,
fresh
food
.
Cheap
-
yep
Decent
-
no
Fresh
-
maybe
at
one
point
I
ordered
the
Thai
curry
noodles
.
Not
impressed
.
I
've
never
tasted
something
that
claimed
to
be
curry
with
so
little
flavor
.
My
vegetables
were
obviously
charred
and
they
still
sent
me
the
dish
.
Yuck
.
My
boyfriend
ordered
the
teriyaki
udon
,
and
the
noodles
were
too
skinny
to
be
udon
with
the
same
flavor
issues
.
Not
even
the
chili
garlic
sauce
did
much
to
it
.
Chin
's
-
good
concept
,
but
a
waste
of
money
even
at
$
6
.
Ashley
V
said
it
best
``
why
would
anyone
choose
to
go
here
?
''
I
am
still
traveling
,
and
the
indignities
of
the
Midwest
continue
.
I
did
n't
think
it
was
cheap
.
I
knew
I
was
not
going
to
get
real
Chinese
food
,
I
knew
I
was
coming
in
to
get
a
pseudo
version
of
Americanized
Chinese
food
.
My
first
indication
that
I
was
not
in
Peking
,
was
the
Hispanic
girl
struggling
to
understand
my
English
ordering
and
the
POS
system
which
was
also
in
English
.
Damn
oppressive
society
.
Anyway
,
I
really
should
not
disparage
global
initiative
the
restaurant
is
embracing
.
We
are
all
going
to
be
working
for
Indian
companies
,
as
Obama
went
specifically
to
India
to
procure
15
million
jobs
to
alleviate
the
unemployment
crisis
in
this
country
.
I
welcome
TATA
motors
and
their
cardboard
framed
cars
.
I
digress
...
Rosa
,
or
whatever
her
name
was
,
with
the
help
of
her
friend
,
Miguel
-LRB-
probably
not
his
name
,
and
he
was
clearly
only
working
there
because
it
was
too
cold
for
his
primary
profession
,
that
being
a
jockey
-RRB-
managed
to
screw
up
my
order
twice
,
overcharged
me
twice
and
never
apologized
.
Almost
thought
I
was
in
Los
Angeles
again
.
The
cream
cheese
puffs
were
soggy
,
greasy
and
about
as
far
from
``
puffy
''
as
one
could
get
.
The
chicken
was
white
,
but
it
was
also
fatty
and
grisly
.
The
Thai
spring
rolls
were
not
bad
flavor
but
they
too
were
greasy
and
not
very
crispy
.
The
fried
rice
was
disgusting
,
just
a
greasy
mush
of
dirty
looking
rice
,
mushrooms
and
egg
.
Finally
,
the
pot
stickers
,
ah
the
pot
stickers
,
they
should
have
stuck
to
the
pot
.
The
filling
was
some
processed
mash
of
something
,
while
the
outside
was
supposed
to
have
been
lightly
pan
fried
,
let
's
emphasize
the
word
``
lightly
.
''
This
is
not
very
good
Asian
food
.
I
would
suggest
that
there
must
be
a
better
choice
in
Madison
.
I
am
sure
there
are
Asians
in
Madison
.
I
have
not
seen
them
,
but
somewhere
in
this
land
must
lay
a
pocket
of
Asians
.
There
is
a
university
,
with
a
math
and
an
engineering
department
.
There
has
to
be
Asians
somewhere
,
I
would
suggest
to
find
them
,
and
ask
them
where
to
eat
.
I
am
sure
Chin
's
would
not
be
on
their
list.For
what
it
is
,
a
fast
food
Americanized
Oriental
restaurant
,
it
's
not
overly
bad
,
as
long
as
you
do
n't
order
shrimp
.
Service
:
I
've
never
had
a
problem
here
.
While
not
always
the
most
outgoing
service
,
they
are
friendly
.
My
order
is
always
ready
in
a
decent
amount
of
time
.
I
've
never
dined
in
,
so
I
wo
n't
comment
on
atmosphere
.
Their
menu
and
nutritional
info
is
easily
accessed
on
line
.
For
the
most
part
,
I
've
had
OK
experiences
with
the
food
selections
.
I
do
n't
expect
spectacular
food
from
this
place
,
it
is
,
after
all
,
`
Fast
Food
'
from
a
restaurant
chain
.
It
's
nothing
really
special
.
However
,
today
I
had
an
experience
that
sort
of
turned
my
stomach
a
bit
.
I
ordered
a
Shrimp
and
Veggie
Stir
fry
to
go
.
When
I
got
back
to
work
and
went
to
dig
in
,
I
was
a
little
disgusted
to
find
that
the
shrimp
were
not
deveined
prior
to
cooking
.
For
those
of
you
who
do
n't
know
what
that
means
:
The
Shrimp
's
digestive
track
-LRB-
seen
as
a
dark
brown
`
vein
'
along
the
spine
of
the
shrimp
-RRB-
was
n't
removed
,
which
means
that
the
digestive
track
and
it
's
contents
were
left
in
place
.
Yes
,
I
know
it
's
not
horrible
to
eat
it
,
but
if
you
know
what
it
is
,
it
can
turn
your
stomach
.
I
assumed
that
a
restaurant
such
as
this
would
devein
shrimp
prior
to
cooking
.
I
pulled
all
the
shrimp
and
deveined
them
myself
,
but
I
'd
already
lost
my
appetite
.
I
did
put
the
shrimp
aside
and
ate
some
of
the
brown
rice
and
veggies
,
but
with
my
stomach
already
feeling
a
bit
nauseous
,
that
did
n't
go
well
.
So
now
I
'm
left
with
an
$
8
meal
sitting
on
my
desk
-LRB-
soon
to
hit
the
garbage
-RRB-
with
only
about
1/8th
of
it
consumed
and
having
to
find
an
alternative
for
lunch
.
Lesson
learned
,
if
I
'm
craving
a
good
stir
fry
with
shrimp
,
shell
out
the
extra
cash
for
PF
Changs
.
****
I
thought
eventually
I
'd
go
back
,
but
I
have
n't
been
since
then
.
We
had
some
of
their
food
catered
in
for
work
,
it
was
overcooked
,
rubbery
,
and
chewy
.
yeah
,
next
time
I
'll
get
my
own
lunch.I
've
definitely
had
better
.
The
overall
quality
of
all
the
food
...
veggies
and
chicken
,
was
definitely
poor
.
I
ate
it
but
will
definitely
not
go
there
again!My
husband
and
I
went
out
here
on
our
date
night
.
Walking
through
the
door
we
instantly
thought
Noodles
and
Co.
due
to
the
menu
layout
on
the
wall
.
It
being
our
first
time
here
we
made
it
through
the
typical
awkward
stage
of
processing
the
scene
to
figure
out
how
to
order
and
the
drink
situation
.
-LRB-
they
have
a
soda
fountain
that
is
hard
to
see
to
the
left
-RRB-
My
husband
was
very
satisfied
with
the
place
but
I
'm
still
a
little
reserved
.
I
got
the
stirfry
which
was
okay
.
I
think
the
crunchy
vegetables
were
the
best
.
The
stir
fry
sauce
was
a
little
bland
for
my
liking
.
As
usual
my
husband
shared
with
me
a
piece
of
his
sesame
chicken
and
I
instantly
got
jealous
.
I
wanted
his
plate
.
LOL
For
two
people
w
drinks
two
appetizers
-LRB-
2
spring
rolls
,
3
cream
cheese
puffs
-RRB-
plus
each
upgrading
to
10
ingredient
fried
rice
$
1.75
it
to
$
27
and
change
.
We
had
a
living
social
coupon
for
$
20
my
husband
still
wants
to
come
back
but
if
I
do
I
'm
ordering
off
the
classic
menu
as
he
did
.
Live
and
learn
I
guess
.
:-RRB-
A
plus
,
they
have
an
outside
patio.After
going
to
the
Chin
's
on
State
St.
I
was
pretty
sure
I
'd
never
go
to
Chin
's
again
.
But
this
location
is
close
to
my
work
and
a
coworker
invited
me
.
Perhaps
I
am
also
weak
?
Anyway
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
,
for
whatever
reason
,
the
food
here
seemed
much
better
.
It
could
maybe
be
argued
that
the
noodles
are
a
little
heavy
on
the
sauce
,
but
everything
else
seemed
fine
.
The
tofu
and
veggies
are
well
prepared
and
chewable
-LRB-
not
the
case
on
State
St
!
-RRB-
and
really
that
's
all
I
need
.
In
addition
the
staff
is
always
pleasant
and
the
food
comes
out
quickly.We
LOVE
this
place
.
Food
is
excellent
,
service
fast
,
huge
portions
,
reasonable
prices
.
Egg
drop
soup
,
spring
rolls
,
bourbon
chicken
with

fried
rice
--
fantastic
.
You
will
not
be
sorry
you
visited
.
On
nice
evenings
or
lunches
,
eat
outside
.
The
food
was
alright
,
the
service
was
alright
,
the
portion
size
was
generous
,
the
prices
was
alright
.
3
stars
for
a
decent
place
to
grab
food
if
you
're
in
a
hurry
,
but
nothing
special.I
was
in
the
area
.
I
was
about
to
go
to
Pho
Nam
but
decided
to
try
Chins
.
My
first
impression
was
that
this
was
a
lot
like
Noodles
and
company
with
a
Chinese
decor
.
It
felt
it
fell
short
in
ambiance
and
flavor
for
me
.
I
ordered
the
Thai
Noodles
.
Thai
Noodles
:
wide
Asian
noodles
with
bok
choy
,
red
onions
,
pea
pods
,
and
water
chestnuts
in
coconut
curry
with
Thai
seasonings
,
garnished
with
lime
,
red
pepper
,
and
sprouts
.
I
did
n't
feel
like
this
had
a
lot
of
flavor
.
It
was
barely
coconut
curry
and
actually
had
a
flavor
that
was
different
from
anything
I
have
ever
had
before
.
The
vegetable
were
fresh
and
the
portion
was
good
.
My
overall
experience
was
so
so
but
I
still
ended
up
having
a
good
time
because
I
was
able
to
witness
an
exchange
between
some
people
that
was
something
like
a
scene
out
of
the
movie
Slacker
by
Linklater
.
It
was
awkward
.
A
true
cringe
moment
.
Bizarre
.
Some
people
can
be
so
cold
and
insensitive
.
It
went
on
for
about
5
minutes
and
really
made
my
stop
there
interesting
.
There
were
a
lot
of
people
here
from
what
it
looked
like
they
were
on
lunch
from
nearby
businesses
.
The
folks
here
really
work
their
butts
off
.
But
the
food
and
the
restaurant
could
be
so
much
better.Much
like
it
's
former
State
Street
counterpart
,
this
place
used
to
be
awesome
.
The
food
is
still
good
,
but
it
's
not
so
fast
anymore
and
the
ingredients
seem
to
be
a
bit
skimpy
.
My
10
Ingredient
Fried
Rice
had
about
4
shrimp
.
Lame
.
Still
-
it
's
all
delicious
.
But
I
never
used
to
have
to
wait
15
minutes
and
it
all-around
used
to
be
shinier.We
love
Asia
Fresh
.
bourbon
chicken
with
veg
fried
rice-perfect
.
Take
away
done
quickly
.
service
great
.
Great
price.We
did
takeout
from
here
and
both
thought
our
dinners
were
awesome
.
We
ordered
:
-
Chicken
wings
with
Sesame
Szechuan
sauce
-LRB-
you
can
get
them
with
any
stir
fry
sauce
choice
-RRB-
-
Hot
and
sour
soup
-
Thai
spring
rolls
-
Sesame
chicken
-
Sweet
and
sour
chicken
.
Then
we
got
stuck
in
rush
hour/post
blizzard
traffic
and
had
a
40
minute
commute
home
.
We
were
both
impressed
how
well
the
food
held
up
after
that
amount
of
time
!
The
flavor
of
the
wings
was
good
,
but
they
were
obviously
no
longer
hot
.
Next
time
we
will
try
those
when
we
dine
in
.
Everything
else
had
lots
of
heat
and
flavor
.
The
hot
and
sour
soup
looked
different
than
any
other
I
have
eaten
,
but
it
was
still
good
and
plenty
hot
.
I
did
not
detect
much
sour
in
it
,
my
only
small
complaint
.
We
both
felt
we
had
more
than
enough
food
for
$
23
,
and
the
quality
was
great
.
We
will
definitely
go
back
.
I
am
actually
a
little
shocked
at
all
the
bad
reviews
on
this
place
after
our
dining
experience
.
Not
sure
if
they
have
improved
things
or
we
just
hit
it
on
a
good
night
.
Service
was
fast
,
friendly
and
accurate
...
no
complaints
there.The
food
here
is
quite
good
actually
.
Not
5
star
restaurant
quality
but
for
the
price
and
service
,
it
's
decent
.
The
staff
was
friendly
and
I
did
n't
wait
long
in
line
.
The
teriyaki
chicken
and
cream
puffs
are
my
favorites
and
even
though
the
chocolate
covered
fortune
cookie
was
meant
for
little
kids
,
I
still
have
the
balls
to
ask
for
one
lol
.
Overall
,
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
.
Oh
and
I
'll
say
it
straight
off
the
bat
,
this
place
is
not
authentic
asian
food
.
But
for
what
it
is
-LRB-
which
is
pan
asian
fast
food
-RRB-
,
it
did
not
disappoint
me.Fast
food
Chinese
is
generally
not
that
exciting
,
but
I
must
say
this
place
really
was
quite
impressive
.
Very
fresh
tasting
ingredients
with
a
lot
of
good
flavors
,
all
served
hot
and
with
a
smile
.
What
more
could
you
ask
for?A
fast-casual
spin-off
of
a
Minnesota-based
,
fast-food
Chinese-American
chain
that
likewise
serves
nothing
special
,
Chin
's
gets
one
star
for
being
the
only
Asian-American
place
I
know
of
in
Dane
County
that
serves
fried
cream
cheese
wontons
without
crabmeat
.
I
require
a
side
dish
of
epinephrine
if
I
eat
crab
,
so
I
appreciate
this
omission
.
Now
that
I
have
established
that
I
go
here
just
for
the
cream
cheese
puffs
,
it
should
be
clear
that
I
'm
far
from
an
expert
on
Asian
food
.
So
take
the
rest
of
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
;
there
should
be
plenty
to
spare
in
your
entree
.
I
used
to
think
this
place
was
ok
--
it
still
has
plenty
of
variety
,
a
very
friendly
staff
,
good
chili-garlic
sauce
,
decent
potstickers
,
above-average
lettuce
wraps
,
no
grisly
or
fatty
pieces
of
meat
--
but
lately
the
preparation
has
been
sloppy
and
the
presentation
just
as
bad
.
I
suspect
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
has
come
down
a
notch
.
After
cream
cheese
wontons
,
Pad
Thai
is
one
of
my
favorite
Asian
entrees
.
My
last
order
looked
like
Goldilocks
's
porridge
in
the
``
Three
Little
Bears
''
Golden
Book
I
had
as
a
kid
.
Dull
gray
,
soupy
,
greasy
,
salty
and
watery
,
yet
somehow
sticky
.
The
chopped
peanuts
added
no
crunch
at
all
,
which
is
too
bad
because
other
than
the
chicken
pieces
I
picked
through
the
mess
to
find
,
I
was
hoping
to
find
something
else
edible
.
Epic
fail
on
this
entree
.
On
my
next
visit
,
I
ordered
the
Firecracker
noodles
with
chicken
,
as
a
side
to
my
beloved
wontons
.
Slight
improvement
from
last
time
but
still
salty
as
the
Dead
Sea
and
enough
grease
to
de-squeak
every
door
hinge
on
the
west
side
.
The
bag
was
so
heavy
I
skipped
my
biceps
workout
for
a
week
.
The
red
peppers
had
no
life
left
.
Again
,
I
hunted
and
pecked
for
the
chicken
,
which
is
consistently
decent-quality
,
well-prepared
white
meat
.
My
wife
's
veggie
fried
rice
would
have
been
ok
--
they
ease
up
on
the
salt
and
Valvoline
for
this
entree
--
but
the
vegetables
were
overcooked
and
charred
in
places
.
Fresh
veggies
should
present
as
a
bright
spectrum
of
colors
--
orange
from
the
carrots
,
bright
green
from
the
scallions
,
broccoli
and
pea
pods
,
yellow
from
the
corncobettes
.
Instead
,
however
,
they
were
the
same
brown
color
as
the
fried
rice
.
My
last
fortune
cookie
said
I
'll
probably
return
to
Chin
's
.
It
's
on
the
way
home
from
work
,
the
food
comes
out
fast
and
I
ca
n't
resist
those
damn
cream
cheese
wontons
.
Maybe
I
'll
throw
in
some
potstickers
or
wraps
and
call
it
dinner.I
like
that
I
can
add
items
to
a
base
entree
to
make
it
my
own
.
I
love
the
Thai
peanut
lo
mein
.
the
noodles
were
easy
to
eat
-LRB-
they
were
cut
shorter
-RRB-
.
We
tried
to
order
for
delivery
because
we
are
4
miles
away
.
On
their
menu
it
says
$
15
minimum
.
We
called
to
place
the
order
and
we
were
told
today
it
's
a
$
75
minimum
.
We
found
that
insane
so
never
ordered.I
always
get
the
lemon
chicken
and
it
's
delicious
!
Nice
light
batter
and
very
crispy
with
a
good
amount
of
sauce
.
The
potstickers
are
also
very
good.Only
thing
less
disappointing
then
the
food
is
the
staff
.
Ordered
Chin
Wings
,
Hot
&
Sour
soup
and
Sesame
Chicken
to
go
.
.
What
I
get
in
return
is
Chin
Wings
with
the
wrong
stir
fry
sauce
,
a
cup
of
hot
&
sour
and
lemon
chicken
.
They
charged
me
for
what
I
ordered
,
yet
they
still
refused
a
refund
me
or
to
replace
my
food
.
.
Avoid
this
place
like
the
plague.The
food
was
decent
.
But
yet
again
,
the
staff
managed
to
screw
my
order
up
and
ended
up
charging
me
more
then
what
I
should
of
payed
for.We
come
here
a
lot
and
the
food
is
never
consistent
.
Sometimes
it
's
really
salty
.
Other
times
it
's
too
spicy
or
not
spicy
enough
.
There
must
be
several
different
cooks
because
the
sauce
is
never
the
same
either
.
We
still
like
the
adventure
of
what
we
may
get
today
.
Stop
for
quick
bite
on
the
way
home
.
If
you
tried
it
and
did
n't
like
it
you
may
want
to
try
again
,
you
may
be
surprised
at
how
much
better
or
different
the
next
time
may
be
.
The
servers
here
are
friendly
enough
but
some
times
they
difficult
to
read
.
Place
is
not
always
clean
but
it
's
clean
enough
.
I
do
n't
like
the
fact
that
some
of
the
tables
are
falling
apart
but
there
is
always
customers
here
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right.Good
food
and
prices
are
reasonable!I
will
never
order
from
there
again
.
I
called
to
find
out
what
was
on
the
hot
and
spicy
chicken
.
The
person
who
answered
informed
me
that
it
was
both
hot
and
spicy
but
it
was
serves
with
broccoli
,
snow
peas
and
onions
.
Once
I
got
my
entree
it
was
neither
hot
nor
spicy
.
On
top
of
that
,
there
was
no
broccoli
.
Too
many
onions
,
barely
any
snow
peas
AND
a
very
small
amount
of
chicken
.
Did
I
mention
that
I
do
n't
think
the
chicken
was
actually
chicken
?
It
was
cut
so
thin
and
had
no
chicken
flavor
.
The
white
rice
that
accompanied
my
dish
was
mushy
and
clumped
together
.
I
've
made
better
rice
boiling
it
.
My
mom
had
the
Kung
pao
chicken
and
she
was
also
dissatisfied
with
her
meal
.
The
crab
Rangoon
was
ok
...
Fairly
basic
.
I
wo
n't
return
there
.
I
would
prefer
to
give
it
a
ZEROHubby
has
been
eating
here
for
years
but
since
I
only
occasionally
visit
WI
,
he
never
convinced
me
to
give
this
little
dive
a
try
.
Now
I
'm
sad
about
what
i
've
been
missing
!
Can
not
understand
how
they
do
it
for
SO
cheap
-
amazingly
fresh
,
tasty
,
generous
Chinese
.
Clean
,
open
kitchen
,
very
fast
and
large
variety
.
Liked
it
so
much
that
I
got
a
lunch
special
to
go
for
the
bus
ride
over
to
O'Hare
.
They
packed
it
up
tight
but
remember
to
take
napkins
,
condiments
and
utensils
.
I
loved
the
shrimp
with
broccoli
-LRB-
also
had
carrots
-RRB-
and
the
shrimp
were
large
and
plentiful
.
Wonton
soup
-LRB-
4
big
dumplings
-RRB-
on
a
cold
day
was
delish
and
included
in
the
lunch
special
.
Also
got
chicken
egg
foo
yung
which
included
large
,
well
filled
egg
roll
-
also
tasty
,
mustardy
sauce
OK
-LRB-
not
as
good
as
the
brown
sauce
I
'm
used
to
-RRB-
.
All
lunch
specials
include
roast
pork
fried
rice
which
was
good
enough
to
buy
on
its
own
.
Seems
like
a
mom/pop
place
so
support
your
local
Chinese
joint
-
down
with
PF/PW/PE
.
We
go
here
pretty
regularly
.
The
food
is
good
,
but
by
no
means
great
.
It
is
pretty
divey
looking
-LRB-
photos
of
food
,
etc
-RRB-
and
they
mess
up
our
order
abt
20
%
of
the
time
,
but
still
a
good
value
for
the
price
.
General
Tso
's
chicken
is
great
.
I
asked
for
brown
rice
once
and
they
gave
us
fried
rice
...
to
their
credit
,
it
was
brown
:
-RRB-
I
have
ordered
food
from
here
on
numerous
occasions
.
It
's
always
been
good
and
reasonably
priced
.
I
wish
they
delivered
.
That
is
the
only
drawback.Went
to
Denny
's
this
morning
for
breakfast
with
my
twins
and
fiance
.
We
walked
in
the
door
and
their
was
no
hostess
which
is
understandable
if
they
are
busy
but
they
really
were
n't
.
We
had
at
least
five
servers
look
dead
at
us
as
well
as
cooks
and
stood
there
for
a
good
five
minutes
and
still
no
one
said
anything
to
us
so
we
walked
out
and
went
to
the
McDonald
's
across
the
street.always
great
food
with
great
service
.
Nothing
too
fancy
but
fills
you
up
and
gets
you
on
the
way.Hard
to
rate
a
McDonald
's
well
.
I
go
through
the
drive
thru
most
mornings
for
coffee
and
will
eat
lunch
there
from
time
to
time
.
Drive
thru
service
is
always
great
and
restaurant
is
always
clean
.
They
hire
and
retain
good
help.This
might
be
the
best
run
McDonalds
in
the
Madison
area
.
The
drive-through
runs
incredibly
fast
!
Plus
,
it
's
a
throw
back
McDonalds
with
a
displayed
old
milkshake
machine
that
triggered
Ray
Kroc
's
involvement
in
the
company
,
and
resulted
in
him
bringing
in
a
franchise
model
that
facilitated
the
restaurant
's
world-wide
domination
.
However
,
who
checks
for
a
McDonalds
rating?I
ate
here
on
Dec
1st
-LRB-
big
mac
combo
-RRB-
and
it
did
not
feel
well
after
words
.
I
learned
that
they
and
all
Mc
D
's
use
ammoniated
beef
,
it
is
frank
`
in
food
.
Madison
is
full
of
privately
owned
restaurants
that
serve
real
food
,
not
chemical
and
byproducts
dressed
up
as
food
.
Save
your
kids
,
save
your
self
.
Just
say
no
to
the
evil
fake
foodThe
Hody
is
a
pretty
solid
local
bar
in
Middleton
that
often
has
great
live
music
and
decent
drink
specials
.
Thursday
nights
feature
Westside
Andy
&
Mel
Ford
,
and
that
is
always
a
good
time
.
There
are
decent
taps
,
though
last
time
I
was
there
I
believe
they
had
removed
Esser
's
Best
which
was
my
go-to
every
time
there
.
Most
of
the
specials
tend
toward
the
$
1
shot
variety
,
but
I
especially
like
that
Capital
pints
are
$
2
on
Wednesdays
and
you
can
get
pitchers
of
Spotted
on
Fridays
for
a
crazy
$
5
.
I
also
learned
that
your
second
drink
before
noon
on
Sundays
is
free
,
and
domestic
taps
are
50
cents
.
More
on
that
later
.
The
bartenders
are
for
the
most
part
good
,
but
if
you
're
there
on
the
wrong
day
they
seem
to
forget
about
you
in
favor
of
talking
with
the
regulars
.
The
food
is
pretty
standard
:
not
too
fancy
but
good
.
Sometimes
the
food
does
n't
come
as
advertised
in
the
menu
.
Once
I
ordered
a
Reuben
that
strangely
was
lacking
Swiss
cheese
,
though
I
did
n't
notice
until
halfway
through
as
it
was
still
a
tasty
sandwich
.
I
like
the
bison
burger
here
,
but
the
last
time
I
ordered
this
it
came
sans
tomatoes
,
likely
due
to
the
salmonella
issue
at
the
time
.
Also
that
day
my
sister
found
the
Hody
Chicken
's
buffalo
sauce
to
be
beyond
her
tolerance
for
spiciness
.
My
sister
's
boyfriend
was
suitably
impressed
with
the
Hody
burger
,
but
he
thought
that
they
had
left
of
the
special
Hody
sauce
.
It
might
have
just
been
a
bad
day
,
because
most
of
the
other
times
I
've
been
here
there
were
no
problems
.
I
do
believe
that
the
overall
quality
depends
on
the
day
you
stop
in
.
Some
of
the
bartenders
kind
of
throw
things
together
,
while
others
take
their
time
and
do
a
decent
job
.
I
have
n't
been
there
regularly
enough
to
establish
a
schedule
,
so
it
's
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
lately
.
I
've
also
tried
a
few
of
the
appetizers
and
the
onion
straws
and
quesidilla
wrappers
are
very
good
every
time
I
've
had
them
.
The
main
drawback
with
the
Hody
is
the
regular
crowd
.
On
Thursdays
when
Westside
Andy
&
Mel
Ford
are
playing
the
crowd
is
great
-
a
variety
of
people
,
young
and
old
,
some
dancing
to
the
music
,
some
sitting
at
the
bar
or
nearby
tables
.
Other
nights
the
crowd
can
get
a
bit
too
townie
for
my
liking
.
It
can
be
uncomfortable
,
especially
when
half
the
bar
turns
to
look
at
you
when
you
walk
in
.
Sundays
can
be
the
worst
.
I
think
that
some
of
those
people
nearly
live
there
.
The
place
is
pretty
open
and
there
is
a
lot
of
space
,
but
it
still
can
get
quite
smoky
.
There
is
a
few
outdoor
tables
along
Elmwood
,
and
these
are
perfect
for
a
weekend
afternoon
.
I
would
probably
return
to
the
Hody
more
if
it
were
n't
for
the
small
inconsistencies
in
the
food
and
the
slight
hostile
feeling
that
I
sometimes
pick
up
from
the
regulars
,
but
overall
the
Hody
is
a
reliably
good
time.They
have
decent
drink
specials
.
However
the
bar
is
sometimes
filled
with
older
trashier
drunks
.
Its
defintely
an
older
crowd
where
Cougars
are
lurking
.
On
the
weekend
they
have
free
live
music
.
Its
usually
too
loud
to
converse
with
your
group
but
the
bands
usually
ar
n't
terrible
.
Ive
never
had
their
food
but
Ive
heard
its
pretty
decent
.
Overall
it
an
ok
place
to
go
to
get
a
few
drinks
.
Sadly
its
one
of
the
better
bars
in
Middleton
.
Not
as
much
of
a
dive
as
the
Club
Tavern
or
Bristled
Boar
and
not
as
Towny
as
Pauls
grill
...
And
if
your
into
older
trashy
women
this
place
is
for
you.Just
had
to
review
to
mention
my
addiction
.
The
Hody
Club
.
Its
a
club
sandwich
with
a
fried
egg
on
it
.
Most
will
think
it
sounds
gross
.
They
do
something
to
make
this
sandwich
just
magical
.
SO
good
-
I
want
one
every
time
I
hear
Hody
.
Yum
.
They
also
have
awesome
Quesadilla
's
too
.
We
usually
get
ours
with
spicy
,
but
I
think
you
can
customize
.
Otherwise
a
decent
bar
with
average
prices
and
service
.
Good
TVs
and
a
very
local
crowd
.
I
think
they
have
small
bands
on
the
weekends.Absolutely
the
best
club
sandwich
I
have
had
in
a
looong
time
.
I
order
it
everytime
I
go
and
it
has
never
been
less
than
awesome
.
And
it
's
priced
really
well
.
Anytime
I
've
gone
at
night
the
crowd
is
a
little
rough
looking
and
the
music
is
too
loud
.
But
going
in
the
early
evening
or
for
lunch
usually
works
pretty
well.Went
here
for
lunch
because
we
had
coupons
for
bogo
sandwiches
.
The
food
was
pretty
good
for
a
little
WI
bar
!
The
biggest
downfall
was
that
their
freezer
had
just
broken
so
we
could
not
get
any
fried
apps
.
The
waitress
did
let
us
use
both
of
our
coupons
even
though
she
said
they
were
one
per
table
-LRB-
that
was
not
printed
on
them
-RRB-
but
still
nice
of
her
!
SO
CHEAP
!
Out
bill
was
around
$
20
for
4
people
!?
I
'm
from
a
small
town
in
Kentucky
.
I
likely
wo
n't
attend
my
30-year
high
school
reunion
,
but
I
imagine
it
will
look
exactly
like
Hody
's
.
Lotta
flannel
shirts
and
fiddle
playing
in
here
tonight
.
Cowboy
hats
,
beards
,
and
MILFs
a
`
prowling
.
God
bless
America
.
The
only
drawback
is
that
there
seems
to
be
a
raspy
,
sideshow
bob
type
of
lady
chain-smoking
outside
.
I
guess
that
comes
with
the
territory
.
The
skating
rink
cheese
sticks
more
than
make
up
for
that
spectacle.Happened
to
be
here
for
a
recent
Packer
game
,
partly
cuz
they
advertise
half
price
apps
during
the
game
and
partly
cuz
of
their
presence
in
`
Madison
Cocktail
'
book.Service
was
sketchy
at
best.Waited
10-15
minutes
for
a
beer
and
then
was
advised
only
`
select
'
apps
were
half
price
-LSB-
2-3
of
16
on
menu
-RSB-
?!
Hmmm.Also
use
of
the
cocktail
book
was
viewed
as
a
nuisance
.
I
say
if
you
sell
them
readily
accept
them
...
In
summary
,
felt
like
the
customer
catered
to
the
server
rather
than
vice
versa
To
their
credit
Hody
club
sandwich
was
very
good.A
wide
variety
of
people
mingle
at
this
bar
...
classy
,
trashy
,
young
,
old
,
professional
,
you
name
it
.
The
band
was
o.k.
,
the
beer
was
not
very
cold
but
the
prices
were
ok
for
the
area
.
This
place
needs
to
place
more
emphasis
on
bartenders
that
are
courteous
and
clean
in
appearance
.
Probably
the
longest
wait
for
a
drink
in
an
unpopulated
establishment
!!
Tip
accordinglyMy
boyfriend
and
I
headed
out
to
Louisianne
's
on
the
recommendation
of
a
couple
of
his
friends
.
We
were
encouraged
to
make
reservations
as
the
couple
noted
how
this
place
is
frequently
filled
to
capacity
every
night
.
Well
,
Sunday
night
it
's
not
so
.
And
that
's
when
we
went
.
Louisianne
's
is
located
underground
,
and
the
atmosphere
below
is
warm
and
inviting
.
To
the
left
is
the
bar
with
the
piano
and
stage
for
the
jazz
bands
that
play
nearly
every
night
.
In
front
of
and
to
the
right
are
small
,
white-clothed
tables
.
Our
service
was
excellent
.
Because
there
happened
to
be
so
few
people
there
that
night
,
the
host
and
the
waitress
were
both
quite
talkative
and
welcoming
.
The
meal
was
delicious
-LRB-
you
do
n't
need
appetizers
here
-
the
entree
portions
are
QUITE
large
-RRB-
.
I
highly
recommend
it
and
ca
n't
wait
to
go
back
for
the
nights
of
live
jazz.BEST.CREME.BRULEE.EVER
!!
And
the
food
,
the
piano
bar
,
the
service
is
ABSOLUTELY
to
die
for
.
Louisiannes
is
the
kind
of
place
that
you
can
GENUINELY
never
go
wrong
.
It
's
in
an
underground
cave
,
very
``
Adams
Family
Values
''
-LRB-
Ok
,
is
n't
it
bad
that
I
compare
it
to
a
movie
-RRB-
,
their
wine
list
is
VERY
extensive
,
and
if
you
go
at
~
6ish
,
there
's
always
the
piano
man
,
ready
to
delect
you
with
a
rendition
of
a
bluesy
jazzy
tune
...
While
I
think
reservation
is
HIGHLY
recommended
-LRB-
there
's
like
10
tables
at
MOST
-RRB-
,
it
just
so
happens
that
everytime
my
husband
and
I
go
,
we
can
get
in
.
.
Lucky
us
!!!
Seriously
,
by
far
one
of
the
BEST
restaurants
in
Madison
-LRB-
whoops
Middleton
-RRB-
.
Yum
-
I
love
Louisianne
's
.
A
bit
fancy
for
every
day
,
but
the
food
is
fantastic
,
the
atmosphere
in
the
restaurant
is
great
and
the
service
has
always
been
good
.
Very
delicious
!
I
ca
n't
wait
to
go
back!Grade
:
C
Skip
the
overpriced
,
nasty
Cajun
food
and
go
for
the
desserts
!
Very
pricey
.
I
plan
to
give
this
place
another
try
soon.One
of
my
favorite
dining
experiences
in
the
Madison
area
.
The
underground
atmosphere
at
Louisianne
's
is
quaint
yet
not
unsophisticated
;
we
went
on
the
eve
of
a
snowstorm
,
so
the
pianist
did
n't
make
it
in
to
play
--
though
I
'm
sure
he
would
have
made
a
nice
dinnertime
addition
.
Service
was
friendly
and
efficient
.
Our
lemon
artichoke
appetizer
was
excellent
--
akin
to
bruschetta
,
but
minus
the
tomatoes
and
plus
pine
nuts
and
a
decadent
lemon-y
parmesan
topping
.
For
an
entree
,
I
ordered
the
blackened
catfish
with
spinach
mashed
potatoes
,
and
was
n't
disappointed
...
though
I
will
say
my
fish
was
seasoned
on
the
heavy
side
.
I
did
n't
mind
the
additional
kick
,
but
you
may
want
to
let
the
staff
know
if
you
do
n't
like
the
sensation
of
blackened
fire-breathing
between
bites
.
I
was
also
pleased
with
the
wine
selection
.
And
really
,
how
can
you
go
wrong
with
the
chocolate
creme
brulee
for
dessert
?
Thanks
,
Louisianne
's
,
for
a
warm
,
inviting
dinner
--
and
for
heating
me
up
with
enough
cajun
spice
to
temporarily
make
me
forget
how
blustery
it
is
outdoors!Tops
:
Ambiance
,
particularly
on
a
cold
winter
night
.
Wine
list
-
well
balanced
and
fairly
priced
.
Sitting
at
the
bar
listening
to
music
-
you
could
do
it
all
night
.
Food
:
Good
,
but
can
be
a
bit
over-rich
at
times
and
it
is
not
cheap
.
Desserts
are
uber
.
Service
:
For
me
,
it
has
always
been
good.Not
knock
your
socks
off
but
good
.
Atmosphere
in
the
downstairs
dining
room
is
nice
quiet
.
A
good
place
to
go
with
friends
and
have
a
conversation
.
I
had
the
escargot
which
was
good
--
could
have
had
a
little
more
garlic
.
Red
beans
&
rice
was
especially
good
.
Salad
was
average
.
For
out
of
towners
staying
at
the
``
big
box
''
motels
at
the
edge
of
town
this
place
is
way
better
than
the
chain
restaurants
around
the
motels
and
well
worth
the
short
walk
into
town
-LRB-
maybe
not
in
winter
-RRB-
.
I
was
really
excited
to
come
here
and
usually
really
like
cajun
food
.
What
I
got
was
a
plate
full
of
super-salty
rice
and
beans
.
I
could
n't
finish
it
and
left
hungry
.
I
'm
hoping
it
was
just
a
mistake
.
I
'll
give
it
another
try
one
of
these
days.I
decided
,
after
much
positive
feedback
from
clients
of
mine
-LRB-
and
a
peek
at
my
fellow
yelpers
reviews
-RRB-
,
to
surprise
my
BF
with
dinner
at
Louisianne
's
for
our
third
anniversary
tonight
.
From
the
moment
we
walked
in
,
I
was
really
charmed
.
It
has
this
cavernous
feel
-LRB-
in
a
good
,
cozy
romantic
way
--
not
a
dank
,
moldy
creepy
way
-RRB-
with
nice
lighting
and
just
all
around
nice
ambiance
.
Our
waitress
was
good
,
if
a
bit
overzealous
...
and
I
loved
the
fact
that
she
automatically
brought
me
a
small
carafe
of
iced
tea
when
she
brought
my
filled
glass
.
Nice
.
I
'm
a
heavy
-LRB-
tea
-RRB-
drinker
,
so
this
was
great
!
I
enjoyed
my
shrimp
and
corn
chowder
,
but
I
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
a
bit
more
shrimp
-LRB-
but
when
is
TOO
MUCH
shrimp
ever
possible
-RRB-
.
I
also
had
roasted
shrimp
for
my
entree
,
which
were
delicious
!
Nice
spicy
flavor
,
with
a
ton
of
rosemary
.
I
was
n't
too
impressed
with
the
side
of
spinach
and
tomatoes
,
however
.
The
Cabernet
reduction
that
they
came
DOUSED
in
was
a
bit
too
rich
.
I
wish
it
had
been
more
of
a
glaze
than
a
heavy
sauce
.
No
matter
,
I
was
too
full
to
eat
much
of
it
anyhow
.
My
boyfriend
seemed
surprised
and
delighted
by
the
coffee
roasted
chicken
with
the
orange-ricotta
sauce
-LRB-
the
bite
I
had
was
quite
tasty
-RRB-
.
Also
,
I
love
the
fact
that
they
have
live
jazz
on
the
piano
tues-sat
nights
starting
at
6pm
-LRB-
although
tonight
he
started
more
like
6:30
-RRB-
.
It
was
really
nice
.
We
said
that
we
would
definitely
go
another
night
for
drinks
and
appetizers
-LRB-
which
looked
tempting
-RRB-
in
the
bar/lounge
area
with
friends.Louisianne
's
has
seared
it
's
place
inside
of
my
restaurant
experience
.
The
food
is
so
good
,
that
every
time
my
girlfriend
and
I
consider
going
to
any
other
restuarant
,
we
would
have
to
consider
the
huge
opportunity
cost
of
not
going
to
Louisianne
's
.
The
place
is
dungeon-esque
,
but
not
in
a
bad
way
.
It
's
dimly
lit
,
underground
,
but
often
times
has
a
pianist
setting
the
New
Orleans
mood
.
The
food
is
incredible
.
Every
time
we
go
there
we
try
to
get
something
different
,
and
we
're
floored
by
how
good
the
meals
are
,
and
how
much
of
it
you
get
.
The
appetizers
were
delicious
-LRB-
we
've
had
the
platter
for
two
,
and
the
pulled
pork
crepes
-RRB-
,
the
soup
we
've
had
with
our
entrees
were
amazing
each
time
,
with
an
intense
flavor
.
Their
specials
change
every
time
we
've
been
there
,
and
if
they
do
n't
interest
you
,
their
regular
menu
is
always
exceptional
.
We
've
had
the
roasted
shrimp
,
the
tasso
and
shrimp
fettucine
,
the
maple-cured
duck
,
the
steak
,
the
seafood
au
gratin
,
and
each
time
not
only
did
we
get
one
delicious
meal
,
but
enough
to
have
an
amazing
lunch
the
next
day
.
The
only
con
I
can
give
Louisianne
's
is
that
they
give
you
so
much
good
food
that
you
can
never
get
to
the
desserts
.
This
restaurant
is
the
one
that
my
girlfriend
and
I
benchmark
all
other
restaurants
by
,
and
before
we
go
out
to
eat
anywhere
else
,
we
have
to
strongly
consider
the
consequences
of
NOT
going
to
Louisianne
's
.
My
boyfriend
and
I
went
here
on
a
whim
one
night
.
I
was
totally
underwhelmed
.
First
of
all
,
the
service
was
REEEEEALLY
slow
.
from
the
appetizer
on
down
,
everything
took
forever
to
arrive
.
The
lemon
parmesan
artichoke
hearts
were
delicious
!
the
flavors
were
all
perfect
.
That
was
my
favorite
part
of
the
meal
.
My
salad
was
good
.
My
boyfriend
did
n't
like
his
soup
,
so
we
traded
.
The
soup
was
just
okay
.
I
ordered
the
maple
cured
duck
,
and
I
was
surprised
at
how
fatty
and
tough
my
duck
was
.
I
really
had
a
hard
time
eating
it
because
the
texture
in
my
mouth
made
me
kind
of
gag
.
the
veggies
it
came
with
were
good
,
and
the
flavor
of
the
duck
was
good
.
I
'm
not
normally
one
to
order
duck
,
and
I
really
wished
I
did
n't
-LRB-
I
was
torn
about
the
coffee
chicken
.
I
normally
get
chicken
,
but
it
seemed
like
an
odd
combo
of
flavors
-RRB-
.
My
boyfriend
got
the
seafood
au
gratin
which
was
much
better
.
The
best
part
was
that
I
was
so
full
on
bread
by
the
time
my
entree
arrived
that
I
did
n't
feel
like
so
much
of
an
ass
asking
for
most
of
my
meal
to
be
put
in
a
doggie
bag
.
I
'd
be
willing
to
give
this
place
another
chance
though.Met
some
friends
here
for
drinks
at
the
bar
,
which
is
shockingly
small
and
not
suited
for
groups
larger
than
4
.
The
house
wines
are
excellent
.
I
got
the
lemon
artichoke
hearts
-
which
were
awful
,
and
overpriced
.
The
bread
crumbs
were
drenched
in
butter
and
had
a
greasy
feel
to
them
,
and
the
lemon
was
overpowering
.
The
piano
player
did
n't
know
any
of
the
songs
my
friends
or
I
requested
-
and
we
were
n't
making
ridiculous
requests
-
what
piano
player
does
n't
know
Irving
Berlin
?
It
's
a
great
place
to
sit
and
talk
and
drink
wine
,
AFTER
you
've
eaten
somewhere
else.I
saw
Lousianne
's
on
the
news
one
night
.
So
I
took
my
boyfriend
there
for
our
date
night
.
We
were
extremely
underdressed
for
the
occasion
.
A
co-worker
had
told
me
it
was
a
little
fancier
than
casual
but
we
went
totally
casual
anyway
.
Good
news
is
,
it
had
dim
lightening
.
We
had
a
drink
at
the
bar
and
were
quickly
seated
.
I
'm
a
vegetarian
,
so
I
tried
a
pasta
dish
while
my
boyfriend
had
steak
.
We
had
the
goat
cheese
appetizer
,
it
was
better
than
I
expected
.
It
had
a
sauce
to
it
that
had
a
really
unique
taste
to
it
.
The
entrees
were
good
,
I
would
n't
say
the
pasta
was
worth
the
price
and
I
wish
I
would
have
tried
the
vegetarian
jambalaya
.
We
topped
off
the
meal
with
the
White
chocolate
mousse
for
dessert
.
It
was
the
best
part
of
the
whole
meal
,
knocked
my
socks
off
.
I
would
recommend
this
place
,
especially
to
meat
eaters
.
The
service
was
great
,
our
waitress
was
timely
.
She
checked
in
often
and
never
hurried
us
to
finish
and
leave.All
our
friends
had
raved
about
the
food
&
ambiance
,
so
my
wife
&
I
finally
decided
to
try
Louisianne
's
.
The
decor
is
indeed
cozy
-
like
a
nicely
made-up
cellar
.
There
was
plenty
of
room
at
the
bar
so
we
sat
there
before
our
reservation
time
arrived
.
Only
two
beers
on
tap
,
but
both
good
local
brews
from
Capital
.
Eventually
sat
at
our
table
&
perused
the
menu
.
Found
many
appetizers
that
sounded
really
good
-LRB-
including
one
of
the
specials
that
night
-RRB-
so
we
decided
on
sharing
2
apps
and
one
entree
...
seemed
like
a
good
way
to
try
a
few
items
without
getting
too
much
food
.
App
#
1
-LRB-
the
special
-RRB-
:
gnocchi
in
a
savory
cream
sauce
with
crawfish
was
very
tasty
.
Seemed
a
bit
light
in
the
gnocchi
-LRB-
I
think
there
were
5
or
6
-RRB-
but
made
up
for
it
in
sauce
.
Two
thumbs
way
up
.
App
#
2
:
mussels
in
cream
sauce
...
I
had
asked
about
the
size
of
the
mussels
ahead
of
time
and
was
told
they
were
medium
to
large
.
They
were
in
fact
medium
to
small
,
which
was
a
bit
of
a
bummer
because
we
probably
would
have
gone
with
a
different
app
had
we
known
.
But
the
flavors
were
good
&
we
enjoyed
sopping
up
the
sauce
with
the
bread
.
And
the
bread
they
serve
is
quite
good
.
Two
thumbs
up
.
Entree
:
Crawfish
Etouffe
...
I
was
excited
to
try
this
as
I
had
n't
had
etouffe
in
years
.
It
was
n't
bad
,
but
it
was
n't
great
either
.
If
you
went
to
a
friend
's
house
for
dinner
and
they
served
this
you
'd
be
psyched
,
but
at
an
upscale
Cajun
restaurant
for
$
20
you
may
be
left
underwhelmed
.
Two
thumbs
halfway
up
.
The
salad
that
came
with
was
fresh
mesclun
greens
,
with
a
bleu
cheese
dressing
that
was
chunky
but
bland
.
Midway
thru
our
meal
the
jazz
combo
started
up
and
sounded
really
good
-
definitely
added
to
the
atmosphere
.
For
dessert
we
shared
a
slice
of
key
lime
pie
...
nice-tasting
but
no
great
shakes
.
It
seemed
to
be
thickened
with
gelatin
and
I
suppose
I
prefer
mine
to
be
creamier
,
plus
it
was
lacking
in
zing
,
but
only
mildly
.
Again
,
if
your
friend
served
it
you
'd
rightfully
congratulate
them
but
for
$
6.50
it
should
be
REALLY
good
.
Our
server
was
very
nice
&
professional
.
Absolutely
no
complaints
there
.
The
nicest
surprise
came
with
the
bill
-
only
$
70
...
and
that
included
5
drinks
.
We
have
concluded
that
the
next
time
we
go
we
'll
sit
in
the
bar
area
and
have
drinks
&
apps.Crazy
good
food
,
excellent
wine
list
,

waitstaff

Best
atmosphere
for
date
night
!
Not
good
for
kids
.
Make
a
reservation
!!
I
do
n't
care
about
``
ambiance
''
or
``
decor
''
anymore
.
I
hit
40
and
it
does
n't
matter
to
me
anymore
.
I
am
more
concerned
about
food
.
This
food
is
awesome
.
Go
,
it
is
incredible.Good
food
,
I
would
call
it
New
Orleans
inspired
rather
then
real
creole
cooking
.
That
said
I
have
never
had
bad
service
or
bad
food
here
.
It
is
really
nice
setting
for
a
date
or
dinner
out
.
Not
too
spicy
to
scare
the
native
Wisconsin
's
,
including
my
wife.The
raspberry
vinaigrette
salad
dressing
had
actual
raspberries
in
it
.
Ok
.
Just
had
to
get
that
off
my
chest
.
The
dressing
surprised
me
and
I
'll
go
back
for
more
than
just
that
.
We
arrived
on
a
Saturday
night
without
a
reservation
.
I
believe
we
took
one
of
the
last
tables
available
until
9
or
so
.
I
would
have
opted
for
the
bar
if
a
table
had
n't
been
available
.
There
are
a
few
high
top
tables
that
are
seated
in
an
area
with
live
music
.
The
place
is
small
and
intimate
.
It
's
the
perfect
place
for
a
first
date
.
We
started
with
the
Lemon
Parmesan
Artichoke
Hearts
which
were
nothing
like
I
expected
but
were
rich
and
flavorful
.
We
were
n't
terribly
hungry
so
I
ordered
and
appetizer
for
my
entrée
and
my
boyfriend
ordered
the
special
.
I
tried
the
Crawfish
Cheesecake
,
which
,
is
basically
a
cheese
ball
in
the
shape
of
a
piece
of
cheesecake
.
It
was
tasty
and
would
make
the
perfect
appetizer
for
a
table
of
four
but
I
would
n't
recommended
as
a
main
entrée
.
The
special
was
the
highlight
of
the
meal
.
I
could
n't
repeat
it
if
my
life
depended
on
it
,
but
I
heard
the
words
:
scallops
,
shrimp
and
sweet
potato
ravioli
,
pecans
,
lime
something
and
zucchini
...
I
forgot
about
the
rest
of
the
menu
entirely
.
I
'm
not
doing
the
plate
any
justice
with
this
,
but
please
trust
me
,
it
was
delicious
.
The
vegetables
were
perfectly
cooked
with
a
lime
-LRB-
something
,
slightly
spicy
but
still
let
the
veggies
shine
-RRB-
sauce
that
complimented
the
sweet
potato
ravioli
.
Then
there
were
scallops
.
It
was
one
of
those
dishes
that
I
could
n't
comprehend
.
All
I
know
is
I
am
anxious
to
try
more
of
what
this
chef
has
to
offer.Had
a
reservation
at
7:15
pm
but
when
we
arrived
we
were
told
we
needed
to
wait
15
mins
.
That
was
annoying
because
that
defeats
the
purpose
of
making
a
reservation
.
After
that
they
found
us
a
tiny
table
next
to
two
large
tables
.
The
atmosphere
was
loud
and
cramped
.
The
food
however
was
great
.
I
had
the
Bouillabaisse
which
felt
like
something
from
Louisiana
because
it
had
a
thick
earthy
and
spicy
base
.
The
seafood
was
fresh
and
it
came
with
homemade
fettuccine
.
If
the
atmosphere
had
been
better
I
would
make
myself
a
regular.In
case
you
do
n't
know
,
Louisianne
's
has
started
serving
lunch
,
The
good
news
is
that
it
is
inexpensive
and
delicious
.
I
had
a
cup
of
shrimp
bisque
that
was
outstanding
,
and
the
grilled
chicken
po
`
boy
tasted
very
fresh
-LRB-
the
shredded
romaine
lettuce
was
much
appreciated
-RRB-
.
The
only
bad
news
is
the
general
ambience
of
the
upstairs
lunch
area
...
rather
dark
and
uninviting.I
've
been
to
many
restaurants
in
Middleton
,
but
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
,
and
for
a
number
of
reasons
.
The
food
was
excellent
:
I
had
a
scallop
and
shrimp
special
.
The
service
was
excellent
:
Seated
promptly
,
waitress
prompt
,
professional
and
spoke
very
clearly
when
it
came
to
the
specials
.
The
atmosphere
is
unique
:
In
the
basement
of
a
building
,
but
you
would
n't
think
so
when
you
're
there
.
Piano
player
,
Great
Martini
!
So
when
you
're
in
Middleton
,
I
suggest
you
stop
here
!
-LRB-
And
Marnie
is
correct
on
the
raspberry
vinaigrette
dressing
with
actual
raspberries
in
it
!!
-RRB-
Think
upscale
semi-authentic
Luisiana
with
a
romantic
jazz
overtone
.
The
food
is
really
quite
great
,
and
I
would
never
pass
up
the
catfish
.
It
was
blackened
and
served
with
a
sauce
that
was
indescribable
.
For
a
starter
I
got
the
stuffed
mushrooms
with
tasty
craw
fish
filling
.
For
desert
...
yeah
that
was
n't
going
to
happen
I
was
stuffed
!
The
total
bill
for
me
was
$
37
,
which
was
reasonable
considering
the
quality
,
ambience
and
how
friendly
the
service
was
.
The
only
missing
star
was
that
we
had
trouble
finding
our
server
as
we
were
trying
to
pay
our
bill
-LRB-
it
had
already
been
dropped
off
but
then
he
was
gone
!
-RRB-
Yelpers
,
you
let
me
down
!
I
was
on
my
business
trip
to
WI
,
and
i
was
very
excited
about
trying
this
restaurant
!
boy
,
it
was
a
huge
disappointment
.
have
crab
puff
pastry
as
appetizer
.
this
was
pretty
decent
dish
.
the
puff
pasty
came
out
flaky
,
just
how
it
should
be
.
i
could
taste
the
crab
flavor
and
almond
crisps
.
it
was
very
delicious
.
I
also
ordered
the
lobster
bisque
.
bisque
was
on
the
salty
side
,
but
it
was
ok
with
the
bread
.
i
wish
i
could
have
stopped
my
meal
here
...
Everyone
on
yelp
was
raving
about
their
raspberry
sauce
on
the
house
salad
.
so
i
ordered
that
just
to
try
the
raspberry
dressing
,
and
huge
disappointment
.
it
came
with
this
layer
of
oil
,
and
not
enough
``
sauce
''
.
when
i
poured
onto
my
salad
it
was
just
drenched
in
oil
.
i
did
n't
even
eat
the
salad
.
I
had
the
steak
special
of
the
night
and
it
was
not
good
at
all
!
the
meat
was
over
cooked
charred
-LRB-
i
like
my
meat
medium
rare
-RRB-
,
the
rice
was
undercooked
,
it
was
crunch
,
and
the
sauce
was
not
good
at
all
,
it
did
not
compliment
the
dish
.
i
only
ate
the
shrimp
.
it
was
$
35
dish
i
only
picked
shrimp
from
it
The
service
was
soooooo
slow
that
night
.
usually
i
enjoy
my
meals
like
these
but
that
night
i
wanted
just
GET
OUT
OF
THERE
!
the
server
took
forever
to
bring
out
my
dishes
and
i
was
getting
really
impatient
.
for
the
amount
of
time
at
was
at
the
table
,
she
did
n't
come
by
to
check
up
on
me
when
i
needed
anything
.
ugh
.
never
again.Was
visiting
Madison
for
Epic
Training
last
year
and
came
here
with
some
coworkers
.
AWESOME
!!
Everything
I
had
was
delicious
.
Tried
escargot
for
the
first
time
and
it
was
wonderful
.
It
was
drenched
in
some
savory
buttery
sauce
and
topped
with
a
puff
pastry
...
OMG
.
We
also
tried
the
crab
puffs
,
they
were
also
delicious
.
Ca
n't
remember
exactly
what
my
entree
was
but
it
had
bacon
in
it
and
was
great
too
.
The
chocolate
creme
brulee
was
lovely
.
Back
in
Madison
this
week
and
will
be
going
here
tomorrow.We
met
another
couple
here
for
dinner
.
Love
the
ambiance
,
the
smell
,
the
courtesy
of
the
staff
.
It
's
all
good
.
But
the
food
was
especially
excellent
.
I
ordered
the
Pecan
Catfish
.
Wow
!!!
It
was
baked
to
perfection
with
darkened
spices
making
it
the
perfect
spiciness
!!!
I
loved
it
!
Veggies
were
fresh
and
crisp
.
We
had
an
excellent
Pinot
Grigio
off
the
list
.
The
others
ordered
tenderloin
cordon
bleu
,
which
was
raved
about
.
There
was
a
shrimp
and
pork
loins
special
.
That
got
thumbs
up
and
then
another
shrimp
dish
that
came
on
a
bed
of
fresh
spinach
,
which
I
think
she
wished
she
had
rice
or
pasta
instead
,
but
she
did
like
it
.
Love
coming
here
and
always
recommend
it
to
friends!Went
again
and
it
was
AMAZING
as
usual
.
Went
with
a
group
of
coworkers
and
we
started
out
with
escargot
,
crab
puffs
and
stuffed
mushrooms
...
YUM
For
the
entree
's
I
had
some
pork
masterpiece
that
was
a
featured
dish
and
it
was
divine
.
For
dessert
I
believe
I
had
the
dark
chocolate
creme
brulee
again
.
It
was
another
great
experience!If
you
like
spicy
drinks
,
try
the
Cajun
Martini
.
Lots
of
nice
offerings
in
this
cozy
place
,
but
Cajun/Creole
cuisine
is
their
forte
,
especially
the
seafood
.
Romantic
,
subterranean
dining
room
unlike
anything
else
you
'll
find
in
Madison
.
Hard
to
believe
you
're
in
beautiful
downtown
Middleton.if
you
're
looking
for
a
nice
night
out
,
keep
looking
...
Be
careful
as
you
enter
this
place
,
the
steps
are
steep
as
you
are
going
in
the
basement
.
Also
,
the
carpet
on
the
steps
is
very
dirty
,
makes
you
wonder
what
the
kitchen
looks
like
.
Four
of
us
had
dinner
and
overall
the
food
is
good
.
Service
a
little
slow
but
very
friendly
.
The
place
is
cramped
and
the
music
was
loud
,
so
it
was
difficult
to
have
a
conversation
at
the
table
.
For
the
price
of
the
meal
you
can
do
much
better
than
this
restaurant.Awesome
food
.
Definitely
a
good
place
to
eat
if
it
is
your
first
time
in
Madison
,
WI.After
hearing
great
reviews
of
Louisianne
's
,
my
husband
and
I
decided
to
give
it
a
try
.
We
went
for
appetizers
and
drinks
rather
than
a
full
meal
.
We
sat
at
the
bar
and
had
excellent
service
by
the
bartender
.
When
we
first
arrived
it
was
n't
very
crowded
,
but
after
10
minutes
the
bar
was
packed
with
people
.
The
atmosphere
was
cozy
and
very
welcoming
with
the
live
piano
music
.
We
had
the
``
combination
for
2
''
-LRB-
crab
puffs
,
barbecue
shrimp
,
and
stuffed
mushrooms
-RRB-
and
an
order
of
the
mussels
for
a
total
of
$
20
.
The
mussels
were
filling
since
they
are
in
a
cream
sauce
and
served
with
yummy
bread
.
The
combination
plate
was
also
excellent
.
We
were
pleasantly
full
and
enjoyed
a
nice
bottle
of
wine
for
around
$
55
.
It
is
nice
to
see
a
high
quality
restaurant
in
Middleton
!
We
will
definitely
be
back
again!My
Experience
at
Louisianne
's
was
JUST
OK
.
I
have
heard
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
this
place
so
I
gave
it
a
try
.
I
went
on
a
Friday
night
by
myself
and
Sat
at
the
Bar
.
Not
really
the
type
of
place
you
can
sit
at
the
bar
.
It
's
very
small
,
there
is
no
television
,
and
hardly
any
stools
.
They
have
live
music
on
the
weekends
so
the
place
was
very
loud
.
My
Bartender
was
the
only
one
behind
the
bar
and
the
restaurant
was
pretty
busy
.
So
,
as
you
can
imagine
my
service
was
slow
.
I
had
the
crab
puff
pastry
and
BBQ
Shrimp
as
an
appetizer
.
The
Crab
Pastry
was
very
good
.
The
BBQ
Shrimp
however
were
not
.
I
was
surprised
they
left
the
shell
on
the
shrimp
when
they
serve
it
.
For
my
main
entree
I
had
the
Coffee
Crusted
Chicken
and
a
half
order
of
jambalaya
.
They
would
n't
let
me
have
jambalaya
as
a
side
so
I
had
to
order
half
a
plate
of
it
If
i
wanted
to
try
it
.
The
Chicken
was
very
moist
and
flavorful
.
A
lot
sweeter
than
I
had
anticipated
but
good
.
The
jambalaya
was
very
disappointing
.
Overall
,
I
would
say
it
was
just
ok.We
decided
to
sit
at
the
bar
and
have
our
dinner
there
so
we
could
listen
to
the
piano
player
.
We
waited
a
very
long
time
to
place
a
drink
order
,
while
watching
the
bartender
stand
and
converse
with
other
patrons
.
Then
,
it
was
an
even
longer
wait
to
order
dinner
.
-LRB-
empty
tables
all
over
,
so
it
was
n't
due
to
being
busy
-RRB-
We
were
n't
sure
who
was
supposed
to
be
taking
care
of
us
,
the
bartender
or
a
waitress
.
The
bartender
took
our
drink
order
after
a
long
wait
,
and
then
after
that
,
finally
a
waitress
came
by
as
asked
,
``
I
guess
you
want
to
hear
our
specials
?
''
She
took
our
order
and
we
never
saw
her
again
.
Water
came
half
way
through
our
meal
from
the
bartender
.
Our
empty
plates
sat
on
our
table
for
25
minutes
.
We
felt
very
unattended
to
and
almost
a
bother
to
the
staff
.
The
food
is
excellent
,
however
,
and
that
just
makes
it
tolerable
to
go
there
.
It
is
not
an
inexpensive
place
to
eat
,
and
it
feels
like
a
place
where
you
should
have
excellent
service
.
I
got
tired
of
trying
to
flag
someone
down
all
evening.Best
place
in
the
world
,
I
cant
endorse
this
shit
enough
.
Best
meal
is
as
follows
-LRB-
although
ive
had
other
things
here
,
all
good
,
nothing
touches
this
one
-RRB-
App
:
Crawfish
cheesecake
,
sounds
weird
but
is
best
of
Wisconsin
and
Louisiana
at
once
.
Cheese
and
crawfish
.
Done
.
Entree
:
Their
special
filet
,
basically
take
everything
that
is
great
and
put
it
on
a
filet
.
Nothing
more
to
say
.
Goat
cheese
and
sun
dried
tomatoes
makes
this
.
Desert
:
Chocolate
creme
brulee
,
exactly
as
it
sounds
,
would
choke
a
homeless
person
for
this
-LRB-
wont
be
missed
-RRB-
.
Live
music
also
sometimes.The
moment
you
walk
in
you
are
transported
into
another
time
and
place
.
They
had
live
music
that
fit
the
scene
,
made
the
atmosphere
,
and
stayed
background
enough
to
have
a
conversation
-
check
it
out
Tuesdays
through
Saturdays
.
Order
the
pecan
catfish
with
the
crawfish
BBQ
on
top
,
aka
``
Maria
's
special
''
.
It
sounds
wacky
but
the
pecans
really
go
with
the
blackened
catfish
.
The
tasso
and
shrimp
fettuccine
-
a
combination
of
shrimp
,
smoked
ham
,
and
mustard
cream
sauce
sounds
like
a
questionable
combination
but
it
is
soothing
,
hot
soul
food
at
its
fanciest
.
Everything
we
ate
had
depth
,
richness
,
and
finesse
.
If
you
are
a
soup
snob
,
definitely
get
the
soup
over
the
salad
option
.
Presentation
was
lacking
but
I
do
n't
think
that
's
the
point
of
soul
food
.
Service
is
sassy
but
whole-hearted
.
We
walked
in
without
reservations
at
7pm
on
a
Friday
and
when
we
asked
if
we
could
sit
at
the
bar
we
were
told
``
yeah
,
if
you
can
find
seats
''
.
We
found
a
couple
stools
and
ordered
dinner
at
the
bar
.
It
is
n't
bend
over
backwards
service
,
but
they
are
real
people
and
sometimes
that
's
better
.
Maria
,
our
bartender
who
's
worked
there
13
years
,
gave
excellent
food
and
drink
recs
and
was
really
attentive
despite
the
rush
-
she
basically
made
our
night
.
It
's
a
great
place
to
bring
guests
if
you
want
to
head
off
to
a
chill
and
unexpected
place
.
Even
better
if
you
're
prepared
to
stuff
your
faces
with
well-executed
comfort
food
.
Try
the
Sazerac
if
you
want
a
stiff
,
sweet
drink
and
the
Hurricane
if
you
want
a
fruity
,
refreshing
beverage
that
punches
like
a
Long
Island
.
The
crowd
here
is
mature
and
casually
well-dressed
.
We
had
a
wonderful
experience
at
Louisianne
's
.
We
had
reservations
for
dinner
,
but
happened
to
be
seated
next
to
a
rather
loud
group
of
men
.
Since
the
restaurant
was
completely
full
,
we
asked
if
we
might
be
able
to
be
seated
in
the
bar
area
instead
-LRB-
which
was
much
quieter
-RRB-
.
They
quickly
accomodated
our
request
and
we
had
an
enjoyable
conversation
throughout
dinner
.
The
food
was
excellent
and
a
musician
softly
played
piano
in
the
background
.
The
service
was
prompt
,
helpful
,
and
friendly
.
Terrific
night
out!Quiet
,
quaint
and
awesome
.
The
place
is
tucked
away
and
underground
.
Piano
man
in
the
bar
area
playing
jazz
and
lounge
tunes
.
Had
escargot
,
wine
and
barracuda
.
At
how
many
other
places
can
you
say
you
have
all
of
those
at
once
,
AND
underground
.
Zero
!
This
place
is
good
.
Priced
well
for
what
you
get
too
.
Could
n't
finish
it
all.Good
food
but
not
authentic
and
quite
overpriced
.
$
38
for
1
entree
and
1
dessert
served
by
a
snotty
teenager
?
Really?Wow
!
What
a
find
!
Outside
of
the
worn
carpet
on
the
stairs
on
the
way
down
,
this
place
is
pretty
awesome
.
Very
quaint
,
very
,
very
quaint
as
you
are
literally
underground
.
I
loved
the
feel
of
the
place
and
the
atmosphere
.
The
food
did
not
disappointment
either
.
The
escargot
were
absolutely
perfect
,
perfect
,
one
of
the
best
I
have
yet
to
have
and
I
have
had
them
in
many
different
place
.
For
my
entree
I
went
with
the
Crayfish
etoufee
and
I
am
glad
I
did
.
Excellent
roux
,
plenty
of
crayfish
,
perfectly
cooked
rice
.
Excellent
overall
.
I
would
give
it
5
starts
but
the
dessert
menu
is
very
,
very
pedestrian
and
not
inspired
.
Would
go
back
again
though
and
again.Emeril
Lagasse
would
have
been
disappointed
.
There
was
no
Bam
!
during
our
visit
to
Louisianne
's
on
9/10/13
.
The
good
:
my
wife
's
company
,
the
wine
list
,
the
evening
's
piano
player
,
the
salad
,
and
the
crawfish
corn
chowder
.
The
bad
:
the
thick
,
yellow
,
and
salty
cream
sauce
our
mussels
swam
in
and
the
worn
out
carpet
on
the
stairs
leading
down
to
the
restaurant
.
The
ugly
:
The
not
so
special
blackened
swordfish
entrée
with
salty
sides
and
the
shrimp
etouffee
.
The
classic
Cajun
dish
was
a
generous
amount
of
white
rice
with
salty
ketchup
sauce
.
:
-
-LRB-
Steps
are
a
bit
hard
for
us
oldies
but
the
food
made
up
for
it
.
Three
of
us
,
our
son
has
been
there
before
,
thought
mom
and
dad
should
too
.
.
Started
with
mussels
,
and
crab
puffs
,
both
were
so
good
,
we
went
through
three
baskets
of
bread
with
them
.
The
raspberry
dressing
on
salad
was
a
bit
tart
,
my
only
complaint
,
and
one
had
soup.I
had
the
duck
,
which
was
super
good
,
one
had
the
seafood
au
gratin
,
and
one
etouffee
...
we
were
all
pleased
and
all
took
home
left
overs
...
...
We
split
a
piece
of
the
peanut
butter
pie
...
and
one
had
coffee
.
.
we
had
a
fun
time
drove
70
miles
to
get
there.We
enjoyed
our
visit
to
this
restaurant
however
the
waitress
makes
or
breaks
the
evening
.
More
on
that
later
.
We
started
at
the
bar
and
the
bar
tender
was
super
cool
.
He
made
a
fantastic
Sazerac
,
one
of
the
oldest
cocktails
in
the
USA
.
The
four
of
us
admired
the
decor
of
the
establishment
in
addition
to
the
fun
columns
throughout
that
separated
the
patrons
making
it
a
more
private
experience
.
This
place
is
in
a
basement
and
the
columns
separate
everyone
,
different
than
all
the
open
air
structures
these
days
.
We
had
reservations
and
were
seated
about
10
minutes
late
however
we
were
flexible
.
The
waitress
was
not
very
friendly
and
did
not
smile
.
She
was
making
the
motions
.
Likely
tired
because
it
was
Badger
Homecoming
Saturday
and
they
were
busy
.
We
were
celebrating
a
birthday
and
asked
if
they
did
anything
special
.
She
said
I
do
n't
know
and
can
check
.
When
she
came
back
she
said
if
you
buy
a
desert
,
we
can
put
a
candle
in
it
.
What
??
What
restaurant
does
not
do
something
for
a
birthday
.
Oh
well
,
move
on
...
Each
of
us
DID
enjoy
our
meal
.
We
had
the
Crawfish
Cheesecake
for
appetizer
.
It
was
like
a
cheesecake
?
Different
and
good
.
Two
of
us
ordered
separate
specials
and
the
other
two
ordered
items
off
the
menu
.
None
of
us
could
finish
and
we
enjoyed
leftovers
the
next
day
.
The
food
was
rich
and
heavy
,
comfort
food
like
.
If
you
are
on
a
diet
you
'd
need
to
be
selective
because
no
calories
are
spared
here
.
In
summary
a
happy
waitress
and
a
little
birthday
treat
and
this
place
would
be
through
the
roof!Stopped
in
for
a
drink
on
Monday
night
.
A
few
observations
:
Drinks
:
My
martini
and
cosmopolitans
were
delicious
.
S.
really
enjoyed
his
whisky
sour
.
Drinks
were
very
good
.
Food
:
For
an
appetizer
,
we
ordered
the
crab
cakes
.
I
had
the
Pecan-Encrusted
Catfish
and
the
seafood
bisque
,
and
S.
had
the
pork
entree
and
the
pork
and
sweet
potato
soup
.
We
were
both
very
impressed
.
I
do
n't
even
eat
meat
,
but
I
tried
S.
's
pork
entree
and
it
was
A
M
A
Z
I
N
G.
And
I
ca
n't
say
enough
good
things
about
the
catfish
.
I
was
so
glad
to
have
some
left
over
,
which
I
ate
cold
the
next
morning
!
Service
:
Our
server
was
so
,
so
wonderful
.
I
wish
I
could
remember
his
name
.
Young
guy
,
dark
hair
,
thin
.
He
recommended
essentially
all
of
our
food
to
us
,
and
we
were
happy
with
all
of
it
.
The
bartender
also
came
by
and
checked
to
make
sure
I
liked
my
cosmo
-LRB-
I
was
n't
sure
I
'd
like
it
-RRB-
.
She
was
quite
friendly
.
Will
definitely
go
back
the
next
time
we
are
in
Madison.Fun
,
warm
,
lively
catacomb
place
,
often
with
piano
music
.
Food
is
always
really
good
.
I
want
to
hang
out
here
more.I
've
brought
business
contacts
and
executives
from
my
firm
to
Louisiannes
'
.
Always
they
have
been
impressed
with
the
quality
of
the
food
,
the
ambiance
of
the
facility
and
the
attentiveness
of
the
staff
.
It
compares
well
with
top
quality
restaurants
all
over
the
world.Dined
here
recently
with
friends
,
and
had
an
enjoyable
experience
,
but
not
so
great
food
.
The
pros
:
Inviting
and
cozy
atmosphere
.
Really
friendly
and
attentive
service
.
Excellent
live
music
.
Great
cocktails
,
ok
wine
list
.
The
cons
:
The
food
was
boring
and
inconsistent
.
We
had
the
artichoke
hearts
,
crab
puffs
,
and
escargots
for
appetizers
.
I
did
n't
get
the
sense
that
the
seafood
was
fresh
.
Rather
it
was
definitely
of
the
frozen
variety
.
And
everything
was
made
with
frozen
puff
pastry
.
Even
the
escargot
were
covered
with
puff
pastry
.
I
think
it
was
to
cover
for
the
frozen
seafood
?
Anyway
,
the
appetizers
reminded
me
of
Pinterest
recipes
.
A
big
red
flag
for
me
is
when
there
are
too
many
components
in
a
dish
.
That
usually
means
that
the
ingredients
are
n't
good
enough
to
stand
out
on
their
own
or
the
chef
does
n't
know
how
to
edit
.
I
think
we
experienced
a
little
of
both
.
My
husband
and
I
both
got
the
special
.
It
was
a
blackened
pork
tenderloin
with
shrimp
accompanied
by
mushrooms
in
a
sherry
sauce
with
red
potatoes
.
Each
component
sounded
good
.
However
,
the
presentation
and
preparation
was
a
train
wreck
.
The
tenderloin
came
on
skewers
.
What
?
The
shrimp
were
over
cooked
.
The
meat
and
shrimp
were
served
in
a
jumble
of
quartered
red
potatoes
and
mushrooms
.
Everything
was
covered
in
some
sort
of
Cajun
seasoning
that
was
reminiscent
of
Durkee
or
McCormick
.
Then
it
was
all
topped
with
some
sort
of
cornstarch
thickened
sherry
sauce
.
The
whole
thing
tasted
like
it
was
straight
off
the
Sysco
truck
and
reheated
.
One
of
our
companions
ordered
the
filet
.
She
let
us
have
a
taste
,
and
the
steak
was
good
.
But
it
came
with
a
buerre
blanc
dipping
sauce
.
I
'm
not
sure
what
chef
would
pair
buerre
blanc
with
steak
to
begin
with
,
but
just
like
my
meal
,
it
was
clear
that
the
buerre
blanc
was
another
corn
starch
imposter
.
Dessert
was
a
dark
chocolate
creme
brûlée
.
It
was
dry
and
pedestrian
.
Really
I
think
this
place
deserves
2.5
stars
,
but
Yelp
does
n't
do
half
stars
,
so
I
'll
be
generous
.
Lousiannes
clearly
has
a
loyal
customer
base
and
is
a
popular
place
.
I
would
definitely
go
back
for
the
cocktails
and
even
the
appetizers
because
the
price
point
was
n't
outrageous
for
all
the
puff
pastry
and
I
could
still
enjoy
them
now
that
I
know
what
to
expect
.
But
I
would
not
return
for
dinner
.
If
I
'm
going
to
spend
$
30
for
an
entree
,
I
expect
fresh
ingredients
,
sauces
made
to
order
,
and
a
chef
that
knows
how
to
cook
.
Madison
has
too
many
restaurants
that
offer
far
superior
food
to
Lousiannes
,
and
that
's
what
will
drive
my
future
dining
decisions.Just
ok
because
my
bar
for
New
Orleans
food
is
quite
insurmountable
!
But
I
give
honest
reviews
.
Whoever
is
in
the
kitchen
can
season
food
like
nobody
's
business
!
It
is
great
food
.
Seafood
was
not
fresh
though
and
they
really
do
not
have
Bread
Pudding
on
the
menu
!
That
tells
me
that
the
chef
is
not
from
Louisiana
at
all
.
Prices
are
too
high
,
way
to
high
!
Jambalaya
for
$
20
!
Ridiculous
really
.
A
pot
of
that
for
10
people
cost
$
20
.
But
if
you
want
great
atmosphere
and
good
food
that
is
just
seasoned
well
,
go
.
Drinks
are
reasonable
and
service
is
fantastic.We
went
here
for
my
sister
in
law
's
birthday
.
I
was
anxious
because
my
last
time
here
was
so
unappealing
,
but
this
time
was
a
whole
different
story
!
We
ordered
four
appetizers
to
split
and
all
of
them
were
delicious
.
I
had
a
steak
which
was
cooked
to
perfection
.
The
service
was
excellent
.
The
wine
they
recommended
was
delicious
.
We
split
several
desserts
and
they
were
delicious
as
well
.
I
'm
still
on
the
fence
about
the
place
but
our
last
time
there
was
good
enough
that
I
will
give
it
another
chance
to
make
my
final
decision.My
husband
and
I
went
to
Louisianne
's
recently
after
we
sold
our
condo
and
got
a
Middleton
Chamber
of
Commerce
gift
certificate
from
our
real
estate
agent
-LRB-
Leslie
Blum
,
she
's
great
!
-RRB-
.
We
wanted
to
use
the
opportunity
to
have
a
special
date
night
and
go
somewhere
a
bit
more
upscale
than
we
usually
do
.
Having
never
been
to
Louisianne
's
in
the
5
years
that
I
've
lived
in
Middleton
,
I
suggested
we
try
it
out
.
I
give
the
atmosphere
of
this
place
a
solid
five
stars
.
Although
it
has
an
rather
bland
looking
storefront
,
the
inside
of
the
restaurant
is
anything
but
.
You
walk
into
Louisianne
's
and
immediately
head
downstairs
.
It
's
all
stone
and
looks
like
you
're
walking
into
a
cool
cave
or
something
.
It
's
dark
,
but
there
's
a
lot
of
ambiance
.
I
've
been
to
New
Orleans
,
and
it
definitely
has
that
sort
of
vibe
to
it
.
It
's
romantic
,
fun
,
and
not
what
you
'd
expect
from
the
outside
.
I
felt
like
we
were
on
vacation
while
we
were
there
.
Also
,
there
was
a
live
jazz
band
playing
and
they
were
really
rocking
.
It
was
awesome
!
We
went
at
about
8pm
on
a
Friday
night
had
to
wait
about
ten
minutes
for
a
table
,
which
was
fine
.
While
we
waited
,
we
ordered
drinks
at
the
bar
and
watched
the
band
.
I
had
red
wine
,
and
my
husband
had
Jameson
on
the
rocks
.
We
were
seated
and
ordered
the
Pecan
Crab
Cakes
as
an
appetizer
.
They
were
good
,
probably
just
3
stars
though
,
as
they
tasted
a
lot
like
other
Midwestern
crab
cakes
that
I
've
had
before
.
They
were
heavy
on
bread
and
light
on
crab
...
with
a
lot
of
Old
Bay
seasoning
.
Again
,
they
were
n't
bad
at
all
,
but
not
spectacular
.
Next
,
we
ordered
some
more
wine
and
our
entrees
-LRB-
more
on
those
in
a
minute
-RRB-
.
We
were
given
a
choice
of
soup
or
salad
with
our
entrees
and
we
each
ordered
soup
.
They
had
two
soups
of
the
day
:
a
shrimp
-
corn
chowder
-LRB-
which
I
got
-RRB-
,
and
a
tomato-based
pulled
pork
stew
that
was
like
chilli
-LRB-
which
my
husband
had
-RRB-
.
Both
soups
were
fantastic
!
Definitely
5
stars
for
the
soup
.
I
'll
take
a
minute
here
to
comment
that
I
enjoy
going
to
traditional
restaurants
from
time
to
time
,
places
where
soup/salad
and
bread
are
included
with
your
meal
instead
of
everything
being
ala-cart
.
-LRB-
It
reminds
me
of
dining
in
Wisconsin
supper
clubs
as
a
child
-RRB-
.
By
the
way
,
the
bread
basket
was
delicious
and
was
quickly
replenished
by
the
waitress
after
we
ate
all
of
the
bread
within
30
seconds
of
sitting
down
because
it
was
warm
and
toasty
-LRB-
and
served
with
soft
butter
-RRB-
and
we
were
starving
!
Onto
the
entrees
!
My
husband
absolutely
LOVED
his
dish
.
He
claims
that
it
was
possibly
``
the
best
thing
I
've
ever
had
in
a
restaurant
''
.
He
chose
the
Coffee
Roasted
Chicken
,
which
featured
a
bed
of
-LRB-
homemade
-RRB-
fettuccine
topped
with
a
coffee-crusted
bone-in
grilled
chicken
breast
,
in
a
``
hazelnut
,
orange
,
ricotta
sauce
''
.
I
think
there
was
spinach
in
it
too
.
The
pasta
was
perfectly
al
dente
,
the
grilled
chicken
moist
,
and
the
sauce
was
rich
and
creamy
.
It
almost
reminded
me
of
a
Thai
peanut
sauce
,
but
with
hazelnuts
instead
.
Although
it
sounded
like
something
that
could
become
cloyingly
sweet
,
it
was
not
.
It
had
a
nice
subtle
umami
essence
in
addition
to
the
sweetness
.
Delicious
.
5
stars
.
The
reason
that
Louisianne
's
is
not
getting
a
five
star
review
from
me
,
however
,
is
due
to
my
entree
,
which
I
felt
was
very
underwhelming
.
We
do
n't
eat
pasta
at
home
for
health
reasons
,
so
I
usually
get
it
when
we
go
somewhere
nice
as
a
special
treat
.
I
chose
the
tasso
and
shrimp
fettuccine
because
it
was
homemade
pasta
,
and
because
it
featured
authentic
New
Orleans
style
ingredients
-LRB-
for
the
unfamiliar
,
tasso
is
basically
spicy
ham
-RRB-
.
The
shrimp
and
tasso
pieces
in
my
pasta
were
well-cooked
,
but
they
were
sparse
.
The
dish
also
featured
mushrooms
,
and
they
were
fabulous
...
probably
the
best
part
.
However
,
the
pasta
was
supposed
to
have
a
``
Creole
mustard
cream
sauce
''
,
and
it
did
n't
really
.
The
sauce
was
very
light
,
and
had
little
flavor
.
It
was
kind
of
sad
,
because
I
was
really
hoping
to
be
wowed
and
I
was
n't
.
I
'd
say
my
item
was
probably
3
stars
,
and
would
have
been
awesome
if
only
the
sauce
had
been
a
bit
more
pronounced
and
flavorful
.
The
service
was
adequate
.
Nothing
remarkable
in
either
a
good
or
a
bad
way
.
Summary
:
I
'd
definitely
return
.
I
think
Lousianne
's
Etc.
is
a
decently
nice
restaurant
overall
,
and
is
great
for
special
occasions
.
Their
primary
issue
,
from
both
my
own
experience
as
well
as
the
reviews
on
Yelp
,
seems
to
be
consistency
.
Some
menu
items
are
fabulous
,
and
others
are
meh
.
The
major
problem
with
this
is
that
Louisianne
's
menu
is
at
a
price
point
where
people
only
go
occasionally
...
so
the
restaurant
basically
has
one
shot
to
impress
,
and
if
they
fail
at
that
,
guests
wo
n't
return
for
a
second
chance
.
I
think
this
explains
why
the
Yelp
reviews
for
Louisianne
's
are
so
polarized.Came
here
based
upon
Yelp
reviews
.
I
was
expecting
a
dive
place
,
like
all
the
other
cajun
places
I
've
been
to
,
but
that
's
not
this
place
.
Dark
mood
lighting
in
the
basement
of
an
old
house
.
Small
menu
and
very
pricey
.
Not
what
I
was
expecting
at
all
.
I
ordered
the
blackened
catfish
and
a
beer
.
The
catfish
and
the
jambalaya
were
the
two
least
expensive
entrees
in
the
low
$
20
's
per
each
.
Pleasantly
surprised
by
the
large
portion
of
grilled
vegies
and
handmade
mashed
potatoes
that
came
with
the
catfish
.
Amazing
flavor
and
worth
the
money
.
The
menu
did
n't
mention
the
sides
included
.
Friend
ordered
the
jambalaya
and
let
me
try
it
.
The
blackened
catfish
was
way
better.I
love
this
place
.
I
love
the
ambiance
,
the
food
,
and
the
drinks
.
It
's
even
better
when
they
have
a
lounge
singer
in
the
background.I
order
it
for
my
employees
occasionally
.
The
pizza
is
what
you
expect
,
nothing
better
than
OK
.
They
throw
on
an
extra
$
1.50
for
delivery
charge
and
the
drivers
tell
us
that
most
goes
directly
to
the
managers
pockets
.
That
Sucks.Gross
!
I
generally
love
Papa
Johns
,
but
this
one
is
lacking
in
all
areas
.
I
ordered
PJs
for
lunch
and
once
it
finally
arrived
-LRB-
1
hour
later
-RRB-
,
it
was
luke
warm
and
soggy
.
Apart
from
that
,
the
staff
lacks
any
work
ethic
or
customer
service
.
The
three
people
I
dealt
with
were
all
rude
and
careless
.
Initially
,
they
ended
up
giving
me
a
$
5
credit
.
Ha
!
As
if
I
would
order
again
anyway.A
5
star
gem
!
I
echo
Jenny
D
's
comment
on
the
hash
brown
.
Super
crispy
exterior
and
moist
fluffy
inside
-
it
's
a
piece
of
art
.
My
friend
and
I
enjoyed
the
generous
portion
of
scramble
egg
-LRB-
$
7.50
-RRB-
,
and
2
layers
blueberry
pancake
-LRB-
$
5.00
-RRB-
.
Everything
tasted
like
``
mom
's
food
.
''
Made
fresh
to
order
,
and
very
satisfying
.
No
frou-frou
typical
Middleton
gimmick
.
The
basic
decore
,
and
the
down
to
earth
service
-
the
perfect
spot
to
watch
regulars
enjoy
the
hearty
breakfast.Delicious
!
Great
service
,
good
prices
and
tasty
food
.
Echo
what
previous
posts
say
about
the
hashbrowns
!
Breakfast
burrito
is
really
good
and
giganticThree
Sisters
is
one
of
the
best
breakfast
joints
in
the
Madison
area
.
For
me
the
two
best
things
are
the
hash
browns
and
the
omelettes
.
Like
all
the
other
raters
,
I
think
their
hash
browns
are
perfect
.
Their
omelettes
are
not
the
fluffy
kind
.
They
are
flat-cooked
,
sheet-style
,
folded
around
all
the
good
stuff
you
specify
.
This
is
the
kind
of
omelette
I
prefer
,
and
for
this
style
theirs
is
one
of
the
best
I
've
had
.
Beyond
that
,
the
service
is
super
unpretentious
and
friendly
.
Their
cinnamon
rolls
are
big
,
soft
,
and
without
the
density
I
favor
.
Their
pancakes
are
more
spongy
than
I
like
.
But
you
should
still
try
them
,
it
's
just
a
matter
of
style
,
and
everything
here
is
done
with
sincerity
and
consistency
.
You
will
find
something
you
like
enough
to
keep
going
back
,
especially
since
their
prices
are
so
reasonable.In
our
opinion
Three
Sisters
will
appeal
to
certain
people
and
not
to
others
.
Some
will
like
it
's
laid
back
,
small
town
,
dinette
atmosphere
.
Nothing
fancy
,
good
food
,
large
portions
.
Others
will
also
enjoy
the
good
food
but
will
be
displeased
with
the
lack
of
space
,
mismatched
dinning
wear
,
less
than
average
coffee
,
barely
toasted
toast
and
the
``
greasy
spoon
''
environment
of
the
building
.
Some
will
see
4
or
five
stars
,
go
there
and
say
``
dead
on
.
Loved
the
place
.
''
Others
will
wonder
how
someone
gave
them
more
than
three
.
We
went
back
and
did
n't
enjoy
our
food
as
much
as
we
did
the
last
time
and
the
coffee
was
not
very
good
.
Also
we
thought
the
prices
were
higher
.
Anyway
,
love
it
or
leave
it
,
it
is
a
three
star
restaurant
in
our
book
.2.5
breakfast
spot
,
i
gave
three
because
of
the
service
.
The
breakfast
is
kinda
greasy/oily
,
which
i
usually
like
,
but
this
was
a
bit
much
though
...
I
would
rate
this
place
higher
if
they
lowered
the
prices
and
moved
people
thru
like
a
diner
should.Nice
place
for
a
Sunday
morning
cozy
breakfast
.
No
frills
,
just
good
food
simply
made
.
Pancakes
are
huge
and
delicious
.
They
have
build
your
own
omelets
and
egg
beaters
are
available
by
request
.
Oatmeal
was
very
good
.
My
whole
breakfast
was
$
11
.
One
funny
thing
is
that
it
seemed
like
they
only
have
six
menus
for
the
whole
restaurant
.
We
had
four
in
our
party
and
had
to
wait
for
a
table
of
six
to
order
before
we
could
get
a
menu
.
Overall
I
liked
the
simple
atmosphere
cheap
prices
and
good
food.Great
coffee
and
some
of
the
best
eggs
I
've
ever
had
.
It
's
sort
of
a
hole
in
the
wall
,
but
that
adds
to
the
ambiance
.
Super
nice
wait
staff
,
too.Had
breakfast
at
Three
Sisters
a
few
days
ago
while
at
Middleton
for
a
meeting
.
Very
``
down
home
''
place
.
Mexican
flavorful
dishes
along
with
midwest-country
favorites
.
I
had
some
eggs
and
the
Mexican
hash
browns
.
Great
way
to
start
the
morning
.
Friendly
staff
knew
the
customers
and
welcomed
new-comers
.
Patrons
here
ranged
from
seniors
in
high
school
to
senior
citizens
.
Very
congenial.I
had
one
of
the
best
breakfasts
I
have
ever
had
here
!
This
must
be
a
Wisconsin
thing
,
but
their
scramble
-LRB-
eggs
with
various
other
ingredients-like
an
omelet
by
scrambled
eggs
-RRB-
was
delish
.
I
noticed
the
scramble
at
other
places
too
.
I
had
the
Denver
scramble
,
which
had
the
perfect
amount
of
cheese
on
top
.
The
hashbrowns
were
pretty
good
too
.
I
also
had
one
pancake
.
Very
good
.
The
staff
were
all
very
chatty
and
engaging
everyone
in
conversation
.
Service
was
fast
.
After
reading
a
few
reviews
on
Yelp
,
I
guess
I
was
expecting
a
little
larger
restaurant
,
but
this
is
in
a
small
place
,
basically
a
diner
.
FYI
,
they
are
closed
on
Monday
,
I
heard
them
tell
someone
.100
%
traditional
all-american
diner
breakfast
experience
.
I
like
trying
new
breakfast
spots
with
my
kids
but
this
place
remains
a
favorite
.
Friendly
,
chatty
waitresses
who
dote
on
the
kids
like
they
were
their
own
grandkids
.
Inexpensive
.
Oatmeal
for
when
you
want
to
eat
somewhat
healthy
-LRB-
this
place
ai
n't
for
health
food
...
-RRB-
Omelet
was
good
,
probably
because
it
tasted
like
it
was
cooked
in
butter
...
Good
pancakes
.
Take
your
check
to
the
counter
/
bar
when
you
want
to
pay
.
Cash
only.Cobb
salad
was
large
and
had
great
cheeses
,
meats
and
veges
.
I
tried
the
onion
rings
which
had
a
slightly
sweet
batter
.
It
really
perked
up
the
onion
flavor
.
Worth
the
money.
,
breakfast
or
lunch
.
Oh
,
I
was
warned
to
only
order
a
stack
of
pancakes
and
...
if
I
'd
like
,
half
orders
are
also
acceptable
.
Next
visit
is
breakfast
to
use
the
advice.I
was
so
disappointed
after
reading
all
of
the
reviews
.
Firstly
,
breakfast
stops
at
11:00
on
weekdays
and
noon
on
the
weekends
,
NOTE
THAT
because
when
we
showed
up
today
after
my
husbands
late
night
shift
the
night
before
they
would
not
serve
us
breakfast
.
CASH
OR
CHECK
ONLY
Worth
noting
,
both
menus
are
pretty
slim
,
but
breakfast
is
larger
than
lunch
.
They
were
out
of
the
fried
chicken
``
dinner
''
-LRB-
you
mean
lunch
,
since
they
were
only
open
till

We
ended
up
ordering
the
patty
melt
,
ok
,
fish
sandwich
,
subpar
,
and
onion
rings
,
good
but
not
$
3
good
.
Sandwiches
come
with
chips
,
not
fries
.
But
was
definitely
not
the
pancakes
that
everyone
else
was
raving
about
that
I
was
craving
.
The
coffee
was
sting
but
a
bit
bitter
.
The
total
was
just
under
$
20
without
tip
.
The
decor
is
old
,
does
n't
bother
me
too
much
,
but
looking
at
the
filthy
carpets
,
it
was
disgusting
and
I
was
a
bit
afraid
since
I
was
wearing
flat
sandals
.
Before
I
forget
to
mention
it
,
the
place
smells
like
smoke
when
you
first
walk
in
,
I
was
completely
expecting
to
see
ashtrays
at
the
booths
.
The
service
was
excellent
...
If
you
are
a
regular
.
If
not
,
plan
on
spending
about
three
times
too
much
there
.
We
waited
for
about
5
minutes
for
our
waitress
-LRB-
one
of
the
owners
-RRB-
to
shout
sit
where
you
want
.
We
grabbed
a
table
.
My
husband
had
to
take
a
work
call
,
but
had
given
me
his
order
.
After
waiting
10
minutes
,
I
had
to
flag
our
waitress
down
to
place
our
orders
,
and
she
looked
at
me
shocked
that
I
would
want
something
to
eat
.
Trying
to
get
the
check
out
of
her
was
terrible
.
By
12:15
the
lunch
regulars
had
started
coming
in
,
so
she
was
chatting
about
a
recent
wedding
,
showings
hem
the
wedding
pictures
,
talking
about
what
the
place
looked
like
,
etc.
by
12:30
I
had
out
cash
on
the
end
of
the
table
hoping
to
move
things
along
.
She
walked
past
us
three
times
without
making
eye
contact
,
finally
,
I
put
my
arm
out
and
asked
for
the
check
,
which
had
not
been
prepared
,
wait
for
another
5
minutes
while
she
served
more
regulars
and
FINALLY
she
got
back
to
using
we
were
out
of
there
by
12:50
.
In
short
,
we
will
never
return
.
It
is
expensive
for
what
you
get
,
food
is
unremarkable
,
serve
is
terrible
,
and
it
seemed
like
it
could
use
a
food
service
inspection
because
it
was
pretty
dirty.I
visited
this
time
for
breakfast
on
the
weekend
.
Holy
cats
is
it
ever
so
busy
.
I
tried
the
2,2,2,2
meal
.
.
2
eggs
,
2
bacon
,
2
sausage
,
2
pancakes
-
I
chose
blueberry
.
The
pancakes
had
great
flavor
and
the
berries
where
awesome
-
very
fresh
.
We
also
tried
the
corned
beef
hash
.
It
's
just
hashbrowns
with
corned
beef
chunks
and
large
onion
slices
.
It
's
ok
,
just
not
as
good
as
Pancake
Cafe
's
.
I
will
be
back
to
try
their
biscuits
and
gravy
-LRB-
it
sold
out
.
.
sounds
like
a
winner
-RRB-
and
their
mexican
hashbrowns.It
is
as
good
as
all
the
reviews
say
!
It
is
a
nice
little
diner
with
great
service
.
I
was
greated
immediately
upon
entering
.
I
sat
down
and
was
asked
right
away
what
I
wanted
to
drink
.
The
coffee
was
hot
and
fresh
.
I
had
the
2,2,2,2
and
it
was
very
good
.
Served
hot
off
the
grill
.
I
will
be
back
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
to
try.This
is
a
great
place
to
go
for
a
good
,
cheap
breakfast
that
will
fill
you
up
.
You
seat
yourself
,
but
the
staff
is
still
at
your
table
taking
your
drink
orders
quickly
.
The
staff
is
always
super
friendly
and
all
of
the
breakfast
items
I
've
tried
have
been
great
.
Even
better
,
they
keep
your
coffee
filled
even
when
it
's
busy
!
:--RRB-
Only
thing
to
know
ahead
of
time
is
they
only
accept
cash
and
there
is
no
atm
in
the
restaurant.I
love
this
place
!
It
's

owned

The
scene
reminds
me
of
...
a
garage
.
A
garage
with
fairly
rude
servers
and
overstuffed
patrons
with
nothing
to
say
.
We
waited
...
And
waited
.
The
menu
had
the
basics
-
no
problem
there
.
We
waited
.
Oh
,
everything
is
made
to
order
that
is
why
it
takes
so
long
...
Seriously
that
is
what
we
were
told
.
Other
reviewers
say
``
it
is
like
their
mothers
used
to
make
''
.
Sorry
to
hear
your
mom
was
a
lousy
cook
.
And
she
must
've
been
a
grouch
.
Yes
the
food
is
pretty
bad
.
Why
people
go
here
I
ca
n't
understand
.
I
gave
it
three
visits
before
passing
judgement
.
The
verdict
-
AVOID.If
your
looking
for
Bar
food
in
the
city
of
Middleton
this
is
the
place
to
go
.
They
have
excellent
burgers
.
And
honestly
their
fries
are
some
of
the
best
I
have
had
.
Ive
been
there
only
twice
and
have
never
had
anything
else
on
the
menu
other
than
the
cheeseburger
but
it
was
excellent
as
far
as
burgers
go
.
My
friend
got
the
cheese
steak
...
which
looked
awesome
too
.
Worth
checking
out
if
your
looking
for
a
burger/sandwich
...
and
prices
are
quite
good.Quick
review
:
Stopped
in
for
lunch
today
,
with
the
intention
of
sampling
their
Friday
Fish
special
.
$
7
gets
you
2
pieces
of
deep
fried
cod
,
fries
,
slaw
,
roll
,
and
soda
.
Fish
was
solid
-
nicely
done
,
especially
for
the
price
and
speed
.
Detailed
review
:
I
'd
never
visited
the
Middleton
Sport
Bowl
prior
to
today
,
so
I
was
n't
quite
sure
what
to
expect
.
We
arrived
exactly
at
noon
,
parked
,
and
made
our
way
to
the
bar
,
where
we
found
two
seats
and
were
promptly
greeted
by
a
bartender
.
We
both
ordered
the
lunch
special
-
2
piece
deep
fried
cod
plate
with
fries
,
slaw
,
tartar
,
dinner
roll
,
and
soda
.
The
bartender
took
our
order
and
came
back
with
a
complimentary
bowl
of
popcorn
,
which
was
a
nice
surprise
.
Plates
arrived
about
10
minutes
later
-
the
fish
was
appropriately
sized
,
as
were
the
fries
-
no
imbalance
,
and
portions
were
fair
.
The
fish
itself
had
a
flavorful
beer
batter
that
was
a
little
thicker
than
what
you
'll
typically
find
at
most
places
,
but
it
was
delicious
and
I
welcomed
the
extra
crunch
.
Inside
,
the
fish
itself
was
a
tad
watery
with
just
a
hint
of
grease
-
not
anything
outrageous
,
but
just
enough
to
sense
that
it
was
there
.
Flavor
of
the
fish
was
incredibly
mild
;
the
batter
stole
some
of
its
thunder
.
The
fries
were
excellent
-
battered-style
and
straight
cut
.
I
'm
told
the
slaw
and
tartar
were
``
average
.
''
Dinner
roll
was
hard
and
dry
.
Total
lunch
bill
for
two
:
$
14.64
,
and
we
were
in-and-out
within
35
minutes
.
Totally
acceptable
and
a
good
lunch
,
all
things
considered
.

Summary
:
Not
a
win
,
nor
a

.
I
'd
go
back
for
the
fish
at
lunch
,
and
will
definitely
be
back
to
sample
other
foods
-
the
sandwiches
looked
really
good.Middleton
Sport
Bowl
is
kind
of
a
mixed
bag
.
I
'll
briefly
break
down
how
I
gauge
them
-LRB-
I
've
been
many
times
,
both
before
and
after
the
renovation
-RRB-
Facility
:
Great
environment
,
a
reasonable
number
of
lanes
-LRB-
although
not
as
many
as
other
alleys
in
the
area
-RRB-
,
a
roomy
bar
with
TVs
for
the
sports
games
,
and
an
upstairs
that
has
both
pool
as
well
as
a
rental
area
that
hosts
private
functions
or
tournaments
.
Cost
:
Fairly
cheap
if
you
go
on
open
bowling
nights
,
I
think
it
's
around
$
1
or
$
2
a
game
plus
shoes
.
I
'm
sure
it
's
hiked
up
otherwise
.
Open
Bowling
is
usually
after
9pm
during
the
week
and
not
a
bad
option
.
We
used
to
go
on
Thursdays
which
seems
to
be
a
good
night
for
them
.
Food
:
It
's
typical
bar
food
.
They
have
good
cheese
curds
,
and
the
usual
fare
that
you
'd
see
at
an
alley
.
Nothing
to
write
home
about
but
if
you
're
in
the
mood
for
a
greasy
burger
you
probably
wo
n't
go
wrong
.
Service
:
I
can
not
stand
the
people
that
work
at
the
counter
.
There
's
a
couple
of
older
guys
-LRB-
50-60
+
-RRB-
who
obviously
hate
life
and
want
to
project
that
on
you
when
you
're
there
.
Everytime
I
've
gone
in
I
've
tried
to
be
courteous
and
polite
,
and
asked
simple
basic
questions
like
``
I
'd
like
to
get
a
lane
,
there
's
3
of
us
and
we
all
need
shoes
''
etc
,
etc.
.
These
guys
first
look
at
you
like
you
walked
into
the
wrong
bar
,
and
then
respond
with
gruff
,
2
second
answers
that
does
n't
help
either
party
move
the
process
along
.
It
's
really
irritating
because
I
've
gone
to
this
alley
off
and
on
for
probably
about
10
years
or
so
,
and
it
's
always
been
like
that
.
The
bartenders
,
when
you
get
a
woman
,
are
usually
friendly
and
do
n't
share
the
same
attitude
.
Personally
I
'm
more
of
a
Schwoeglers
guy
,
but
their
prices
for
open
bowling
are
more
expensive
and
the
atmosphere
is
noiser
,
so
Sport
Bowl
sometimes
wins
out.Hadn
'
t
been
to
the
SportBowl
for
quite
some
time
,
but
visited
for
lunch
today
,
thanks
to
a
hot-tip
about
the
burgers
and
curds
.
Some
co-workers
had
been
raving
about
them
,
and
ever
the
skeptic
,
I
had
to
verify
the
claims
for
myself
.
Arrived
at
around
noon
on
a
Friday
,
and
copped-a-squat
at
one
of
the
numerous
bar
stools
.
A
very
friendly
bartender
walked
over
,
menu
in
hand
,
and
asked
what
I
'd
like
to
drink
.
I
ordered
an
iced
tea
,
and
browsed
the
menu
.
Tea
arrived
within
a
minute
,
and
I
placed
my
order
:
cheese
curds
and
a
bacon
cheeseburger
,
with
pepper
jack
,
cooked
medium
,
please
.
The
bartender
left
with
my
order
,
and
I
passed
the
time
by
watching
the
Big-10
basketball
tournament
and
gazing
around
at
the
large
and
expansive
bar
area
.
The
food
arrived
,
and
it
looked
spectacular
.
Let
's
start
with
the
curds
.
Friends
,
I
know
curds
.
Believe
me
.
You
can
read
all
you
want
about
the
``
awwwesome
''
and
``
amaaaaaazing
''
curds
from
the
Old
Fashioned
-
those
suck
.
Point
blank
-
they
suck
.
They
're
greasy
,
they
're
usually
over-cooked
,
and
they
're
bland
.
What
``
saves
''
the
OF
's
curds
is
their
tiger
sauce
.
And
I
do
n't
care
who
you
are
,
but
to
borrow
from
another
reviewer
,
``
Sauce
does
not
a
good
curd
make
''
-LRB-
sorry
Doctress
,
I
saw
your
line
in
the
El
Tigre
review
,
and
had
to
borrow
it
-RRB-
.
The
Sport
Bowl
's
curds
are
DEFINITELY
homemade
.
You
can
tell
simply
by
looking
at
them
that
these
offerings
begin
as
simple
,
unbreaded
curds
,
are
battered
and
rolled
in
a
breading
-LRB-
probably
Cornflake
or
cracker
?
-RRB-
,
and
then
carefully
deep-fried
.
And
the
result
speaks
for
itself
.
They
are
EXCELLENT
.
So
good
-LRB-
see
photo
-RRB-
.
The
bartender
confirmed
they
take
`
bare
'
curds
,
and
give
'em
the
batter/breading
treatment
,
all
to
order
.
I
believe
him
.
You
need
to
believe
me
-
these
are
the
best
curds
you
'll
find
outside
of
Green
County
.
The
burger
was
equally
excellent
,
and
I
'm
going
to
go
on
record
to
say
the
burgers
here
are
without
a
doubt
in
the
Top
3
for
Madison-area
burgers
.
Knoche
's
Market
supplies
the
beef
.
It
's
hand-pattied
and
grilled
to
perfection
.
I
asked
for
medium
and
received
a
true
medium
burger
.
The
burger
was
n't
dry
and
it
was
n't
greasy
.
It
had
a
delicious
smokey
,
charcoaled
flavor
that
instantly
brought
back
memories
of
mid-summer
grill-nights
back
home
...
The
pepperjack
had
a
nice
kick
,
and
the
bacon
served
as
pork-icing
on
the
cow
cake
-LRB-
I
'd
have
said
`
beef
cake
'
but
that
's
a
bit
over-the-top
-RRB-
.
The
bun
was
light
and
airy
-
very
fresh
tasting
and
lightly
toasted
.
The
burger
was
so
good
that
I
'd
have
no
problem
eating
it
completely
plain
-
burger
and
bun
alone
.
That
's
saying
something
.

with
all
50
+
people
who
had
just
come
back
on
the
Badger
Bus
,
there
were
only
2
servers
,
and
they
were
also
the
bartenders
!
Service
was
slow
,
haphazard
,
and
careless
--
the
guy
never
once
asked
how
the
food
was
,
nor
did
he
ever
actually
stop
at
the
table
except
long
enough
to
take
our
order
.
Drinks
were
dropped
on
the
fly
,
the
food
was
all
but
thrown
as
he
whizzed
by
...
Overall
,
2
stars
.
I
'll
go
back
for
the
Badger
Bus
and
the
bowling
,
but
I
will
NEVER
eat
there
again.Like
to
stop
here
on
Fridays
,
as
your
first
drink
is
free
.
That
's
right
not
2
for
1
,
free
!
Had
a
burger
on
last
visit
which
was
quite
possibly
the
best
I
have
ever
had
!

Service
OK.I
eat
lunch
here
about
3
times
a
week
.
They
have
a
different
special
each
day
of
the
week
Monday
through
Friday
.
Always
friendly
!
I
would
definitely
recommend
if
you
are
looking
for
a
place
to
eat
some
lunch.A
co-worker
of
ours
just
got
a
promotion/transfer
,
and
as
part
of
his
farewell/send-off
,
he
requested
we
join
him
for
lunch
at
the
Sport
Bowl
.
I
ca
n't
expand
much
from
my
previous
review
-LRB-
s
-RRB-
...
the
burgers
are
still
in
the
Top
3
for
Madison
,
the
curds
are
in
the
Top
2
.
This
is
primarily
a
burger/fries/curds
place
;
everyone
in
our
party
ordered
burgers
-LRB-
save
for
me
and
my
boss
-
we
both
ordered
salads
-RRB-
,
and
every
burger
was
perfectly
cooked
and
earned
rave
reviews
.
The
salads
are
n't
anything
special
;
processed
meats
,
iceberg
lettuce
,
mediocre
veggies
.
I
would
've
loved
to
have
one
of
those
succulent
burgers
,
but
I
'm
in
the
zone
with
my
diet/exercise
these
days
.
Lunch
specials
include
a
free
soda/iced
tea
as
well.I
'm
not
reviewing
this
place
as
a
bowling
alley
,
since
I
do
n't
have
the
expertise
to
know
what
constitutes
a
good
bowling
experience
.
If
the
shoes
fit
,
the
ball
rolls
down
the
lane
,
and
the
pins
fall
down
,
it
's
fine
.
This
review
is
all
about
the
food
.
Which
,
if
you
ca
n't
tell
by
the
number
of
stars
above
these
paragraphs
,
is
pretty
tasty
.
To
start
,
the
cheese
curds
are
required
eating
.
I
think
they
just
take
cheddar
cheese
cubes
,
bread
them
,
and
fry
them
,
but
they
are
delicious
when
fresh
.
Make
sure
to
eat
them
quick
,
however
,
because
,
like
all
cheese
curds
,
they
harden
when
they
cool
and
have
a
weird
texture
after
that
point
.
When
you
think
bar
food
,
you
think
burgers
.
And
the
burgers
at
the
Sport
Bowl
are
excellent
.
Not
only
are
they
excellent
,
they
are
fairly
priced
as
well
.
At
lunch
,
you
can
get
a
burger
+
fries
-LRB-
battered
!
-RRB-
+
soda
for
eight
bucks
.
I
can
see
some
people
thinking
the
burgers
are
too
greasy
,
but
the
grease
gives
you
a
delightful
``
contented
,
weighed
down
,
and
fuzzy-brained
''
feeling
afterwards
.
A
quick
rundown
on
other
items
I
've
tried
:
the
meatball
sub
was
so-so
,
but
huge
.
Go
to
Gino
's
a
mile
away
if
you
're
craving
meatballs
.
The
turkey
club
is
stacked
high
and
tastes
exactly
as
you
would
expect
.
The
patty
melt
is
just
a
burger
on
bread
,
so
obviously
it
rules
hard
.
The
pizza
is
decent
,
with
a
crust
that
tastes
like
Pizza
Hut
's
deep
dish
.
The
fish
fry
is
a
lot
of
good
food
for
a
good
price
.
The
``
Philly
''
cheesesteak
is
too
greasy
even
for
me
.
The
best
part
about
the
Sport
Bowl
is
that
if
you
feel
some
postprandial
guilt
for
your
frenzied
ingestion
of
large
amounts
of
fat
and
grease
,
you
can
pop
over
to
Willy
West
next
door
to
get
an
organic
hippie-smoothie
.
But
it
will
probably
cost
more
than
your
entire
meal
here.Great
burgers
,
sad
fish
.
We
do
a
weekly
managers
meeting
and
everyone
takes
turns
choosing
the
location
.
One
of
the
guys
choose
the
Madison
Sports
Bowl
.
I
ordered
the
fish
,
when
the
food
came
to
the
table
I
saw
beautiful
hand
pattied
burgers
,
hand
dipped
onion
rings
,
then
came
my
fish
.
Sad
flat
,
boring
,
breading
right
off
the
Sysco
truck
.
What
a
disappointment
.
Today
we
made
a
second
trip
and
I
ordered
the
burger
and
onion
rings
.
I
'm
very
happy!Ever
since
their
renovation
,
this
place
has
knocked
it
out
of
the
park
.
This
is
THE
place
to
go
for
a
cold
beer
after
a
softball
game
.
Hungry
?
No
problem
!
Their
menu
is
extensive
and
everything
that
I
've
had
has
been
excellent
.
I
especially
recommend
the
pizza
-
you
do
n't
expect
great
pizza
from
a
bowling
alley
,
but
they
do
a
great
job
.
It
's
a
favorite
of
ours
.
Their
burgers
are
top
notch
as
well
.
I
have
n't
had
the
gyros
,
but
a
friend
of
mine
raves
about
them
.
The
kids
menu
is
great
-
my
little
guy
destroyed
their
mini
corn
dogs
.
The
staff
is
very
friendly
and
helpful
.
The
owners
put
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
time
into
this
place
,
and
it
shows
.
On
a
cool
summer
evening
,
you
ca
n't
beat
sitting
out
on
the
patio
with
a
cold
one.One
of
our
first
restaurant
visits
when
we
moved
here
.
We
have
since
learned
to
avoid
any
restaurant
a
local
recommends
.
Menu
was
full
of
bland
comfort
food
.
Wife
had
chicken
and
dumplings
that
tasted
like
they
came
out
of
a
can
My
steak
was
tough
and
flavorless
.
Restaurant
has
been
in
the
same
location
for
about
100
years
and
it
shows
,
it
's
badly
in
need
of
a
remodel
.
Entire
place
smelled
like
vomit
and
was
dirty
.
I
could
smell
the
bathrooms
ten
feet
away
and
when
I
had
to
visit
they
were
even
worse
,
layer
over
layer
of
dirt
.
Where
's
the
health
inspector
.
Service
was
extremely
poor
,
especially
considering
we
were
the
only
people
in
the
place
.
I
guess
the
highschooler
that
was
serving
us
was
too
busy
talking
on
her
cell
phone
to
help
us.Used
to
be
a
classic
.
However
,
it
's
come
under
new
ownership
and
everything
has
suffered
across
the
board
.
Average
service
,
below
average
food
and
terrible
atmosphere
.
Needs
a
shot
in
the
arm
because
it
'd
be
a
shame
to
see
a
classic
Wisconsin
supper
club
disappear.I
wanted
to
like
it
,
I
really
did
.
The
Stamm
House
is
walking
distance
from
home
,
so
I
figured
we
HAD
to
try
it
...
First
off
,
let
me
say
that
the
atmosphere
is
typical
old
-LRB-
emphasis
on
the
old
-RRB-
-
school
Wisconsin
restaurant
.
Wood
paneling
,
dated
tables
and
chairs
,
and
GOD
AWFUL
seventies
music
piped
in
.
When
we
walked
in
-LRB-
at
six
on
a
Saturday
night
-RRB-
there
was
one
couple
at
the
bar
,
and
another
couple
dining
upstairs
near
us
.
The
waiter
seated
us
--
close
to
the
kitchen
,
I
realized
with
disappointment
.
If
I
want
to
hear
dishes
clanging
and
the
hustle
and
bustle
,
I
'd
be
cooking
at
home
.
Dining
out
is
for
pretending
that
there
's
no
work
involved
.
It
also
did
n't
help
that
because
it
was
so
slow
in
the
restaurant
,
I
could
hear
every
comment
the
waiter
said
to
the
cook-staff
,
some
of
which
was
n't
patron-friendly
.
The
BF
ordered
the
fried
walleye
,
and
I
the
beef
tips
Moutarde
.
His
french
onion
soup
was
decent
,
but
my
salad
was
lacking
.
When
the
meal
arrived
,
I
was
so
excited
because
I
was
STARVED
.
I
picked
up
a
piece
of
beef
with
my
fork
and
bit
down
into
tender
,
juicy
...
FAT
.
Fatty
fatty
fatness
.
Ewww
.
I
did
the
not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate
maneuver
.
All
right
.
Every
now
and
then
you
get
a
fatty
piece
of
meat
in
a
dish
.
A
girl
can
move
on
.
MY
next
bite
was
better
,
and
although
the
sauce
was
decent
,
it
was
nothing
fabulous
.
I
was
disappointed
when
my
next
piece
was
also
quite
fatty
.
You
know
when
you
get
that
cheap
meat
that
is
mostly
sinew
and
fat
.
*
Sigh
*
I
'm
done
.
I
pushed
the
dish
off
to
the
side
and
settled
for
my
potato
.
To
give
credit
,
the
waiter
noticed
I
was
n't
eating
the
dish
,
and
asked
me
if
something
was
wrong
.
I
told
him
,
and
he
offered
to
get
me
something
else
,
which
I
declined
-LRB-
by
the
time
it
was
made
,
Chris
would
have
been
done
with
his
dish
-RRB-
.
Later
,
he
also
offered
a
free
dessert
,
which
we
really
did
n't
want
.
He
ended
up
knocking
almost
half
off
my
dish
,
which
was
appropriate
,
I
think
.
Over
all
,
it
just
was
n't
enjoyable
.
I
could
have
gotten
over
picking
a
bad
dish
if
the
experience
itself
was
nice
,
but
it
was
n't
.
Average
at
best
.
The
waiter
was
decent
and
tried
to
be
accommodating
,
but
on
the
whole
,
it
was
just
sub-par
.
I
left
wishing
that
I
had
picked
another
spot
to
spend
my
hard
earned
date-night
budget
!
I
realize
that
a
place
like
this
is
n't
going
to
be
gourmet
,
but
I
've
had
MUCH
better
casual
dining
experiences
...
for
less
money
!
2-stars
may
be
a
bit
generous
if
we
're
just
measuring
food
quality
.
Quick-n-dirty
review
:
Stamm
House
features
a
lot
of
character
,
history
,
and
good
service
.
Unfortunately
,
that
's
about
all
it
has
to
offer
,
unless
you
enjoy
food
that
is
extremely
greasy
,
and
of
mediocre
quality
.
Detailed
review
:
Our
fish
fry
crew
decided
to
give
Stamm
House
a
try
after
we
'd
read
good
things
about
it
on
a
fairly
well
known
fish
fry
review
website
.
Normally
,
those
guys
-LRB-
the
reviewers
-RRB-
are
pretty
spot
on
,
but
they
've
completely
missed
the
mark
when
it
comes
to
the
Stamm
House
.
Not
even
close
to
being
a
top-10
place
,
no
way
,
no
how
.
We
sauntered
in
to
the
Stamm
House
at
around
5:45
on
Friday
night
and
were
shocked
to
find
the
place
darned-near
empty
.
The
bartender
greeted
us
immediately
-
very
friendly
guy
-
we
ordered
a
couple
of
New
Glarus
Nakeds
and
a
Spotted
Cow
.
After
downing
the
first
round
,
we
went
to
order
a
refill
,
and
whoops
-
Naked
went
empty
,
and
there
was
n't
any
more
left
.
Drat
.
After
downing
a
second
round
of
beers
-LRB-
Cows
all
around
this
time
-RRB-
,
it
dawned
on
us
that
we
probably
needed
to
inquire
about
a
table
.
So
,
we
wandered
upstairs
where
a
friendly
lady
told
us
she
'd
have
an
opening
at
around
6:45
or
7:00
.
Odd
,
the
place
was
empty
...
but
,
we
took
it
and
went
back
downstairs
.
We
ordered
some
cheese
curds
and
the
onion
rings
.
The
bartender
warned
us
ahead
of
time
that
the
curds
were
``
standard-from-the-bag
''
curds
,
but
said
the
rings
were
hand-battered
and
delicious
.
They
arrived
quickly
,
and
once
again
,
the
bartender
was
spot-on
with
his
description
.
The
curds
were
Sysco
curds
and
were
not
cooked
well
at
all
.
I
do
n't
think
the
fryer
was
hot
enough
,
because
these
curds
were
drenched
in
grease
-
so
much
so
that
we
could
n't
eat
them
.
Disgusting
.
And
the
ranch
dipping
sauce
was
like
water
...
you
know
what
they
say
about
oil
and
water
...
The
rings
were
decent
,
but
again
-
the
grease
was
ridiculous
.
It
really
made
for
a
bad
first
impression
.
So
,
we
ordered
some
Whiskey
Old
Fashioned
Sours
to
help
cut
through
the
grease
film
that
was
sitting
so
heavily
on
our
palettes
.
Our
table
was
ready
by
7:00
-
ish
,
and
much
to
our
surprise
,
when
we
went
upstairs
this
time
,
the
place
was
packed
.
Where
those
people
came
from
,
and
how
they
got
up
there
without
us
noticing
remains
a
mystery
...
our
waitress
stopped
promptly
,
checked
our
drinks
,
and
took
our
order
-
fried
perch
all
the
way
around
with
hash
browns
on
the
side
.
Dinner
salads
came
first
and
were
nice
;
fairly
fresh
,
fairly
tasty
,
and
just
the
right
size
.
Fish
came
out
slightly
later
-
served
family
style
-
along
with
our
hash
browns
.
First
bite
of
the
fish
?
UGH
-
it
tasted
awful
.
Extremely
fishy
flavor
-LRB-
and
I
love
fish
-RRB-
.
Think
``
stinky
NJ
ocean
shore
line
flavor
''
-
not
delicate
,
flavorful
,
flaky
,
and
enjoyable
.
No
sir
,
this
was
the
nightmarishly
bad
fish
that
we
all
remember
from
our
grade
school
days
-
you
know
,
the
stuff
that
was
about
2-3
days
away
from
being
used
as
feed
for
the
sea
lions
at
the
zoo
So
,
we
doused
it
with
lemon
and
gave
it
another
go
-
and
once
again
,
the
fish
was
so
overpoweringly
fishy
that
we
reached
for
the
-LRB-
gasp
!
-RRB-
ketchup
.
That
helped
a
bit
,
but
it
still
was
n't
an
enjoyable
fish
fry
.
The
fish
was
cooked
well
-
not
too
greasy
,
and
it
was
breaded
rather
than
battered
.
If
only
it
were
n't
so
obscenely
fishy
...
Hash
browns
were
tasty
-
fried
nicely
-LRB-
crisp
and
tasty
-RRB-
.
Service
was
fantastic
-
our
waitress
was
fun
,
helpful
,
and
did
a
great
job
of
checking
in
with
us
.
Total
bill
for
three
with
a
round
or
two
of
drinks
was
$
45-ish
.

me
start
right
out
by
saying
that
this

nothing
to

Some

you

's
hard
to
keep
a
150-year
old
lady
going
in
style
-RRB-
.
So
we
came
to
DRINK
and
PLAY
,
in
other
words
,
on
a
busy
Friday
night
,
in
spite
of
,
or
because
of
,
the
fish
fry
.
We
grabbed
some
stools
but
found
ourselves
giving
up
our
seats
to
some
lovely
ladies
who
were
waiting
to
be
seated
for
the
fish
fry
.
-LRB-
Like
I
said
,
we
were
n't
here
for
the
food
,
but
I
got
ta
wonder
why
the
fish
fry
was
JAM
PACKED
CONSTANTLY
.
-RRB-
After
bugging
the
extremely
convivial
bartender
about
the
history
of
the
place
,
and
begging
to
see
the
``
wine
cellar
''
/
slave-holding-tank
in
the
basement
,
he
tossed
his
apron
at
someone
and
announced
an
impromptu
``
tour
''
.
WOW
!
It
was
cool
to
say
the
least
,
imagining
the
terrified
slaves
packed
into
the
``
secret
''
cellar
,
with
its
curved
brick
walls
.
So
we
took
turns
squeezing
in
and
out
,
then
returned
to
the
bar
and
proceeded
to
enjoy
tons
of
conversation
with
the
locals
.
So
,
I
'm
a
fan!Overall
it
was
a
nice
supper
club
.
You
have
the
bar
area
then
you
go
upstairs
to
eat
.
Drinks
were
good
.
The
fish
was
good
.
I
would
have
liked
to
see
a
baked
option
on
the
fish
fry
.
The
family
style
all
you
can
eat
was
good
.
French
fries
were
good
too
-LRB-
all
you
can
eat
-RRB-
.
Not
the
best
fish
I
have
ever
had
,
but
above
average
.
The
place
was
quite
so
you
could
talk
without
yelling
which
was
nice.FYI
-
this
place
is
closed
.
It
is
for
sale
.4
stars
for
Hardee
's
?!?
It
's
no
Culver
's
by
a
long
shot
but
that
Thick
Burger
was
damn
tasty
!
I
do
n't
know
if
the
restaurant
was
clean
but
the
drive
thru
service
was
good.I
like
this
place
because
it
usually
is
n't
very
crowded
.
There
's
a
Culver
's
down
the
street
that
always
has
about
five
times
the
business
as
this
place
.
The
burgers
are
really
good
,
the
best
fast-food
burgers
in
my
opinion
-LRB-
yes
,
better
than
Culvers
,
gasp
-RRB-
,
and
the
fries
are
excellent
as
well
.
The
best
part
is
that
if
you
get
there
at
any
time
other
than
lunchtime
,
you
get
fresh
fries
.
The
only
thing
I
do
n't
like
is
how
they
put
mayo
on
some
of
their
burgers
,
but
they
never
have
a
problem
with
making
one
without
mayo
.
Service
is
always
friendly
,
but
sometimes
a
little
slow
.
Oh
yeah
,
you
should
also
stay
away
from
the
chicken
strips
.
They
're
bad
.
The
decor
here
is
awesome
,
with
wood
paneling
straight
out
of
the
80
's
and
cheap
plastic
booths
.
There
's
even
a
sterile-looking
wall
clock
on
one
of
the
walls
.
If
you
want
to
reminisce
about
a
time
before
fast-food
restaurants
tried
to
be
all
trendy
and
hip
,
you
should
stop
in
at
Hardee
's
.
The
Middleton
Hardee
's
just
renovated
.
They
got
rid
of
the
wood
paneling
and
switched
to
a
trendy
red/black
color
scheme
.
It
is
much
more
pleasing
to
the
eye
,
but
I
was
still
sad
when
I
found
out
.
Now
I
go
to
Perkin
's
for
my
old-person
decor
fix
.
Thankfully
,
the
outside
of
the
restaurant
still
looks
like
your
typical
run-down
fast
food
eatery
!
Also
,
the
new
fresh-fried
chicken
strips
they
've
introduced
are
orders
of
magnitude
better
than
the
old
ones
,
which
tasted
like
they
had
been
fried
in
a
factory
,
frozen
,
and
then
microwaved
for
five
seconds
before
being
served
.
Nothing
in
fast
food
is
ever
fresh
,
but
these
new
chicken
strips
do
a
passable
impersonation
of
it.Okay
,
my
review
sums
it
all
up
in
a
text
that
I
sent
to
my
boyfriend
several
hours
after
eating
a
Frisco
Burger
w/o
tomato
,
small
order
of
curly
fries
and
a
small
diet
coke
.

Some
part
of
me
recognizes
that
the
Village
Green
might
be
a
bit
of
a
hole
in
the
wall
,
but
I
've
been
going
there
since
before
I
could
walk
so
I
have
to
love
it
.
It
's
where
``
the
locals
''
go
for
a
burger
and
cheese
curds
.
Whether
you
graduated
from
MHS
in
2004
or
in
1969
,
you
'll
probably
run
into
someone
you
know
from
high
school
.
I
love
this
place
because
it
has
n't
changed
a
bit
-
the
food
is
still
awesome
,
they
still
do
n't
take
credit
cards
,
and
they
still
play
nothing
but
football
on
the
big
screen
tv
up
front.Wandered
in
to
the
Village
Green
after
a
hard
day
at
the
office
.
Sat
at
the
bar
,
quizzed
the
bartender
about
a
few
things
and
ultimately
tried
a
bunch
of
the
``
specialties
.
''
Service
?
Top
notch
.
The
bartender
was
ON
-
never
missed
a
beat
,
never
left
our
glasses
empty
,
and
was
very
helpful
.
5
+
stars
.
Drinks
?
Limited
tap
selection
,
although
they
have
a
few
interesting
items
:
Great
Lakes
Ale
and
Esthers
Best
were
two
that
stood
out
as
fun
and
not
what
you
'd
normally
find
at
a
more
mainstream
location
.
They
also
have
daily
drink
specials
-
we
tried
the
Lemon
Smash
-LRB-
hand
squeezed
-LRB-
with
each
drink
-RRB-
lemonade
+
vodka
-RRB-
and
the
Whiskey
Old
Fashioned
Sour
.
Both
were
great
.
Food
?
We
tried
the
famous
chili
-
meaty
,
slightly
spicy
,
and
delish
.
Not
the
best
I
've
ever
had
,
but
not
bad
by
any
means
.
We
tried
the
vegetable
beef
soup
-
hearty
,
loaded
with
veggies
,
and
the
meat
was
tender
and
of
good
quality
.
For
our
entrees
,
we
went
a
bit
conservative
-
grilled
chicken
salads
-
but
they
were
huge
and
tasty
.
Fresh
,
fresh
,
fresh
veggies
-
the
tomatoes
were
wonderful
as
were
the
onions
-LRB-
red
,
and
soooo
sweet
-RRB-
.
The
salad
was
definitely
an
unexpected
surprise
-
I
'd
get
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
!
Our
dining
companion
ordered
some
chicken
strips
which
he
requested
be
tossed
in
their
hot
wings
sauce
.
The
result
?
Wow
-
tasty
,
especially
if
you
're
a
fan
of
vinegar-based
wing
sauce
that
packs
a
bit
of
a
kick
.
Really
,
really
good
.
So
,
we
'll
definitely
be
back
-
I
'm
becoming
a
huge
fan
of
the
``
local
''
places
,
and
the
Village
Green
is
definitely
a
``
local
''
place
.
I
ca
n't
wait
to
try
a
burger
or
to
enjoy
some
of
their
other
drink
specials
.

Family

Great

there
with
the
family
for
Friday
which
in
Wisconsin
means
fish
fry
.
Overall
,
good
.
It
was
nice
to
seeing
the
cooks
preparing
your
food
.
Who
knows
what
those
cooks
do
in
those
kitchens
.
Fish
was
good
,
batter
was
a
little
heavy
.
Only
potato
option
was
fries-boo
.
Otherwise
,
good
.
No
complaints.Quaint
little
townie
spot
downtown
Middleton
.
Nice
divey
spot
for
a
beer
.
Inside
smells
like
old
people
and
moth
balls
,
but
they
have
outdoor
seating
.
The
menu
is
very
bar
foodish
,
but
they
make
it
very
well
.
The
chili
was
n't
the
best
,
but
it
was
good
,
and
the
fish
sandwich
was
quite
good
.
That
's
right
,
I
had
chili
and
a
fish
sandwich
,
a
strange
combo.I
've
been
living
in
Middleton
for
about
9
months
now
,
and
I
'm
giving
the
Village
Green
five
stars
for
being
excellent
at
what
it
is
:
a
small
,
local
bar
with
great
service
and
interesting
patrons
.
To
us
,
the
Village
Green
is
the
place
we
go
when
we
want
to
get
out
of
the
house
for
a
drink
and
some
company
.
Once
you
've
been
there
a
few
times
,
everyone
who
works
there
begins
to
recognize
you
and
seems
glad
to
see
you
.
They
have
a
small
menu
of
yummy
fried
items
-LRB-
Spudsters
!
-RRB-
,
great
burgers
and
sandwiches
,
and
daily
specials
-LRB-
love
the
French
Dip
on
Wednesdays
-RRB-
.
All
the
food
is
cooked
right
behind
the
bar
,
and
they
keep
their
cooking
equipment
impeccably
clean
.
They
make
good
drinks
and
have
a
small
but
respectable
selection
of
draft
beers
that
meet
the
needs
of
both
craft
beer
lovers
and
Miller
Lite-types
.
Bartenders
are
not
afraid
to
do
a
shot
of
whiskey
with
you
,
and
many
of
the
regular
patrons
will
buy
you
a
drink
if
you
chat
with
them
.
The
Green
is
owned
by
two
brothers
who
are
almost
always
there
,
cooking
or
bartending
.
The
place
is
closed
on
Sundays
,
and
rarely
stays
open
past
midnight
-
it
's
just
not
that
sort
of
bar
.
Go
across
the
street
to
Hody
for
late-night
drinking
.
Any
other
time
though
,
I
promise
you
'll
find
the
company
much
more
enjoyable
at
Village
Green.First
and
foremost
,
their
burgers
are
INCREDIBLE
and
that
is
reason
enough
to
go
check
it
out
!
I
would
actually
give
this
place
a
3.5
if
that
were
possible
.
I
docked
it
because
it
has
a
limited
menu
with
mostly
fried
food
,
not
many
healthy
dining
options
,
but
then
again
I
'm
not
sure
why
anyone
would
go
there
for
anything
other
than
a
burger
.
It
is
also
definitely
a
dive
,
the
bathrooms
are
a
little
scary
,
but
the
burger
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
best
in
the
Madison
area.Sloppy
Joe
was
pretty
bland
.
I
had
the
spicy
chili
,
good
flavor
.
Fries
were
good
.
Def
will
go
back
and
try
burgers
there.After
the
hype
about
their
burgers
I
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
the
food
here
.
The
meh
:
The
hushpuppies
were
1/2
way
decent
,
but
nothing
extraordinary
.
Edible
.
No
honey
offered
with
them
though
.
The
ugh
:
With
the
all
of
the
acclaim
their
burgers
get
,
you
would
think
that
they
were
doing
something
special
here
.
They
are
n't
.
The
burgers
are
frozen
patties
and
look
like
they
're
right
from
Sysco
.
The
reason
that
people
are
probably
saying
they
're
so
good
is
because
the
patties
are
n't
cooked
within
an
inch
of
a
briquette
.
Normally
I
would
say
that
's
a
good
thing
,
but
when
you
're
making
me
a
burger
from
an
unknown
origin
handled
by
who
knows
how
many
people
...
needless
to
say
,
medium
rare
frozen
beef
patty
is
does
n't
=
amazing
burger
in
my
book
.
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
would
visit
again
.
There
are
far
too
many
amazing
hamburgers
on
the
west
side
made
with
real
beef
from
local
butchers
to
waste
my
time
with
this
place
.
UPDATE
:
I
've
spoken
with
a
couple
of
people
that
are
thinking
it
may
be
a
fluke
that
I
ended
up
with
frozen
patties
the
time
I
was
there
.
Apparently
they
have
a
machine
there
that
they
make
their
patties
with
.
I
'm
going
to
have
to
revisit
in
the
near
future
to
investigate.A
total
dive
but
the
burgers
are
seriously
amazing
.
Bar
tenders
were
friendly
and
the
beer
-LRB-
limited
-RRB-
was
cheap.BEST

ITALIAN

EVER
!
AND
,
Samantha
ROCKS

Great
food
.
Friendly
staff
.
No
complaints.As
many
yelpers
have
said
perfectly
...
the
Village
Green
is
the
idealistic
neighborhood
tap
.
I
had
n't
been
in
over
10
years
,
and
walking
back
in
the
place
looked
exactly
the
same
.
Some
would
call
it
a
bad
thing
,
but
I
find
it
endearing
.
We
've
been
back
a
few
times
now
and
love
going
with
friends
for
a
casual
Friday
night
.
Great
specials
-LRB-
love
the
Friday
fish
...
but
be
prepared
to
eat
only
fried
food
-RRB-
.
My
all-time
favorite
is
their
summer
sausage
reuben
...
if
you
love
reubens
you
can
not
go
wrong
with
this
jewel
!
Fries
are
always
hot
and
fresh
and
service
is
always
friendly
.

,
this
is
the
place.A
bit
awkward
.
Kind
of
like
the
snack
bar
at
a
summer
camp
.
Very
nice
people
in
there
and
the
drinks
were
good
.
Decor
was
lacking
,
but
I
cant
fault
it
much
for
that.Hard
to
pass
up
the
Road
Kill
Burrito
.
Ask
for
the
bucket
of
sauces
.
It
was
as
good
as
when
I
tried
it
ten
years
ago
as
it
was
last
week
.
I
do
n't
think
much
has
changed
around
here
in
30
years
,
but
that
is
definitely
part
of
the
charm
.
I
have
heard
the
fish
fry
is
good
,
but
I
have
never
been
there
on
a
Friday
night
.
Lunch
crowd
has
a
lot
of
regular
guys
,
quick
and
friendly
service
,
prompt
and
hot
food
.
Do
n't
go
looking
for
the
lobster
.
Go
for
the
specials
,
burgers
,
beer
or
the
burrito!I
love
the
small
town
bar
feel
.
Good
food
,
nice
tap
selection
.
Very
comfy
.
``
The
Green
''
has
the
best
burgers
in
the
Madison
area
.
It
's
simple
bar
food
,
but
done
perfectly
.
They
know
what
they
are
doing
here
and
they
are
doing
it
good
.
The
Nachos
are
pretty
awesome
too
.
They
deep
fry
tortillas
for
the
chips
.
If
you
can
,
get
a
spot
at
the
bar
.
It
's
good
times
.
I
do
n't
eat
fish
,
but
some
of
my
friends
and
my
girlfriend
do
,
and
they
like
the
fish
fry
on
Fridays
.
I
'll
stick
to
my
cheeseburger.The
Village
Green
is
a
Wisconsin
bar
with
Packer
memorabilia
,
formica
tables
and
mismatched
chairs
,
and
better
than
average
food
.
It
was
n't
the
best
burger
I
've
ever
had
and
the
fries
and
mushrooms
were
frozen
.
The
corned
beef
sandwich
was
fresh
but
not
fantastic
.
But
it
was
adequate
and
I
'd
return
if
I
had
a
hankering
for
WI
bar
food
.
I
felt
like
I
'd
been
here
before
the
minute
I
walked
in
-
the
menu
and
atmosphere
were
indistinguishable
from
other
taverns
I
'd
been
to
.
Their
tap
beer
selection
was
good
and
its
obvious
they
do
a
lot
of
business
.
If
this
is
what
you
are
looking
for
,
they
do
it
well!Excellent
Friday
fish
fry
!
Their
beer
batter
fish
is
crisp
,
tasty
,
and
not
at
all
greasy
.
The
hush
puppies
were
equally
good
,
but
the
fries
could
use
some
work
.
Our
waiter
had
a
great
personality
and
not
only
provided
good
service
,
but
interesting
trivia
such
as
the
fact
that
our
meal
had
been
prepared
by
Steve
Miller
's
son
-LRB-
of
The
Steve
Miller
Band
fame
-RRB-
.
Reasonable
prices
,
nice-sized
portions
,
good
service
,
and
really
good
food
--
we
'll
be
back!This
place
is
awesome
for
what
it
is
,
a
very
friendly
,
neighborhood
tavern
.
The
food
is
mostly
fried
and
greasy
but
served
with
a
little
slice
of
love
.
The
specials
are
excellent
and
the
value
is
top
notch
.
Want
to
watch
a
game
?
They
have
a
few
big
TV
's
and
are
very
accommodating
.
If
you
are
looking
for
high-end
,
posh
dinning
,
this
is
n't
your
place
.
Madison
has
plenty
of
excellent
choices
in
that
department
.
This
place
is
homey
and
will
serve
you
a
solid
burger
and
fries
,
with
a
starter
of
wings
and
variety
of
homemade
soups
for
a
pretty
good
price
.
Come
in
and
see
these
guys
,
they
do
it
right.Great
old
school
bar
.
Burgers
are
fantastic
.
The
service
is
good
.
the
price
point
is
good
for
Middleton
.
Will
be
going
back
again.The
very
definition
of
a
Wisconsin
bar
.
Good
food
and
they
make
one
of
the
best
old
fashioneds
I
've
ever
had
.
I
wish
they
were
open
on
Sundays
too.Its
Friday
night
...
cold
and
snowing
.
What
is
there
to
do
?
Head
to
the
Village
Green
.
Enjoy
the
Friday
fish
fry
and
yes
,
an
ice
cold
beer
.
So
lets
start
with
the
service
.
It
was
very
good
.
I
walked
in
at
5:06
pm
,
was
immediatly
greeted
and
placed
my
order
within
a
few
minutes
.
By
5:10
pm
I
had
3
pieces
of
hot
cod
,
french
fries
,
2
hush
puppies
and
coleslaw
.
The
meal
was
better
then
expected
and
exceeded
expectations
.
The
Village
Green
is
a
traditional
Wisconsin
Tavern
that
has
great
service
.
I
am
looking
forward
to
next
Friday
already
!
I
forgot
to
mention
that
they
have
a
decent
selection
of
on
tap
beer
.
I
tried
the
Winter
Skull
,
pretty
smooth!As
others
have
already
stated
,
I
am
rating
this
for
what
it
is
...
a
bar
and
grill
,
not
a
fancy
5-Diamond
restaurant
.
I
chose
the
bacon
cheese
burger
with
grilled
onions
and
some
french
fries
;
absolutely
delicious
!
The
burger
is
juicy
and
tasty
...
I
add
some
ketchup
and
mustard
for
good
measure
!
I
sat
in
the
bar
area
and
had
no
problem
getting
service
.
The
bartender
is
quick
and
attentive
;
the
place
was
packed
and
one
bartender
had
the
bar
crowd
and
the
sitting
area
crowd
.
I
also
ordered
a
Capital
Winter
on
tap
and
it
was
poured
perfectly
!
I
have
been
in
the
area
for
three
years
and
I
consistently
return
to
the
Village
Green
as
the
best
burger
in
the
area
.
I
like
the
simplicity
of
the
burger
and
bun
.
The
meat
is
delicious
and
the
bacon
adds
that
extra
umph
!!!!
Also
they
have
nightly
specials
and
I
try
to
target
Tuesday
-LRB-
Sloppy
Joes
-RRB-
and
Thursday
-LRB-
Road
Kill
Burrito
-RRB-
...
both
are
great
!
Quick
,
consistent
service
,
very
tasty
food
and
a
friendly
atmosphere
;
you
can
not
go
wrong.I
've
been
told
they
are
known
for
their
burgers
,
but
their
menu
hosts
a
smattering
of
great
bar
foods
.
Chicken
wings
,
chili
,
seafood
gumbo
,
fish
,
chicken
in
many
forms
,
salads
,
and
even
some
kids
menu
options
.
I
decided
to
try
their
cheese
curds
-LRB-
great
!
-RRB-
and
the
friday
fish
fry
.
The
hush
puppies
were
too
dry
.
I
'd
recommend
staying
away
from
those
.
The
fish
was
good
,
but
the
next
visit
will
be
their
burger.If
you
're
looking
for
a
super
fancy
place
,
keep
looking
...
this
is
your
typical
neighborhood
tavern
and
it
made
me
feel
like
I
was
back
home
in
the
Milwaukee
area
.
The
best
burgers
in
Madison
...
hands
down
!
Good
fries
and
cheese
curds
too
...
they
had
a
number
of
other
dishes
that
sounded
yummy
too
.
Super
friendly
staff
.
We
will
definitely
be
back!The
Village
Green
,
I
call
it
the
VG
for
very
good
.
If
you
want
a
good
greasy
burger
,
crispy
golden
fries
,
non-greasy
crunchy
cheese
curds
,
a
nice
selection
of
local
brews
on
tap
and
fast
friendly
service
this
place
is
for
you.This
past
weekend
I
was
visiting
Madison
for
a
conference
and
ate
at
the
Nitty
Gritty
with
a
group
of
50
people
.
The
service
was
outstanding
,
friendly
,
attentive
and
quick
.
My
water
glass
was
never
empty
.
The
restaurant
has
two
levels
with
high
ceilings
and
polished
wood
floors
.
A
relaxed
,
clean
atmosphere
.
My
table
of
5
started
with
chicken
strips
,
good
and
standard
and
spinach
dip
.
The
spinach
dip
is
excellent
,
extra
cheesy
and
hot
served
with
chips
,
and
fresh
veggies
-
carrots
,
celery
,
broccoli
and
cauliflower
.
We
all
had
burgers
and
fries
.
The
burger
was
enormous
I
could
only
eat
1/2
.
Pretty
good
deal
for
around
$
6
.
If
you
are
in
the
area
I
recommend
the
Nitty
Gritty.A
fun
place
to
go
for
your
birthday
!
The
wait
staff
is
very
friendly
,
easy-going
,
and
kept
checking
on
us
.
We
had
the
Garlic
burger
and
the
Teriyaki
burger
...
very
yummy
...
fries
and
pub
fries
are
recommended
.
Nice
to
go
for
your
birthday
mug
with
unlimited
beer/soda
and
the
world
's
smallest
ice
cream
sundae
.
I
'll
definitely
go
every
year.My
first
Fish
Fry
!
Yum
.
And
they
make
Arnold
Palmers
too!Watched
the
Packers
here
.
Popular
place
for
birthdays
.
Good
food
too
...
Seemed
like
a
draft
of
smoke
came
in
when
the
door
opened
which
was
annoying
...
But
overall
a
great
environment.Maybe
I
missed
something
about
this
place
,
but
after
three
tries
,
I
just
had
to
stop
going
back
hoping
I
would
finally
feel
the
magic
.
The
burgers
are
okay
,
but
there
are
better
ones
in
Madison
.
The
last
time
we
were
there
,
my
son
's
chicken
sandwich
was
overcooked
,
and
they
charged
more
money
since
he
got
it
on
a
pretzel
bun
instead
of
the
regular
bun
.
Our
burgers
were
unremarkable
-
not
that
flavorful
or
moist
.
The
buffalo
wings
were
greasy
and
actually
not
hot
when
we
got
them
.
And
the
last
night
we
were
there
,
a
Friday
at
about
6:00
,
the
place
was
full
and
the
service
was
terrible
.
As
in
waiting
over
fifteen
minutes
after
I
had
piled
all
the
dirty
dishes
at
the
end
of
the
table
as
a
hint
that
we
were
way
done
before
the
server
came
by
wondering
if
we
wanted
anything
else
.
And
somehow
,
with
four
people
,
no
alcoholic
drinks
,
two
appetizers
,
and
four
sandwiches
,
our
bill
was
over
$
70
.
That
's
US
dollars
.
Before
the
tip
.
They
charge
extra
for
everything
-
ranch
on
the
side
,
cheese
on
a
burger
-
everything
.
For
a
really
marginal
meal
and
lousy
service
,
that
was
way
too
much
money.You
know
I
hate
to
do
this
but
I
have
to
agree
with
Vickey
M
.
The
Gritty
burgers
are
something
of
an
acquired
taste
.
They
taste
good
to
me
because
they
bring
back
memories
of
the
70s
.
They
do
have
good
flavor
but
are
somewhat
messy
and
there
are
better
burgers
than
the
Gritty
.
The
bar
was
more
fun
when
it
was
small
.
We
do
n't
go
there
anymore
because
often
it
is
so
busy
that
we
ca
n't
really
enjoy
the
place
like
we
used
to
.
But
I
would
stop
by
again
for
the
Gritty
Burger
.
I
recently
learned
that
the
gritty
burger
recipe
was
changed
in
the
80s
sometime
?
Correct
me
if
I
'm
wrong
.
We
did
think
the
burger
was
somewhat
different
from
what
we
remember
.
Now
we
know
why
.
The
old
burger
that
everyone
loved
was
way
better
than
the
new
one
.
We
think
they
need
to
enlarge
the
place
and
bring
back
the
original
burger
if
they
still
have
the
recipe
.
The
sauce
was
the
bomb.Tonight
the
fam
got
Nitty
Gritty
takeout
,
and
for
me
it
was
a
disappointment
.
I
had
suggested
the
NG
because
I
'd
been
craving
chicken
tenders
all
day
.
In
the
past
,
NG
's
chicken
appeared
to
be
hand-breaded
and
had
a
decent
dose
of
pepper
in
the
breading
to
give
it
some
flavor
.
Tonight
's
offering
was
a
step
above
cafeteria
chicken
strips
.
Flat
,
factory-breaded
,
flavorless
,
and
all
of
them
with
that
gross
gooey
translucent
strip
of
whatever
you
get
in
cheap
chicken
.
Making
it
worse
was
the
addition
of
soggy
fries
and
not-as-good-as-I-remembered
Gritty
sauce
.
For
almost
$
10
,
I
'm
calling
this
a
total
bust
.
Yet
another
restaurant
I
can
cross
off
the
list
for
upping
price
and
cutting
quality.This
Nitty
Gritty
I
would
have
to
say
is
not
as
good
as
the
downtown
madison
one
and
the
sole
reason
is
that
it
is
way
too
small
for
how
many
people
generally
go
there
.
Also
their
dartboard
and
such
is
not
well
placed
and
becomes
a
nuisance
when
trying
to
return
to
the
bar
for
another
drink
.
They
have
good
drink
specials
and
its
still
got
that
classic
nitty
atmosphere
but
not
great
...
I
was
in
town
for
training
at
Epic
.
Wanted
a
bar
with
good
food
to
watch
baseball
playoffs
.
I
remembered
the
Nitty
Gritty
near
campus
from
a
previous
visit
,
so
tried
the
one
in
Middleton
close
to
my
hotel
.
BBQ
Pulled
Pork
sandwich
-
Outstanding
!
Waffle
fries
-
Excellent
Capital
Amber
draft
-
very
good
Atmosphere
-
Fun
Service
-
great
.
Too
bad
it
was
n't
my
birthday
.
It
seemed
that
everyone
there
had
a
birthday
celebration
in
the
group
.
That
's
their
thing
.
I
'll
go
back
,
even
if
it
's
not
my
birthday.Their
prices
have
gone
up
.
The
quality
has
gone
down
.
Medium-well
burger
was
well
done
-LRB-
crispy
,
burnt
-RRB-
.
23
bucks
for
one
gritty
burger
,
one
small
cheese
curd
order
and
two
draft
beers
.
Wow
,
times
have
changed
.
They
just
lost
my
future
business
.
Judging
by
how
few
people
were
there
,
it
looks
like
they
may
be
losing
a
lot
of
business
.
Such
a
shame
,
because
it
used
to
be
fantastic.Meh
.
This
place
does
n't
suck
,
but
it
's
not
very
good
.
The
only
time
you
should
really
go
is
if
it
's
your
birthday
so
you
can
have
free
beer
.
Their
menu
is
incredibly
boring
and
extremely
overpriced
for
the
quality
of
ingredients
that
they
use
.
On
my
most
recent
visit
,
our
table
got
an
order
of
Nachos
to
share
.
With
chicken
,
it
cost
$
12.50
.
It
was
nothing
more
than
a
plate
of
tortilla
chips
covered
in
Day-Glo
orange
cheese
,
jalapeno
slices
,
and
gray
-LRB-
eww
-RRB-
dried
out
chicken
pieces
.
I
also
had
a
burger
as
my
entree
,
and
the
beef
tasted
a
little
funky
,
like
it
had
been
reheated
in
a
microwave
--
almost
metallic
.
My
dining
partner
had
a
salad
that
she
seemed
to
enjoy
,
but
it
's
hard
to
mess
up
a
simple
green
salad
.
Sadly
,
I
've
been
here
more
often
than
I
'd
like
to
admit
because
they
host
Team
Trivia
on
Tuesday
nights
.
My
boyfriend
and
I
decided
to
start
going
somewhere
else
for
trivia
when
we
recently
won
and
got
a
$
40
gift
certificate
and
were
n't
excited
to
use
it
because
it
meant
we
'd
have
to
try
to
consume
more
of
their
crappy
food
.
We
spent
it
mostly
on
booze
instead.Delicious
pork
sandwich
with
coleslaw
and
very
attentive
service
at
modest
prices
in
a
rustic
atmosphereThis
place
is
great
for
birthdays
.
You
get
your
glass
mug
filled
with
beer
,
soda
,
or
juice
with
unlimited
refills
,
while
also
getting
a
very
small
ice
cream
sundae
at
the
end
.
The
burgers
were
very
tasty
and
cooked
as
requested
.
Our
server
was
very
good
and
on
top
of
refills
and
food
came
out
of
the
kitchen
pretty
quick
.
I
liked
the
atmosphere
in
the
dining
area
with
tv
's
mounted
throughout
the
restaurant
.
The
bar
area
was
not
huge
,
but
I
could
see
it
being
a
fun
atmosphere
later
on
in
the
night.Nuh
uh
.
Nope

No

no

My
daughter
wanted
to
eat
here
for
her
birthday
this
year
,
having
eaten
at
the
one
downtown
successfully
4
years
ago
.
Her
birthday
,
her
pick
.
Plus
,
she
delights
in
the
free
mug
of
soda
and
balloon
.
She
's
a
birthday
sell-out
and
I
think
that
must
be
how
they
suck
you
in
.
But
,
I
digress
.
Our
order
took
an
aggravatingly
long
time
to
arrive
and
our
glasses
remained
empty
after
having
drunk
their
contents
while
waiting
.
There
was
a
Packers
game
on
and
many
of
the
wait
staff
were
watching
that
.
I
do
n't
know
if
that
was
the
hold
up
,
but
it
was
a
bit
irritating
.
When
our
meals
finally
arrived
,
my
children
discovered
that
the
insides
of
their
burgers
were
very
pink
.
Waaaaay
too
pink
for
medium
well
,
which
they
ordered
.
It
was
scary
pink
and
super
soft
--
like
raw
hamburger
generally
is
.
When
I
told
our
waiter
about
it
,
he
was
completely
uninterested
in
helping
fix
the
situation
,
and
instead
,
argued
with
me
about
it
for
quite
a
while
,
finally
saying
,
``
That
's
what
medium
well
looks
like
''
in
a
tone
that
suggested
that
I
was
simply
too
stupid
to
know
the
difference
.
I
'm
not
.
Finally
I
convinced
him
to
humor
me
and
take
them
back
to
be
cooked
through
.
He
did
so
with
a
smidgen
of
contempt
.
As
a
side-note
,
my
husband
's
burger
was
to
be
well
done
and
was
also
pink
,
though
not
raw
.
Still
no
drink
refills
.
No
one
offered
a
discount
,
a
refund
,
a
free
soda
while
we
waited
,
and
especially
not
an
apology
.
Obviously
we
wo
n't
be
back.Ok
,
I
heard
from
someone
that
Culver
's
had
cheese
curds
.
-LRB-
For
those
that
do
n't
know
what
a
cheese
curd
is
then
ready
this
wiki
article
.
Do
n't
worry
I
did
n't
know
about
them
until
I
came
to
Wisconsin
.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_curds
-RRB-
So
,
when
class
got
out
early
today
,
I
decided
that
I
needed
to
hunt
for
the
elusive
curds
.
The
easiest
place
to
come
was
here
.
But
the
curds
are
not
the
traditional
curds
,
they
were
fried
curds
,
like
fried
mozzarella
.
A
nice
snack
but
not
exactly
was
I
was
looking
for
...
on
with
the
search
.5
stars
because
1
-RRB-
it
's
Culver
's
and
2
-RRB-
I
refuse
to
let
an
LA
resident
-LRB-
Tracy
G
-RRB-
weigh
down
the
supreme
awesomeness
that
is
Culver
's
based
on
her
misunderstanding
of
cheese
curd
availability!Recycling
in
the
restaurant
.
Our
favorites
are
concrete
shakes
,
the
new
sweet
potato
fries
,
grilled
cheese
,
and
cheeseburger
.
Very
nice
&
friendly
staff
.
Food
was
brought
out
quick
.
Clean
tables
&
restrooms.The
food
here
is
pretty
much
just
like
every
other
Culver
's
that
I
've
ever
been
to
.
It
's
a
chain
,
it
has
to
be
that
way
,
so
I
do
n't
really
care
.
The
cheese
curds
are
good
in
theory
but
their
deep-fried
heavenliness
will
vanquish
your
appetite
pretty
quickly
,
and
then
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
enjoy
your
greasy
,
cheesy
,
mayo-ey
burger
.
Venturing
away
from
the
french
fries
is
generally
not
a
good
idea
.
The
pork
tenderloin
sandwich
is
godlike
.
The
tenderloin
is
about
twice
as
big
as
the
bun
that
it
's
served
on
.
I
feel
like
this
is
my
own
little
secret
since
I
've
never
seen
anybody
else
ordering
or
eating
it
.
Now
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
.
This
place
recently
did
a
renovation
with
a
bunch
of
fake
stone
veneers
and
trendy
curvy
decor
all
over
the
place
.
Not
bad
,
but
I
preferred
the
previous
``
nursing
home
meets
McDonalds
''
vibe
they
had
going
.
They
did
manage
to
improve
the
layout
slightly
so
that
the
soda
dispenser
is
no
longer
right
in
the
way
of
where
people
are
waiting
for
their
to-go
orders
.
It
still
gets
pretty
nuts
at
lunchtime
though
,
so
prepare
to
drive
around
the
parking
lot
a
few
times
looking
for
a
place
.
One
personal
complaint
I
have
with
this
place
is
I
keep
seeing
old
high
school
classmates
working
there
.
I
pretend
not
to
recognize
them.I
do
n't
get
it
?
I
do
n't
understand
the
fascination
with
Culvers
?
The
food
costs
twice
that
of
Wend
's
,
Mc
D
's
,
Hardys
,
or
Burger
King
,
and
with
the
doubling
of
the
price
it
has
double
of
the
grease
!
They
figured
if
you
``
butter
toast
''
the
buns
you
can
serve
stale
bread
and
know
one
will
know
.
If
you
order
through
the
drive
through
you
will
be
given
a
number
and
have
to
wait
.
Worst
yet
if
you
order
a
sundae
you
will
get
it
first
while
you
wait
15-20
minutes
for
you
order
to
cook
.
Just
in
time
for
you
to
enjoy
you
sundae
as
soup
.
Worst
yet
it
is
not
ice
cream
it
is
``
custard
''
.
A
frank
`
en
food
knock
off
of
real
ice
cream
.
Oh
,
and
the
fry
's
are
soggy
.
I
do
n't
get
it
.
Amongst
my
friend
I
'm
apparently
the
only
one
that
does
n't
like
this
place?I
love
Culver
's
.
This
is
fact
.
The
thing
that
makes
this
Culver
's
different
from
the
rest
is
that
they
had
offered
Wisconsin-fare
,
i.e.
Wisconsin
Cheese
Soup
.
Wow
,
was
this
fantastic
!
The
facility
was
clean
,
the
employees
were
very
happy
and
the
food
was
very
tasty
!
I
'm
glad
that
I
can
find
quality
fast-food
,
yet
sit-down
food
across
the
nation!This
is
the
best
Culver
's
around
because
it
is
company
owned
-LRB-
not
franchised
-RRB-
and
they
use
this
store
for
training
new
managers
,
so
everyone
really
knows
their
job
and
they
are
not
miserable
like
most
fast
food
employees
.
And
the
food
is
almost
always
perfect.This
place
is
the
bomb
.
Fresh
burgers
and
the
cheese
curds
are
melt
in
your
mouth
perfect
.
The
service
is
way
above
average
and
the
restaurant
is
very
clean
.
I
have
enjoyed
Culvers
for
years
when
we
would
visit
on
vacation
.
Now
we
live
here
and
we
make
a
weekly
visit
to
Culvers
for
dinner
.
Of
course
you
have
to
top
the
meal
off
with
a
custard
.
It
is
a
fast
food
restaurant
but
it
is
way
above
what
you
would
expect
from
a
fast
food
restaurant.Affordable
,
fast
,
and
yummy
!
Loved
their
Deluxe
burger
and
chocolate
frozen
custard
!
Choco
frozen
custard
was
soo
smooth
and
creamy
--
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
look
at
ice
cream
the
same
!
p.s.
their
cheese
curds
are
pretty
good
too!The
best
Italian
food
in
town
,
hands
down
.
They
've
got
homemade
sausage
that
's
the
best
I
've
ever
had
,
and
they
use
fresh
basil
like
there
's
no
tomorrow
.
My
girlfriend
's
favorite
is
the
pasta
with
giant
prawns
and
pancetta
.
This
place
is
too
good
for
Madison.I
always
crave
Vin
Santo
,
even
though
I
have
n't
been
there
for
years
,
I
still
have
family
back
in
Middleton
,
and
every
time
we
visit
,
we
have
a
feast
!
I
truly
believe
it
offers
some
of
the
best
home
made
Italian
food
in
the
midwest
.
A
real
hidden
Gem
.
And
considering
multiple
family
members
have
worked
there
in
the
past
,
we
know
what
a
tight
ship
is
run
,
and
how
genuine
the
owners
are
in
their
hospitality
and
insistence
for
high
quality
in
everything
they
do
.
Please
give
it
a
try
,
and
DO
NOT
pass
on
the
breadpudding/tiramisu
for
dessert
:
-RRB-
be
warned
that
it
may
ruin
you
for
life
on
anyone
else
's
recipe!Vin
Santo
rules
!
This
is
a
great
casual
restaurant
that
is
owned/operated
a
local
couple
.
She
can
often
be
found
running
the
front
of
the
house
and
he
is
in
the
kitchen
.
Their
passion
is
reflected
in
the
quality
of
their
food
and
the
high
level
of
service
provided
to
their
guests
.
Their
food
is
some
of
the
best
in
the
area
-
they
focus
on
Northern
Italian
cusine
.
It
's
simple
,
fresh
,
and
delicious
!
They
always
offer
a
variety
of
specials
.
The
portions
are
huge
!
You
definitely
feel
like
you
are
getting
your
money
's
worth
.
I
have
never
left
without
leftovers
.
My
favorite
dish
is
the
Scampi
Gabriella
-LRB-
jumbo
shrimp
sauteed
with
garlic
,
pancetta
,
and
scallions
finished
with
a
white
wine
cream
sauce
served
over
linguini
-RRB-
.
Awesome
!!
This
is
easily
the
best
Italian
food
in
the
Madison
area
.
I
've
never
had
a
bad
meal
-LRB-
or
even
a
bad
bite
!
-RRB-
on
a
visit
to
Vin
Santo
.
The
seafood
fettucini
is
really
heavy
on
the
seafood
-LRB-
they
're
not
trying
to
stiff
their
customers
!
-RRB-
and
they
basically
serve
BRICKS
of
incredible
tiramisu
.
Everything
tastes
so
fresh
and
home-made
and
they
offer
a
much
more
interesting
menu
than
most
``
Italian
''
restaurants
in
Madison
.
I
'm
so
happy
that
this
locally-owned
business
has
found
great
success
-
they
have
lots
of
regulars
-LRB-
like
I
used
to
be
!
-RRB-
who
keep
coming
back
for
the
delicious
food
,
big
servings
,
friendly
staff
and
relaxed
atmosphere
.
Vin
Santo
is
a
MUST
for
me
when
I
'm
in
the
area.try
their
appetizer
of
steamed
mussels
and
their
excellent
bread
pudding
-LRB-
huge
portion
-RRB-
.
Their
bread
was
mediocre
.
I
could
n't
remember
what
seafood
pasta
I
ordered
;
it
was
satisfactory
but
not
a
surprise
.
The
manager
is
very
nice
while
the
cook
has
a
funny
attitude
.
We
went
there
craving
for
bread
pudding
at
5p
right
after
they
opened
.
As
the
waitress
submitted
our
order
to
the
chef
,
he
said
,
``
we
do
n't
serve
desert
at
5
.
''
Anyway
,
we
got
our
sweet
tooth
satisfied
along
with
some
tea
for
an
hr
.
I
give
4
stars
for
the
atmosphere
and
the
menu
selection.Delicious
!!
Huge
portions
of
very
authentic
Italian
dishes
.
All
entrees
,
salads
,
apps
and
desserts
can
easily
be
shared
.
Very
cozy
and
wonderful
servers
.
Ca
n't
wait
to
go
back!I
've
now
eaten
twice
at
Vin
Santo
.
Both
times
the
waitstaff
has
been
professional
,
helpful
,
and
speedy
.
The
music
is
at
an
appropriate
level
,
the
atmosphere
is
cozy
,
the
decor
tasteful
.
The
wine
list
is
extensive
,
and
many
dishes
on
the
menu
seem
appetizing
and
imaginative
at
first
glance
.
With
all
of
these
elements
going
for
it
,
I
have
high
expectations
for
the
food
.
Although
some
of
it
is
delicious
,
some
significant
problems
have
arisen
when
I
've
dined
there
.
I
have
had
both
the
bruschetta
and
the
mussels
as
appetizers
.
The
bruschetta
portion
was
a
bit
smaller
than
I
expected
,
but
it
packs
a
large
amount
of
flavor
into
the
bites
.
The
tomatoes
tasted
fresh
and
sweet
,
and
balanced
well
against
the
-LRB-
presumably
-RRB-
homemade
pesto
.
The
fresh
bread
served
at
the
table
is
similarly
warm
,
with
a
crisp
crust
and
toothsome
interior
.
The
mussels
are
flavorful
and
delicious
,
but
they
do
n't
come
with
any
bread
to
sop
up
the
flavorful
broth
that
remains
after
the
mussels
have
been
eaten
.
Our
plate
was
whisked
away
before
we
had
a
chance
to
ask
for
any
bread
to
go
with
the
sauce
.
Two
of
my
companions
ordered
the
Ravioli
al
Vin
Santo
;
both
liked
and
finished
the
dish
.
It
is
one
of
four
vegetarian
options
-LRB-
the
Fettucini
alla
Putenesca
does
not
list
meat
,
but
I
've
never
heard
of
a
putanesca
sauce
made
without
anchovies
-RRB-
,
which
was
a
welcome
surprise
for
the
vegetarian
with
whom
I
dined
.
One
companion
ordered
the
Insalata
di
Caesare
-LRB-
which
also
has
unlisted
anchovies
in
the
dressing
-RRB-
,
and
found
it
flavorful
,
if
unimaginative
.
A
fourth
companion
ordered
the
Lasagna
del
Giorno
-LRB-
that
day
it
was
with
roasted
chicken
-RRB-
,
and
savored
every
bite
.
A
fifth
companion
ordered
the
Fettucini
alla
Putenesca
,
of
which
I
tried
a
bite
.
The
spinach
fettucini
was
fresh
and
delicious
,
and
the
sauce
was
perfectly
salty
.
My
entree
,
the
Campenelli
il
Diavolillo
,
was
pretty
awful
.
The
combination
of
meat
and
seafood
in
a
dish
can
be
done
artfully
,
but
this
felt
like
a
clumsy
mishmash
of
shrimp
,
chicken
,
and
Italian
sausage
.
The
sausage
was
very
sweet
and
seemed
to
lack
enough
oregano
,
basil
,
and
garlic
.
It
clashed
notably
with
the
rest
of
the
dish
.
The
shrimp
and
chicken
were
both
cooked
well
,
and
were
tender
and
juicy
.
The
pasta
was
fresh
and
tasty
.
It
was
really
a
shame
that
the
``
spicy
garlic
broth
''
as
described
by
the
menu
translated
into
nearly
an
inch
of
oil
at
the
bottom
of
the
dish
,
making
the
entire
dish
almost
inedible
.
All
portions
were
huge
.
The
desserts
are
delicious
.
The
tiramisu
,
which
I
sampled
on
my
first
visit
,
is
fluffy
and
sweet
.
I
tried
to
order
it
on
my
return
visit
,
but
the
waitress
told
me
she
had
sold
the
last
piece
to
a
table
that
came
in
after
us
.
Since
we
arrived
at
5
p.m.
,
this
came
as
quite
a
shock
.
It
seems
unlikely
that
they
started
the
evening
's
service
with
more
than
one
piece
of
tiramisu
,
and
seems
like
profoundly
poor
planning
.
The
bread
pudding
,
while
not
much
to
look
at
,
is
also
delicious
,
though
it
is
so
rich
that
by
the
time
we
finished
one
portion
-LRB-
between
three
people
-RRB-
it
almost
felt
like
i
was
eating
a
stick
of
butter
rolled
in
cinnamon
.
I
ca
n't
say
I
'll
be
back
anytime
soon
.
I
have
to
disagree
with
Zenide
R.
's
assertion
that
it
's
``
easily
the
best
Italian
food
in
the
Madison
area
.
''
For
the
price
,
both
Lombardino
's
and
Tutto
Pasta
make
better
Italian
food
,
and
I
shall
stick
to
those
restaurants
in
the
future.I
went
here
for
a
friend
's
graduation
dinner
.
The
seating
area
was
filled
.
We
had
reservations
and
they
were
right
on
time
.
The
service
and
level
of
professionalism
was
great
.
The
menu
is
vegan
friendly
with
a
few
delicious
options
.
I
tried
a
friend
's
baked
eggplant
dish
and
it
was
by
far
the
best
eggplant
course
I
've
ever
had
.
Many
people
in
my
party
ordered
the
lasagna
and
loved
it
.
I
ordered
the
pesto
and
was
disappointed
.
The
homemade
noodles
were
good
but
the
pesto
did
n't
have
the
pop
of
basil
I
was
hoping
for
.
Despite
the
pesto
sauce
,
the
experience
as
a
whole
was
great
.
I
would
definitely
recommend
this
establishment.I
went
to
Vin
Santo
with
some
work
colleagues
while
in
Middleton
for
a
conference
,
and
it
was
terrific
!
The
restaurant
is
small
,
with
dimmed
lights
,
which
makes
for
a
cozy
setting
.
The
hostess
and
waitress
were
very
welcoming
.
We
arrived
around
7:45
on
a
Tuesday
,
and
we
were
the
only
people
in
the
restaurant
,
which
seemed
unusual
,
but
maybe
it
was
because
it
was
a
weekday
?
Anyway
,
I
ordered
the
scampi
carciofi
,
which
consisted
of
shrimp
,
garlic
,
artichokes
,
olive
oil
,
and
cherry
tomatoes
served
over
spinach
fettuccine
.
The
portion
was
HUGE
,
and
the
food
was
fresh
and
very
tasty
.
My
colleagues
had
the
eggplant
parmigiana
,
which
looked
and
smelled
delicious
,
and
a
chicken
dish
that
I
ca
n't
remember
the
name
of
,
but
which
also
looked
pretty
good
.
I
'm
not
sure
Vin
Santo
is
the
best
place
for
a
business
dinner
,
but
for
a
romantic
date
,
it
's
perfect
.
I
will
make
sure
to
come
back
here
whenever
I
am
in
the
Madison
area
,
and
I
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
hearty
,
delicious
Italian
meal.We
fell
into
Vin
Santo
on
a
busy
Friday
night
before
a
recent
marathon
that
the
PIC
was
running
in
.
Despite
the
wait
-LRB-
45
minutes
-RRB-
the
owner
-LRB-
a
sweet
and
thoughtful
English
woman
-RRB-
made
every
effort
to
accommodate
us
and
move
us
up
the
list
,
even
asking
other
patrons
if
they
minded
waiting
just
a
couple
more
minutes
.
As
for
the
food
,
none
of
us
could
complain
about
being
short-changed
...
especially
the
PIC
who
was
carb-loading
.
The
plates
were
absolutely
delicious
and
huge
-LRB-
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
Salsiccia
Rossa
--
pasta
with
so
much
homemade
Italian
sausage
that
I
had
to
take
it
home
without
noodles
!
-RRB-
.
We
all
walked
away
thinking
we
could
n't
have
picked
a
better
spot
nor
gotten
a
better
deal
.
The
decor
was
very
nice
and
clean
and
the
staff
as
mentioned
previously
was
very
helpful
.
We
'll
definitely
be
back.Great
food
,
large
portions
and
attentive
staff.We
love
Vin
Santo
and
have
gone
there
about
every
month
or
two
for
3
years
.
Small
place
,
warm
and
inviting
,
and
the
lovely
host/owner
Clarissa
greets
us
like
family
when
we
walk
in
.
Her
husband/chef
makes
fabulous
and
imaginative
sauces
to
accompany
the
comforting
Italian
dishes
.
Their
italian
sausage
is
probably
the
best
we
've
had
anywhere
-LRB-
including
fancy
places
in
LA
,
NYC
,
Philly
,
etc
-RRB-
.
There
are
special
lasagna
,
fish
,
and
ravioli
dishes
every
night
.
The
lasagna
is
cooked
to
order
so
it
takes
a
while
,
but
is
so
worth
it
.
If
you
are
lucky
enough
to
go
on
an
Italian
sausage
lasagna
night
,
the
portion
is
enormous
,
and
every
bite
-LRB-
yes
,
every
bite
-RRB-
includes
sausage
and
cheese
-
it
's
the
bomb
.
I
had
a
veal
ravioli
in
a
butter
sage
sauce
recently
that
was
fabulous
,
and
unlike
some
pricey
new
Italian
places
where
the
portion
is
5
or
so
ravioli
,
this
dish
had
10
or
12
large
ones
.
In
fact
,
all
the
portions
are
large
,
and
really
reasonably
priced
.
Their
wine
selection
is
pretty
sparse
,
and
we
have
n't
had
good
look
finding
one
we
like
.
But
that
is
the
only
down
side
to
what
is
always
a
fantastic
and
totally
filling
meal
.
We
are
usually
too
full
for
dessert
,
but
they
do
make
their
own
tiramisu
,
which
is
light
,
fluffy
,
creamy
,
and
enormous
.
Get
one
if
you
have
someone
to
share
it
with
.
Recently
they
have
added
a
couple
of
desserts
,
including
a
caramel
cheesecake
,
which
I
hope
I
am
not
too
full
to
try
someday.Our
family
of
four
dined
at
Vin
Santo
the
Monday
after
the
new
year
.
We
expected
it
to
be
quiet
but
it
was
a
happy
busy
place
.
The
lone
chef
in
the
kitchen
kept
food
coming
at
a
steady
pace
,
quicker
then
anticipated
.
The
two
wait
staff
was
attentive
,
friendly
and
very
professional
.
We
had
a
white
pizza
appetizer
,
loved
the
dried
tomato
pesto
.
We
each
ordered
an
entree
which
were
all
very
good
.
The
fine
sauces
,
ingredients
and
preparation
was
far
superior/delicious
compared
to
the
usual
Italian
restaurant
!!
Portions
were
very
large
so
three
of
us
enjoyed
them
again
the
next
day
.
We
enjoyed
tastes
of
two
desserts
,
tirimisu
and
bread
pudding
.
Again
treats
for
the
next
day
.
Great
food
,
great
service
and
a
casual
friendly
atmosphere
,
a
restaurant
to
return
to
again
and
again
!!
Great
Italian
eatery
.
The
atmosphere
is
homey
and
intimate
.
I
had
the
spaghetti
with
pine
nuts
,
olives
,
capers
,
and
anchovies
in
homemade
tomato
sauce
.
This
dish
was
alright
.
I
liked
the
idea
of
adding
pine
nuts
,
but
the
olives
AND
capers
made
it
too
salty
for
my
tastes
.
I
had
some
leftovers
and
they
were
definitely
better
the
next
day
even
if
they
were
still
a
little
salty
.
DEFINITELY
get
the
Tirimasu
cake
while
there
.
It
was
wonderful
.
Not
too
rich
,
but
soaked
in
expresso
and
very
flavorful
.
There
is
a
mascarpone
cheese
based
whip
cream
which
is
light
and
not
too
sweet
that
makes
the
cake
amazing.Balling
in
Middleton
.
Definitely
a
good
place
if
you
do
n't
mind
driving
from
Madtown.My
boyfriend
surprised
me
for
Valentines
day
here
,
impressive
I
know
:-RRB-
.
It
was
like
we
were
back
in
Italy
.
It
's
a
tiny
little
place
with
very
authentic
italian
dishes
.
They
make
the
lasagna
fresh
in
individual
servings
when
you
order
it
.
It
was
amazing
.
I
had
the
seafood
pasta
-LRB-
my
standard
order
-RRB-
which
was
HUGE
.
I
mean
you
should
definitely
split
this
.
We
ended
the
night
with
the
tiramisu
...
and
let
me
tell
you
,
I
am
a
tiramisu
connoisseur
-LRB-
i
pretty
much
order
it
every
time
it
's
on
the
menu
-RRB-
and
this
was
the
BEST
tiramisu
I
have
ever
had
.
It
even
beats
the
stuff
I
had
in
Italy
.
All
in
all
this
a
perfect
romantic
,
date
place
and
I
would
definitely
return
.
``
Ummm
Good
.
Yummy
.
Tasty
.
What
is
this
delicious
piece
?
Do
you
wan
na
try
this
?
It
's
good
.
''
Those
are
pretty
much
what
my
bf
and
I
said
to
each
other
during
our
Valentine
's
day
dinner
.
No
footsies
or
romantic
hand
holding
but
just
shuffling
forks
with
an
extreme
eager
to
try
each
other
's
plate
.
Vin
Santo
is
THAT
good
.
I
got
seafood
Ravioli
with
pine
nuts
,
which
completely
blew
me
away
.
It
is
by
far
the
best
Italian
food
I
've
ever
had
.
They
made
their
own
bread
:
crisp
and
tender
.
Their
Tiramisu
will
brighten
up
all
of
your
taste
bulbs
.
Appetizers
and
desserts
are
made
for
sharing
,
so
be
friendly
to
each
other
,
less
conservative
and
share
.
Go
make
a
reservation
now
.
You
'll
love
this
place.Party
of
4
celebrating
a
birthday
...
Seated
immediately
.
Intimate
seating
,
some
chairs
a
little
close
.
Food
was
delivered
piping
hot
and
service
was
good
.
Food
we
had
was
the
lasagne
-LRB-
huge
portions
-RRB-
and
salmon
and
one
spaghettti
,
all
outstanding
.
No
salads
,
but
they
looked
good
.
The
only
annoyance
was
the
chef/owner
?
Numerous
times
during
our
dinner
he
was
grumbling/shouting
loud
enough
for
us
to
hear
from
our
table
,
kinda
shouting
at
his
sous
chef
or
someone
in
the
kitchen
and
on
several
occasions
came
out
and
sat
and
kinda
watched
people
eating
.
.
-LRB-
weird
-RRB-
and
grumbled
to
the
hostess
about
not
doing
her
job.In
appearance
,
she
seemed
to
be
very
efficient
at
her
job
and
had
stopped
at
our
table
and
asked
how
our
food
was
,
etc.
.
Upon
leaving
,
he
was
in
the
front
of
the
house
grumbling
again
...
Not
a
good
thing
to
do
!
I
would
go
again
,
based
on
the
food
,
but
hope
this
man
leaves
his
sour
attitude
out
of
the
customers
face
.
.
Tiramusu
amazing
.
Fed
all
four
of
us
with
no
problem.Was
up
in
Madtown
from
Chicago
to
run
the
Crazylegs
and
used
that
as
a
nice
excuse
to
carbo
load
.
Was
absolutely
blown
away
by
the
food
here
.
There
is
plenty
of
great
Italian
in
Chicago
and
this
was
equal
to
better
than
anything
I
've
had
in
Little
Italy
.
We
split
a
couple
caesar
salads
,
Salsiccia
Rossa
,
Pollo
Tuscana
,
and
Linquini
Pecorino
.
Everything
was
incredible
fresh
and
tasty
.
Pasta
was
cooked
to
a
PERFECT
al
dente
on
all
dishes
.
Nothing
was
oversauced
.
The
homemade
Italian
sausage
was
awesome
-LRB-
wish
it
was
spicier
-RRB-
.
Honestly
some
of
the
best
homemade
Italian
I
've
ever
had
.
Ambiance
is
great
,
feels
like
you
're
in
someone
's
home
.
The
tables
and
chairs
look
like
a
collection
from
a
garage
sale
...
mean
that
in
a
good
way
.
There'a
a
really
tiny
bar
upfront
that
seats
4
people
.
Do
NOT
miss
the
tiramisu
--
simple
sensational
.
Canoli
was
good
but
was
my
least
favorite
part
of
the
meal
.
Shell
was
a
little
too
overcooked
for
me
and
found
the
filling
to
be
good
but
a
little
gritty
.
All
in
all
easy
4
,
if
not
4.5
stars
.
Will
be
back
next
time
up
in
the
area.
,
Adam
was
my
server
and
did
a
great
job
of
suggesting
things
as
well
as
being
a
helpful
opinion
when
I
was
choosing
between
one
dish
or
another
...
-
Calamari
was
heavenly
and
really
hearty
and
heavy
...
this
is
not
the
kind
of
calamari
that
you
get
at
Olive
Garden
or
most
Italian
restaurants
...
this
was
heavenly
...
perfect
bit
of
spiciness
and
the
portion
was
enormous
-
Scampi
Gabriela
...
was
amazing
...
the
pasta
was
perfectly
al
dente
...
and
the
shrimp
were
huge
...
a
legitimate
dinner
portion
that
you
had
to
take
home
-
Bread
Pudding
for
dessert
...
not
at
all
the
type
that
you
get
at
other
restaurants
again
...
this
was
mushy
and
did
n't
resemble
the
bread
pudding
I
'm
use
to
...
but
it
was
actually
the
best
bread
pudding
I
've
ever
had
...
it
was
simply
mouthwatering
-
I
had
a
glass
of
pinot
noir
with
my
dinner
and
it
was
a
great
accompaniment
to
my
meal
One
of
the
owners
...
Clarissa
came
by
and
personally
asked
how
I
liked
the
food
and
the
service
...
we
had
a
long
chat
...
told
her
what
I
loved
and
a
few
pointers
...
she
has
the
same
name
as
my
mom
so
I
instantly
felt
a
connection
with
her
...
This
is
a
MUST
when
in
town
...
I
will
definitely
be
back!I
would
love
to
rate
their
food
,
but
never
got
the
opportunity
.
Happened
to
stop
there
on
a
Saturday
evening
at
about
5:45
p
and
could
not
even
get
in
the
door
because
the
hostess
was
blocking
the
area
with
a
party
of
four
.
Instead
of
taking
the
party
aside
so
we
could
enter
,
and
I
should
point
out
I
was
on
crutches
,
she
had
us
wait
outside
until
she
could
seat
them
.
We
entered
AND
STEPPED
ASIDE
so
others
could
enter
.
There
were
three
in
a
our
party
.
When
she
asked
if
we
had
reservations
,
I
replied
no
,
and
she
commented
NO
?
You
KNOW
IT
IS
SATURDAY
.
I
wanted
to
say
yes
,
yesterday
was
Friday
and
tomorrow
is
Sunday
.
Instead
I
replied
that
I
was
TERRIBLY
sorry
i
did
not
realize
i
needed
a
reservation
,
and
she
once
again
reminded
me
it
was
SATURDAY
.
I
had
never
been
there
and
did
not
realize
that
it
was
a
quaint
,
small
place
.
Had
I
known
,
I
would
certainly
made
a
reservation
.
I
probably
will
not
make
a
reservation
and
try
the
menu
since
the
hostess
obviously
thought
I
did
not
know
what
day
it
was
.
Yes
,
it
is
probably
my
loss
,
but
I
do
n't
enjoy
being
insulted.I
ca
n't
think
of
anything
bad
to
say
about
Vin
Santo
!
The
prices
are
the
same
as
Olive
Garden
but
the
food
is
10x
the
quality
and
5x
as
authentic
!
I
have
eaten
at
Vin
Santo
five
times
now
and
I
am
never
disappointed
,
everything
I
have
had
is
delicious
,
and
the
dessert
-LRB-
bread
pudding
,
tiramisu
-RRB-
is
to
die
for
.
The
owner
is
very
sweet
and
accommodating
and
she
is
there
everytime
I
go
,
it
's
a
local
family
owned
business
with
world
class
cuisine!Really
a
wonderful
Italian
Food
experience
.
Everything
was
delicious
.
Service
was
attentive
,
but
not
overly
stuffy
.
Bread
pudding
is
unattractive
,
but
super
delicious
.
Price
is
high
,
but
worth
it.Everything
was
baked
fresh
,
so
expect
a
little
bit
of
a
longer
wait
,
but
well
worth
it
.
Very
generous
portions
--
best
plan
would
probably
be
to
get
salads
and
split
an
entree
or
plan
to
bring
some
home
with
you
.
I
had
the
italian
sausage
lasagna
,
which
was
very
very
good.I
would
rate
vin
santo
at
2.5
stars
for
food
and
4
stars
for
service
.
I
guess
I
'm
used
to
great
Italian
fare
in
San
francisco
,
but
the
food
at
Vin
Santo
didnt
quite
cut
it
for
me
both
times
I
've
eaten
here
.
The
portions
are
large
,
but
taste
doesnt
cut
it
for
me.Outstanding
!
This
was
our
first
time
here
and
it
was
great
.
The
server
was
very
nice
and
responsive
-LRB-
he
could
have
known
a
little
more
about
the
wine
selection
,
but
that
was
n't
a
big
deal
-RRB-
.
The
food
was
great
,
light
sauces
and
tons
of
flavor
.
We
will
definitely
be
back!This
is
my
new
favorite
restaurant
in
the
Madison
area
.
Everything
that
crossed
our
table
from
the
fresh
pastas
to
the
delicious
sauces
was
a
treat
.
The
portions
were
generous
and
the
prices
reasonable
.
The
calamari
in
the
appetizer
was
tender
and
delicious
in
a
rich
and
spicy
tomato/fennel
sauce
.
The
puttanesca
sauce
was
dense
with
olives
and
the
whole
cloves
of
roasted
garlic
were
a
real
treat
.
The
bread
pudding
was
very
good
,
but
for
me
was
a
little
heavy
on
the
cinnamon
.
I
think
I
'll
go
with
the
Tiramisu
next
time
.
Our
water
was
pleasant
and
attentive
.
The
atmosphere
was
casual
and
cozy/romantic
...
but
I
would
rather
see
real
candles
on
the
tables
vs
the
battery
operated
tea
lights.GET
THE
BREAD
PUDDING
!!!
...
This
is
a
nice
restaurant
that
is
cramped
and
casually
decorated
.
The
food
is
the
stand
out
.
The
front
is
run
by
one
of
the
owners
and
her
service
is
very
brief
as
she
seats
you
and
quickly
moves
on
to
the
next
task
.
The
waitresses
do
a
great
job
with
the
specials
and
describing
the
menu
.
Food
is
delivered
in
an
acceptable
amount
of
time
.
You
can
see
the
chef
and
the
kitchen
through
the
window
between
the
kitchen
and
the
dining
room
which
is
always
fun
.
Their
red
sauce
has
a
bit
of
spicy
heat
to
it
.
My
wife
and
I
really
do
like
this
place
for
its
great
food
and
for
its
character.Average
food
,
good
service
,
poor
ambience
.
If
you
want
something
a
lot
better
and
do
n't
mind
the
extra
bucks
,
go
around
the
corner
to
Louisianne
's
.
Fresh
Italian
food
with
a
emphasis
on
fish
dishes
and
cream
sauces.I
had
an
unbelievable
experience
yesterday
.
I
went
to
Vin
Santo
hoping
to
order
some
food
to
go
.
Upon
brief
greeting
the
owner
informed
us
that
they
``
do
n't
do
takeout
on
the
weekend
''
.
This
is
astonishing
and
something
that
has
never
happened
to
me
before
.
I
am
a
foodie
an
have
dined
on
5
different
continents
,
including
Michelin
rated
restaurants
.
Shocked
,
we
went
to
Villa
Dolce
where
the
owner
was
very
accommodating
to
our
take
out
request
.
The
food
was
delicious
and
very
reasonably
priced
.
Your
loss
Vin
Santo
.
We
are
never
coming
back.All
I
ever
want
is
to
go
to
a
restaurant
and
get
a
giant
bowl
of
fresh
pasta
that
is
stuffed
with
seafood
,
and
that
's
what
I
got
!
They
are
super
duper
friendly
here
.
It
is
a
nice
restaurant
,
but
not
stuffy
at
all
.
Leave
the
tuxes
at
home
boys
.
The
atmosphere
is
more
casual
and
quaint
.
The
dishes
are
more
rustic
Italian
,
rather
than
fancy
schmansy
Italian
.
The
bread
pudding
comes
a
little
messy
,
but
so
good
,
the
table
will
definitely
fight
for
it
.
There
is
n't
much
seating
,
so
be
sure
to
make
a
reservation
ahead
of
time
.
You
can
even
do
it
online
,
so
that
's
cool
.
Plus
,
the
aroma
is
completely
mouth
watering
.
Ca
n't
wait
to
go
back
there

Pasta.Great
food
,
portions
could
be
smaller
.
A
little
pricey
for
Middleton
.
Would
try
somewhere
else
next
time
but
would
also
not
hesitate
to
return.One
of
Middleton
's
hidden
gems
.
It
's
our
favorite
place
to
go
for
special
occasions
!
Be
sure
to
try
the
``
lasagna
of
the
day
''
.
It
's
always
worth
it.it
was
okay
...
small
place
but
the
food
was
good
...
large
portions
...
Does
not
live
up
to
a
recent
review
in
Madison
paper
.
Cons
:
Too
pricey
&
ala
carte
.
The
pasta
dishes
in
range
$
15
-
$
20
.
The
entrees
:
$
20
-
30
.
The
decor
needs
fresh
paint
and
new
carpet
and
the
restroom
slightly
grotty
.
Server
forgot
to
put
in
some
of
our
order
.
My
ravioli
vin
santo
was
lacking
flavor
.
Need
to
serve
parmesan
cheese
with
the
bread
&
oil
.
Plus
:
Nice
people
.
Good
Tuscan
mushroom
soup
.
For
the
tiny
storefront
,
family
restaurant
it
is
priced
too
high
which
sets
your
expectations
higher
and
does
not
live
up
to
those
expectations
.
It
would
be
fine
for
your
corner
Italian
joint
for
everyday
meals
if
they
offered
a
salad
with
the
meal
and
cut
their
$
$
.
Unbelievably
disappointed
.
I
'm
in
town
for
business
,
and
went
on
a
week
night
.
They
were
not
terribly
busy
,
but
as
a
solo
diner
,
I
was
treated
quite
poorly
.
Mostly
ignored
during
my
meal
,
I
had
to
get
up
to
chase
someone
down
just
for
a
water
refill
.
Not
once
did
anyone
check
on
my
meal
-LRB-
I
would
have
loved
a
second
glass
of
wine
-RRB-
,
which
was
n't
stellar
anyway
.
I
did
stop
and
tell
the
woman
at
the
front
that
not
every
diner
has
the
luxury
of
being
able
to
eat
with
family
or
friends
,
and
that
I
felt
my
service
was
horrible
.
Maybe
it
'll
spare
the
next
person
eating
alone
and
hoping
for
good
service
.
I
travel
to
Madison
Wi
frequently
for
work
,
and
I
can
tell
you
that
they
'll
not
get
repeat
business
from
me.Vin
Santo
is
a
good
,
but
small
Italian
restaurant
in
Middleton
.
There
's
a
larger
selection
of
pastas
at
this
place
than
most
other
Italian
restaurants
in
the
area
.
But
other
than
that
,
it
seems
like
the
standard
Italian
.
The
lasagna
is
okay
,
but
small
.
But
most
of
the
pasta
dishes
are
legit
and
are
served
with
good
portions
.
Service
is
kind
of
slow
and
I
'd
recommend
getting
a
reservation
on
weekends
.
Nonetheless
,
dessert
is
great
.
Though
expensive
,
their
Italian
bread
pudding
and
tiramisu
are
huge
and
tasty.I
absolutely
loved
this
little
restaurant
!
Its
tucked
away
and
has
a
very
intimate
atmosphere
.
The
Italian
food
tastes
homemade
and
authentic
.
This
is
a
great
place
for
a
date
but
not
for
a
family.The
food
is
very
good
,
but
overpriced
.
My
wife
's
favorite
dessert
is
bread
pudding
and
I
was
told
this
place
has
the
best
bread
pudding
around
,
and
it
did
not
disappoint
,
it
was
excellent
.
The
food
was
also
very
good
.
My
wife
ordered
mushroom
and
onion
ravioli
and
her
dish
was
better
than
mine
.
I
ordered
a
pasta
dish
with
sauteed
shrimp
,
spicy
italian
sausage
and
chicken
.
It
was
also
excellent
,
but
I
thought
it
could
've
done
without
the
chicken
.
I
started
with
a
caesar
salad
and
it
tasted
really
fishy
.
Also
,
the
portions
are
huge
,
if
you
're
going
with
one
other
person
,
you
could
probably
split
everything
.
The
service
was
excellent
,
but
the
decor
was
n't
very
appealing
,
and
as
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
,
it
's
a
very
small
space
.
I
'd
check
it
out
,
especially
to
try
the
bread
putting
,
but
it
's
not
a
must.Nice
place
.
Like
others
said
not
really
that
impressive
on
the
inside
,
the
tables
are
really
jammed
in
there
.
I
guess
that
ok
if
you
do
n't
mind
you
waitresses
butt
in
your
face
and
food
when
she
is
at
the
table
next
to
you
.
I
ordered
pasta
with
scallops
,
shrimp
,
mussels
,
and
calamari
with
a
slightly
spicy
tomato
sauce
.
It
was
ok
.
The
pasta
was
cooked
perfect
.
And
again
like
others
said
,
it
really
lacked
salt
.
The
seafood
was
good
lots
of
mussels
could
have
used
more
shrimp
and
scallops
and
a
lot
less
squid
!
My
wife
had
the
special
of
giant
homemade
ravioli
with
a
caramelized
onion
and
portabello
mushrooms
in
a
balsamic
sauce
.
This
was
really
tasty
.
The
bread
pudding
is
amazing
!
Not
pretty
to
look
at
but
delicious
!
The
coffee
is
great
too
!
Would
give
more
stars
if
they
used
a
little
more
salt
and
a
few
less
tables
.
I
would
have
also
liked
to
see
a
few
more
meat
choices
.
The
menu
is
really
mostly
seafood
and
chicken
.
A
few
sausage
offerings
but
no
other
choices
of
meat
.
A
nice
steak
would
do
wonders.With
all
of
the
Italian
restaurants
in
Madison
It
's
hard
for
me
to
give
this
place
more
than
3
stars
.
We
started
out
with
Mussels
that
were
served
in
a
butter
sauce
.
The
mussels
tasted
a
little
bit
fishy
for
my
liking
.
For
my
main
course
I
had
veal
tortellini
.
The
better
half
had
a
shrimp
pasta
in
a
white
cream
sauce
.
Her
dish
was
far
btter
than
mine
.
For
desert
we
had
bread
pudding
and
tiramisu
.
Both
were
excellent
.
My
Biggest
gripes
about
this
place
were
the
kitchen
is
super
small
,
so
it
can
take
quite
a
while
to
get
your
food
.
Also
,
they
have
very
few
options
for
kids.BEWARE
:
SERVING
SIZES
ARE
GINORMOUS
!
We
did
not
know
this
^
^
and
over-ordered
!!
Next
time
the
BF
and
I
are
splitting
a
plate
of
pasta
!
Calamari
appetizer
was
SO
inexpensive
and
SO
much
food
!
In
fact
I
think
all
their
dishes
are
underpriced
for
the
quantity
that
you
get
.
This
was
the
most
delicious
app
I
have
had
--
so
flavorful
and
so
FRESH
!
On
top
of
the
calamari
we
also
got
the
sausage
pasta
and
the
seafood
pasta
.
Both
had
heaping
amounts
of
food
and
delicious
in
their
own
sense
.
We
were
seafood-ed
out
after
the
appetizer
so
we
were
devouring
the
sausage
pasta
.
The
sauce
for
the
sausage
pasta
was
amazing
--
we
took
the
noodles
from
the
seafood
dish
and
dunked
it
in
the
other
plate
's
sauce
to
drink
it
all
up
:
-RRB-
Not
exactly
a
hot
spot
for
me
,
dinner
was
good
,
but
I
've
had
better
...
Unbelievably
good
food
.
Portions
are
huge
and
everything
is
freshly
prepared
and
flavorful
.
The
ravioli
is
excellent
!
Authentic
and
homemade
.
Friendly
servers
and
it
can
get
pretty
crowded
so
make
a
reservation
on
the
weekend!On
rare
occasions
I
am
transported
back
to
Italy
--
either
by
the
ambiance
,
the
hospitality
,
or
the
flavors
of
a
restaurant
.
Tonight
I
have
had
that
experience
as
a
result
of
the
hospitality
and
flavors
of
Vin
Santo
.
I
had
the
ravioli
pasta
special
and
it
was
wonderful
.
The
decor
is
somewhat
meh
,
but
the
food
was
great
.
The
servers
make
the
cocktails
,
which
seemed
odd
.
I
will
come
back
with
each
visit
to
Madison
...
My
wife
and
I
ended
up
here
because
it
had
outdoor
seating
and
was
happy
to
accommodate
our
dogs
.
It
had
excellent
service
.
The
food
was
fantastic
.
The
plates
we
had
were
simple
fare
with
exceptional
ingredients
.
The
chef
did
a
wonderful
job
mixing
and
balancing
flavors
.
Even
the
bar
tender
nailed
the
Bellini
's
.
It
is
very
reasonable
priced
by
which
I
mean
a
good
,
long
dinner
-LRB-
2
hours
+
-RRB-
for
two
with
appetizer
and
drinks
will
probably
come
to
about
$
100
.
It
is
worth
it
!
If
just
having
dinner
and
a
glass
of
wine
expect
somewhere
closer
to
$
50
-
$
60
.
This
is
a
great
place
to
dine!After
looking
around
Madison
for
a
good
and
authentic
Italian
place
,
Vin
Santo
has
the
potential
.
The
pasta
is
definitely
fresh
,
and
the
tiramisu
was
very
good
.
Downsides
-
I
felt
that
the
dishes
could
have
used
more
finesse
in
the
seasoning
and
flavor
and
less
in
the
overall
amount
,
they
were
tasty
but
did
not
just
pop
out
at
me
.
For
instance
,
the
ravioli
was
great
-
good
pasta
and
sauce
,
but
the
spinach
stuffing
was
just
bland
.
Nevertheless
,
I
will
go
back
-
need
to
find
out
if
some
of
those
spicier
dishes
are
truly
spicy.This
is
one
of
my
favorite
restaurants
in
Middleton
.
The
hostess
and
servers
are
friendly
,
and
the
food
is
delicious
.
Entrees
are
large
and
flavorful
.
Salads
are
also
large
and
fresh
.
Salad
is
not
included
with
an
entree
,
but
if
you
decide
to
add
one
to
your
order
,
I
suggest
splitting
it
.
The
salad
is
large
enough
to
be
a
meal
for
some
folks
.
For
an
entree
,
I
highly
recommend
the
scampi
diavalio
.
It
's
a
heavenly
dish
with
campanelle
pasta
,
sausage
,
chicken
,
shrimp
,
bell
peppers
,
onions
,
and
olive
oil
.
There
are
also
some
red
pepper
flakes
to
add
a
spicy
kick
,
but
the
spice
is
definitely
not
overpowering
to
my
taste
.
Overall
,
this
is
a
wonderful
local
restaurant
with
a
cozy
,
friendly
atmosphere
and
great
food
.
I
highly
recommend
it.I
've
walked
past
the
Soup
Factory
numerous
times
on
my
way
into
Barriques
.
I
decided
to
finally
stop
in
yesterday
.
Now
,
as
you
can
guess
,
this
place
's
focus
is
...
SOUP
.
They
do
have
a
wide
selection
of
salads
and
sandwiches
-LRB-
both
hot
and
cold
-RRB-
.
I
decided
to
try
the
chicken
and
mushroom
stew
,
and
half
of
a
caprese
sandwich
.
I
really
like
it
when
I
have
the
half
sandwich
option
,
so
I
do
n't
feel
stuffed
to
the
brim
adding
a
soup
.
The
stew
was
really
good
,
almost
as
good
as
my
fave
at
Java
Cat
!
The
sandwich
was
decent
,
but
nothing
amazing
.
It
's
pretty
easy
to
smear
pesto
on
a
slice
of
bread
with
tomato
and
mozzarella
and
squeeze
it
on
a
griddle
!
I
'll
definitely
be
stopping
back
in
to
try
another
soup
this
fall/winter
!
The
soup
was
n't
bad
,
but
the
guy
who
was
serving
it
was
really
creepy
and
totally
ruined
the
entire
experience
.
Plus
,
they
were
out
of
my
first
and
second
choices
even
though
they
were
supposed
to
be
open
for
2
more
hours.I
did
n't
know
what
to
expect
from
The
Soup
Factory
,
but
I
liked
what
I
found
!
I
visited
around
noon
on
a
weekday
and
the
place
was
hopping
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
local
business
crowd
.
I
ordered
the
Cheesy
Caprese
sandwich
and
loved
it
.
I
sampled
some
of
the
soups
as
well
and
all
were
good
,
but
maybe
not
great
.
There
are
about
8
different
varieties
of
soup
to
choose
from
each
day
,
everything
from
different
chilis
to
stews
to
bisques
--
you
wo
n't
get
bored
.
And
a
regular
menu
of
salads
and
sandwiches
is
available
.
Friendly
,
hard-working
staff.I
've
gone
here
a
few
times
to
see
bands
.
It
's
alright
.
The
bar
is
fairly
large
,
and
they
have
volleyball
outside
.
I
've
never
been
impressed
with
the
barstaff
.
Not
exactly
running
up
to
greet
you
and
get
your
order
,
and
the
mixed
drinks
are
always
a
bit
off
.
I
've
never
had
any
of
the
food
,
but
I
've
heard
it
's
decent
.
I
will
go
here
again
if
there
's
a
band
I
want
to
see
-LRB-
because
it
's
only
a
few
blocks
from
home
-RRB-
,
but
you
'll
never
hear
me
say
``
Whadya
say
we
go
to
the
Tavern
for
a
night
of
fun
?!?!
``
The
Club
Tavern
is
an
interesting
bar
.
It
has
a
wide
range
of
crowd
members
from
the
youthful
to
the
middle
aged
.
I
've
been
to
this
bar
on
numerous
occasions
for
volleyball
,
and
hanging
out
.
and
for
most
times
its
been
a
pleasant
experience
.
The
drinks
are
fairly
priced
,
there
is
a
lot
of
space
so
you
do
n't
feel
crowded
and
usually
the
music
is
fair
.
Some
points
of
concern
though
arrive
with
smoking
.
When
will
they
make
it
a
state
wide
band
to
smoke
in
bars
and
restaurants
.
The
bartenders
also
seem
a
little
snobby
on
occasion
.
I
would
n't
say
this
is
the
bar
to
go
if
your
looking
to
have
a
great
night
but
if
you
want
a
fun/interesting
night
with
some
interesting
characters
make
sure
you
visit.The
wait
staff
were
non-existent
,
the
food
was
atrocious
,
the
mixed
drinks
were
n't
drinkable
,
and
the
atmosphere
was
filthy
.
What
more
can
I
say
?
Ick.A
quiet
bar
out
in
Middleton
,
it
's
certainly
not
the
worst
,
but
it
ai
n't
the
greatest
either
.
Having
now
played
2
sessions
of
their
``
intermediate
''
volleyball
leagues
,
I
'm
wishing
the
second
one
ended
sooner
.
They
need
to
drag
folks
in
,
so
they
make
you
play
,
come
hell
or
high
water
.
I
've
heard
rumors
of
sand
volleyball
...
in
the
snow
.
Maybe
I
'm
just
bitter
.
cold
.
The
food
is
nothing
worth
writing
home
about
.
The
sandwiches
are
pretty
standard
fare
and
nachos
are
decent
.
I
'm
a
sucker
for
seasoned
fries
and
they
're
pretty
decent
here
,
so
I
'll
add
another
star
.
Unfortunately
,
the
beer
is
n't
cheap
,
nor
were
there
other
obvious
specials
.
Look
around
and
find
somewhere
else
if
you
're
out
for
an
evening
of
drinking
.
The
TVs
are
n't
all
that
great
for
a
sports
bar
,
which
the
Club
Tavern
tries
to
achieve
,
as
far
as
I
can
tell
.
There
is
a
projector
and
large
screen
,
but
I
have
n't
seen
it
used.They
've
got
a
couple
of
pool
tables
and
dartboards
as
well
.
The
bartenders
are
n't
terrible
,
it
just
takes
some
time
for
them
to
warm
up
to
you
.
After
my
4th
or
5th
trip
there
-LRB-
again
,
because
of
the
volleyball
league
-RRB-
,
they
were
friendly
and
joking
around
with
the
crew.I
want
to
like
this
place
-
I
really
,
really
do
.
But
it
's
fairly
rundown
,
the
bar
staff
makes
you
feel
as
if
you
're
ruining
their
day
by
asking
for
a
drink
,
the
food
is
average
,
and
the
bathroom
conjures
memories
of
b-list
horror
movie
finales
.
I
've
spent
a
few
afternoons
here
watching
the
game
,
and
even
while
sitting
at
the
bar
and
tipping
well
with
every
drink
,
service
is
lackluster
at
best
.
I
've
had
their
breakfast
and
some
of
the
lunch
fare
-
meh
,
nothing
spectacular
by
any
means
.
Very
much
``
the
working
man
's
bar
,
''
and
I
appreciate
that
aspect
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
but
feel
like
I
'm
just
a
step
away
from
getting
jabbed
with
a
broken
bottle
or
otherwise
needing
a
tetanus
shot
whenever
I
stop
by
The
Club
Tavern
.
Middleton
has
better
bars
-
try
The
Midtown
Pub
or
Paul
's
Neighborhood
Bar
for
a
more
personable
and
less
sketchy
experience
.745
on
a
Friday
night
with
two
of
my
buddies
.
We
all
got
the
fish
fry
plus
some
deep
fried
shrimp
.
Service
was
attentive
,
but
everything
seemed
to
go
wrong
.
Out
of
sirloin
and
a
certain
beer
.
Forgot
to
give
us
the
soup
until
after
the
entree
arrived
.
Fish
was
average
for
the
price
,
I
could
n't
imagine
it
was
made
to
order
.
Cole
saw
sucked
,
it
was
soggy
lettuce
smothered
in
warm
mayonnaise.Fantastic
for
St

's
Day
-
I
've
been
looking
for
a
worthy
destination
since
Irish
Waters
closed
five
or
so
years
ago
,
and
have
finally
found
it
!
Great
meal
,
great
value
,
fantastic
,
speedy
service
and
perfect
atmosphere
.
Only
thing
lacking
is
the
quality
if
the
corned
beef
-
if
it
were
a
little
better
of
a
cut
,
I
'd
have
given
it
five
stars
.
Yum.Horrendously
managed
.
Terrible
service
.
Very
rude
and
the
managers
seem
to
treat
their
employees
with
no
respect
.
The
drinks
a
watery
and
the
tap
selection
is
average
.
Food
is
ok
but
not
worth
a
trip
over
to
this
joint
.
I
do
n't
recommend.I
dont
know
why
people
are
ripping
Club
Tavern
a
new
one
,
I
love
this
place
!!
The
drinks
are
cheap
;
I
've
purchased
vodka
tonics
for
$
3
and
top
shelf
for
$
4
!
Its
never
too
packed
and
the
bartenders
are
always
beyond
friendly
.
They
probably
also
have
the
best
bloody
mary
's
and
chaser
Ive
had
for
those
hair
of
the
dog
mornings
.
And
plus
they
have
a
slot
machine
there
that
pays
out
in
cash
,
you
cant
really
beat
that!Do
not
get
involved
in
their
Brewer
giveaway
nights
!
No
bartender
is
aware
of
promotion
or
rules
which
are
clearly
printed
on
posters
.
!
Wearing
Brewer
gear
a
requirement
to
win
tickets
and
jersey
.
Three
people
in
the
place
with
gear
on
,
not
one
of
those
won
!?
Hmmmm
...
...
When
asked
,
reply
was
Ben

-LSB-
10
seconds
after
game
concluded
.
.
-RSB-
.
.
Of
course
``
Ben
''
could
not
be
found
!
.
A
fraud
!
Doubt
anything
awarded!A
friend
proposed
Club
Tavern
for
fish
fry
.
None
of
us
had
ever
been
there
.
While
the
food
overall
wasnt
the
WORST
I
've
had
,
I
wouldnt
recommend
eating
there
unless
someone
buys
your
meal
for
you
,
or
youve
been
stranded
on
a
desert
island
for
5
years
and
this
is
the
first
``
real
''
meal
you
've
had
in
ages
.
To
some
,
it
may
make
you
want
to
go
back
to
the
island
...
atleast
food
is
fresh
.
We
arrived
10
mins
after
the
4
other
people
of
our
party
,
after
20
more
minutes
the
waiter
came
back
to
see
what
we
wanted
to
drink
.
Forgot
to
note
,
for
a
Friday
night
at
7:30
the
place
was
pretty
much
empty
in
the
dining
area
.
I
ordered
a
diet
pepsi
and
the
others
ordered
random
alcoholic
drinks
.
My
soda
was
flat
,
watery
and
had
some
kind
of
scum
on
top
of
it
.
I
thought
I
may
be
crazy
,
so
everyone
at
the
table
tried
the
soda
and
agreed
it
was
disgusting
.
Waiter
came
back
and
I
asked
for
a
diet
dew
instead
.
Received
a
diet
dew
that
tasted
a
little
less
flat
...
but
now
the
glass
had
a
leak
in
it
while
went
everywhere
.
Asked
for
a
glass
from
the
bar
w
diet
pepsi
.
It
seemed
a
little
less
flat
,
but
not
by
much
.
Atleast
that
glass
was
clean
.
Friend
ordered
the
hog
heaven
,
bloody
mary
with
bacon
infused
vodka
.
He
said
it
wasnt
the
worst
drink
,
but
mainly
tasted
like
greasy
bacon
fat
,
not
a
smokey
bacon
flavor
.
Didnt
try
it
myself
.
After
the
soda
ordeal
,
it
had
been
20
mins
since
we
arrived
I
ordered
some
Moo-skis
as
an
appetizer
,
which
are
listed
as
hashbrowns
covered
in
bacon
,
onion
,
and
cheese
from
what
i
remember
.
20
mins
after
that
waiter
came
back
to
take
our
order
.
I
gave
him
my
order
of
all
you
can
eat
fish
and
asked
about
the
appetizer
.
He
said
``
oh
ya
,
forgot
about
those
,
theyll
be
right
up
.
''
5
or
6
minutes
later
,
he
came
back
to
check
our
drink
status
,
and
said
``
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand
...
you
had
moo-skis
...
theyll
be
here
soon
.
''
5
or
6
mins
later
again
he
brought
out
the
moo-skis
.
They
were
hashbrowns
on
a
small
side
plate
with
a
small
layer
of
shredded
mozza
on
top
.
Very
plain
and
greasy
tasting
.
Realized
there
should
be
bacon
and
onion
...
which
i
found
tiiiiny
few
far
between
pieces
inside
hash
later
.
For
the
3
or
4
dollars
,
would
have
been
better
used
for
just
plain
hashbrowns
at
a
diner
for
a
dollar
.
Finally
get
the
all
you
can
eat
fish
which
had
2
pieces
of
pollock
,
beer
battered
fries
,
tartar
,
and
coleslaw
:
Fish
:
ok
sized
.
breading
was
hard
-LRB-
which
i
like
-RRB-
,
taste
ok
.
Not
worst
Ive
had
,
but
no
where
near
good
.
Fries
:
Were
best
part
of
the
meal
.
Tartar
:
Different
,
paprika
or
something
in
it
for
a
red
color
.
didnt
taste
any
dill
.
Coleslaw
:
Im
not
sure
you
could
even
call
this
slaw
.
It
was
literally
a
small
cup
of
mayo
,
with
maybe
2
tiny
forks
of
cabbage
.
Im
not
exaggerating
that
it
was
a
little
liquidy
...
it
was
literally
SOUP
.
Ordered
a
2nd
piece
of
fish
which
I
got
5
mins
later
w
more
tartar
.
We
were
still
eating
and
I
ordered
a
3rd
piece
of
fish
.
He
came
back
with
our
checks
after
10
mins
.
We
laughed
that
the
forgetting
of
the
fish
was
on
par
w
our
night
.
2
friends
paid
seperate
and
we
had
2
parties
of
2
.
Super
simple
orders
,
but
he
ended
up
bringing
the
bills
up
wrong
3
times
so
we
had
to
continue
to
correct
.
Had
to
take
our
payments
one
at
a
time
which
added
another
10
mins
.
Finishing
up
our
bills
...
...
and
kitchen
staff
brings
me
the
last
piece
of
fish
about
30
mins
after
ordering
it
and
when
we
were
getting
up
.
Maybe
it
was
a
one
time
bad
experience
,
but
considering
how
dead
it
was
on
a
friday
night
...
Im
guessing
our
experience
is
pretty
representative
of
the
food/wait
staff
which
is
a
shame
since
the
place
really
has
a
nice
flair
or
feel
inside
it
.
The
best
part
of
the
experience
was
the
upbeat
classic
80s
music
.
We
all
received
buy
one
get
one
coupons
upon
leaving
.
Not
sure
if
it
was
just
us
or
everyone
gets
them
.
30
mins
after
getting
home
,
I
spent
lots
of
time
in
the
bathroom
as
it
all
came
rushing
out
the
bottom
pipes
.
I
have
an
iron
stomach
and
do
n't
get
messed
up
by
much
.
girlfriend
edit
:
Reminded
me
she
didnt
get
the
salad
she
ordered
and
had
to
ask
.
Also
noted
her
old
fashioned
came
w
cherries
and
olives
in
it
,
which
is
taboo
?
Supposed
to
be
one
or
other
?
Im
a
crazy
WI
who
doesnt
order
many
OF
's
,
so
not
sure
about
this.I
used
to
love
stopping
by
this
place
on
Taco
Mondays
.
I
think
you
used
to
get
5
for
a
dollar
at
one
point
and
you
could
get
a
pitcher
of
spotted
cow
for
like
$
9
so
you
just
couldnt
beat
it
.
Slowly
they
started
upping
the
prices
etc.
.
I
think
they
must
have
gotten
a
new
fish
because
for
the
last
couple
years
its
had
a
metallic
taste
...
It
's
one
of
those
things
where
they
seem
to
have
chose
quantity
over
quality
.
.
Went
to
The
Club
this
morning
for
Sunday
brunch
-LRB-
which
we
normally
do
-RRB-
.
Usually
have
eggs/bacon/muffin
or
toast
but
today
splurged
on
French
toast
.
Was
VERY
good
-
Love
my
French
toast
crispy
and
this
totally
hit
the
spot
.
We
always
ask
for
our
bacon
crispy
,
and
today
's
was
no
exception
.
We
also
stopped
in
Wednesday
for
Bingo/Trivia
night
.
I
thought
I
was
good
on
trivia
,
but
Moose
came
up
with
stumpers
I
could
n't
even
find
on
my
phone
on
Google
-
but
others
got
them
.
We
had
burgers
that
night
and
they
were
great
.
Exactly
what
we
ordered
.
Even
the
onion
rings
were
hot
and
quite
tasty
.
Wait
staff
is
a
hoot
-
they
enjoy
shaking
things
up
with
different
songs
that
all
present
can
enjoy
-
who
does
n't
like
Muppets
doing
Queen
's
``
Bohemian
Rhapsody
''
??
They
're
all
very
accommodating
with
tv
channel
change
requests
,
please
turn
up/down
the
music
,
etc.
.
BEST
NIGHT
TO
GO
:
Badger
Band
Concert
Day
in
April
!
The
Club
gets
a
bus
for
Thursday
night
's
concert
and
you
are
fed
a
catered
dinner
prior
to
boarding
.
There
's
way
too
much
food
and
it
's
all
really
good
-
do
n't
get
me
started
on
the
Jambalaya
!
-
whole
thing
is
a
great
deal
.
My
husband
and
I
have
enjoyed
The
Club
for
years
...
and
will
continue
to.Not
my
favorite
live
music
venue
in
town
.
They
pull
in
good
local
acts
weekly
,
and
the
drinks
are
tasty
and
inexpensive
enough
,
but
it
's
a
bit
too
loud
to
enjoy
the
performances
without
blowing
out
an
eardrum
.
Do
stop-in
to
see
Moose
,
though
-
he
's
cool.When
I
go
to
the
Club
Tavern
,
it
's
a
little
bit
like
going
home
.
No
,
really
,
I
used
to
live
upstairs
.
I
would
n't
call
it
fine
dining
,
but
the
food
is
good
.
I
'm
a
big
fan
of
the
Moose
Burger
,
though
I
change
it
up
a
little
bit
.
It
comes
with
3
slices
of
cheese
,
ham
,
mushrooms
,
and
bbq
sauce
,
but
I
have
them
ditch
the
mushrooms
-LRB-
i
'm
allergic
-RRB-
and
add
bacon
and
a
fried
egg
,
because
i
LIKE
my
burgers
to
give
me
heart
palpitations
.
Monday
night
taco
nights
are
pretty
awesome
,
The
tacos
are
n't
anything
fancy
,
but
they
're
cheap
,
and
help
to
offset
the
copious
amounts
of
tap
beer
I
tend
to
imbibe
.
-LRB-
note
:
if
you
drink
it
straight
from
the
pitcher
,
it
still
counts
as
ONE
beer
-RRB-
Club
Tavern
also
offers
a
pretty
good
breakfast
,
and
they
have
specials
for
the
early
birds
.
Best
bloody
mary
in
town
,
-LRB-
except
mine
of
course
,
but
I
live
1000
miles
away
now
...
-RRB-
Happy
hour
at
the
Club
was
always
my
favorite
.
75
cent
pints
of
Miller
High
Life
.
Not
the
world
's
greatest
beer
,
but
definitely
affordable
during
happy
hour
.
I
always
like
to
visit
the
Club
when
I
get
back
to
town.New
kitchen
manager
is
making
some
great
food
these
days
!
AWESOME
fish
fry
on
Friday
night
.
Soup
is
outstanding
and
service
is
friendly
and
fast
,
and
fun
!
There
's
also
a
new
appetizer
on
the
menu
that
is
quite
tasty
-
spring
rolls
with
a
raspberry
sauce
and
a
cucumber/garlic
pepper
sauce
-
just
outstanding
!
Service
is
friendly
,
too!Quick
review
:
Family-run
breakfast/lunch
joint
with
your
typical
diner
staples
.
Quaint
and
cozy
,
lots
of
comfort
foods
.
Nothing
spectacular
,
though
the
homemade
breads
are
quite
good
.
A
bit
on
the
pricey
side
and
can
fill-up
with
people
quickly
,
especially
on
the
weekends
.
Detailed
review
:
I
've
lived
near
C
's
for
about
a
year
now
,
and
have
never
stopped-in
to
check
it
out
.
Folks
at
work
gave
mixed
reviews
-
some
raved
about
the
place
,
others
gave
it
a
``
Meh
.
''
I
run
past
it
nearly
every
morning
and
they
always
seem
to
have
a
good-sized
crowd
,
especially
on
Saturdays
and
Sundays
,
so
I
figured
it
had
to
be
somewhat
decent
...
with
that
,
I
treated
myself
to
a
breakfast
this
morning
.
I
wandered
in
at
around
9:30
am
on
Memorial
Day
and
was
pleased
to
find
plenty
of
seating
.
The
hostess
offered
me
a
table
outside
,
which
was
a
nice
bonus
-
the
weather
was
gorgeous
,
so
I
happily
took
the
offer
.
I
also
grabbed
one
of
their
complimentary/shared
newspapers
to
read
.
A
waitress
stopped
by
to
ask
for
my
drink
order
-
I
went
with
coffee
-
and
to
drop
off
a
menu
.
She
came
back
a
few
minutes
later
with
an
acrylic
coffee
cup
and
a
stainless
coffee
carafe
.
She
left
to
tend
to
another
table
;
I
needed
some
cream
for
the
coffee
...
oh
well
,
it
was
nice
and
I
was
happy
to
continue
browsing
the
menu
,
sans
cream
for
my
coffee
.
Breakfast
offerings
were
ordinary
:
eggs
,
hashbrowns
,
pancakes
,
omelets
,
skillets
,
and
a
couple
of
extras
,
like
eggs
benedict
,
belgian
waffles
,
and
some
homemade
pastries
-LRB-
turnovers
,
donuts
,
muffins
,
cookies
,
etc
-RRB-
.
The
waitress
stopped
by
to
ask
if
I
was
ready
to
order
-
told
her
I
decided
on
the
``
Hen
's
Nest
''
which
consisted
of
2
eggs
,
hashbrowns
,
and
toast
.
I
also
ordered
a
pancake
,
and
requested
some
cream
for
the
coffee
.
She
apologized
and
immediately
brought
some
half-n-half
containers
.
We
were
in
business
.
Before
leaving
to
take
my
order
to
the
kitchen
,
she
asked
if
I
'd
like
anything
in
the
hashbrowns
.
I
was
pleased
!
C
's
has
some
specialty
hashbrown
items
on
the
menu
,
but
I
did
n't
want
to
order
a
huge
plate
of
them
...
so
,
when
the
offer
surfaced
to
add
onions
,
peppers
,
tomatoes
,
etc
to
my
potatoes
,
I
jumped
at
the
chance
.
Food
came
about
20
minutes
later
and
looked
tasty
.
The
pancake
was
a
lot
thinner
than
I
had
pictured
,
but
it
was
quite
tasty
.
I
found
myself
wishing
I
had
ordered
2
.
The
Hen
's
Nest
was
just
``
OK
''
-
the
hashbrowns
were
n't
greasy
and
featured
a
nice
,
crispy
char
,
but
the
onions
and
peppers
did
n't
do
much
for
flavor
,
oddly
enough
...
I
found
the
entire
dish
to
be
largely
flavorless
.
:--LRB-
The
multigrain
toast
was
very
good
-
and
was
probably
the
star
of
the
entire
meal
.
The
waitress
only
stopped
by
once
more
-
to
drop
off
the
check
,
which
was
a
bit
of
a
shocker
as
well
...
$

for
my
modest
breakfast

5.99
for
the
Hen

For
what
it

I
think
the
Hubbard
Avenue
Diner
has
a
better
overall
breakfast
,
and
it
's
about
1/2
the
price
.
It
'll
probably
be
a

before
I

C
's
again
.5
stars
for
food
and
service
.
The
atmosphere
and
decor
could
use
some
help
--
the
interior
is
clean
and
neat
,
but
dated
.
The
outside/exterior
ca
n't
be
helping
business
--
if
you
can
get
past
the
stark
white
exterior
walls
,
the
green
roof
line
,
and
the
nondescript
sign
,
you
'll
be
treated
to
a
good
,
``
from
scratch
''
meal
that
tastes
homemade
,
with
excellent/friendly
service
.
This
is
a
great
place
for
breakfast.So
there
I
was
,
with
a
soaking
wet
tent
and
on
my
way
to
the
National
Mustard
Museum
.
But
hey
,
hard-core
mustard
fan
as
I
am
,
I
know
better
than
to
start
the
day
with
all-you-can-sample-mustard
,
right
?
So
the
BF
and
I
surfed
Yelp
to
find
a
decent
breakfast
stop
and
Lo
,
right
down
the
street
from
our
campground
was
C
's
,
so
we
figured
we
'd
stop
in
.
Now
,
it
was
Father
's
Day
,
which
we
realized
when
we
walked
in
,
cause
the
place
was
packed
.
It
's
pretty
much
your
standard
breakfast
food
,
with
some
specialty
bakery
fare
.
Clean
,
tasty
and
fairly
reasonably
priced
.
It
is
not
a
huge
place
either
,
but
there
was
PLENTY
of
waitstaff
to
keep
things
moving
.
I
had
the
skillet
breakfast
,
which
I
was
very
pleased
to
find
had
the
option
of
turkey
.
-LRB-
This
made
me
happy
,
as
I
like
meat
at
breakfast
after
a
night
of
rainy
camping
,
but
am
allergic
to
pork
.
-RRB-
The
skillet
had
turkey
,
potatoes
,
onions
and
green
peppers
mixed
together
,
with
toast
and
2
eggs
on
top
.
The
eggs
were
perfect
,
which
impressed
me
,
given
how
crazy
busy
the
place
was
.
I
do
have
one
complaint
about
my
food
`
tho
,
the
onions
,
peppers
and
potatoes
were
not
cooked
enough
for
my
taste
.
In
fact
,
the
onions
were
damn
near
raw
.
Luckily
,
they
were
finely
shredded
,
so
it
was
n't
too
bad
,
but
I
take
away
a
star
for
that
.
-LRB-
BF
says
his
potatoes
were
underdone
too
.
Not
raw
,
but
not
quite
done
enough
.
-RRB-
Waitstaff
was
very
good
about
keeping
coffee
filled
.
And
,
since
it
was
a
bakery
,
we
HAD
to
at
least
try
a
cinnamon
roll
.
It
was
a
good
roll
,
and
they
even
warmed
it
up
for
us
.
I
noticed
that
they
had
a
LOT
of
baked
goods
specializing
with
Strawberry
and
Rhubarb
,
which
is
in
season
right
now
.
To
me
that
's
a
good
thing
,
even
though
I
'm
not
big
on
rhubarb
.
Tends
to
indicate
a
reliance
on
seasonal
-LRB-
and
hopefully
locally
grown
-RRB-
produce
.
It
being
Father
's
day
,
they
had
a
special
on
Steak
and
Eggs
and
a
fresh
berry
topped
waffle
special
too
.
Dads
got
a
HUGE
complimentary
chocolate-covered
strawberry
,
which
I
thought
was
nice
.
Oh
yeah
,
the
eggs
with
Hollendaise
sauce
looked
and
smelled
really
good
...
We
tried
C
's
for
breakfast
over
the
4th
of
July
weekend
.
Upon
entering
,
it
is
obvious
that
this
is
a
no-frills
family-style
restaurant
.
Pretty
much
gives
that
``
small
town
''
feel
,
which
is
n't
bad
by
any
means
.
Our
dishes
were
standard
.
Not
bad
,
but
nothing
great
.
Service
was
lackluster
,
even
if
it
was
pretty
busy
...
This
place
does
look
to
have
an
AMAZING
baked
goods
section
.
Tons
of
pastries
,
cookies
,
and
muffins
.
Plus
,
all
of
the
breads
are
made
in-house
-LRB-
my
darling
dear
said
his
toast
was
top
notch
-RRB-
.
Next
time
we
stop
in
,
I
'll
be
skipping
the
menu
,
and
snatching
something
out
of
the
bakery
case.C
's
is
a
FANTASTIC
place
for
breakfast
.
Family
owned
,
this
restaurant
makes
all
the
breads
,
buns
,
pies
,
and
bakery
in
house
.
I
had
the
eggs
benedict
and
was
pleased
to
be
given
a
choice
of
ham
or
turkey
,
but
of
course
I
had
to
try
the
more
traditional
ham
.
I
also
made
my
hashbrowns
``
C
's
hashbrowns
''
by
adding
cheddar
cheese
and
onions
.
The
eggs
benedict
was
delicious
,
the
hollandaise
sauce
was
also
homemade
and
was
the
best
I
have
ever
had
and
the
freshly
thick
shredded
hashbrowns
were
very
tasty
and
not
greasy
!
C
's
was
busy
on
this
Sunday
morning
,
but
the
service
was
quick
,
friendly
,
and
delightful
.
C
's
has
quickly
become
a
favorite
for
Sunday
breakfast.I
would
love
to
give
this
place
4.5
,
it
is
very
friendly
and
inviting
.
They
serve
fresh
baked
toasted
bread
with
the
breakfast
items
,
try
the
sourdough
or
rye
.
They
give
you
a
nice
sized
portion
and
they
quick
,
not
rushed
.
The
place
is
always
busy
which
is
a
good
sign
in
my
opinion
.
Ihave
never
had
to
wait
more
then
a
couple
of
minutes
for
a
table
and
if
push
comes
to
shove
there
is
a
small
counter
.
There
is
seating
outdoors
for
the
nicer
days
and
they
are
constently
changing
the
decorations
to
the
season
or
athletic
event
.
I
keep
coming
back
and
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
.
If
you
like
tabasco
withyour
meal
you
might
want
to
bring
your
own
as
they
will
bring
out
a
botle
but
it
is
the
habanero
type
.
It
may
be
to
hot
for
some
palettes.I
first
heard
of
C
's
from
a
review
in
77
Square
or
some
such
thing
and
thought
I
'd
try
it
.
I
've
NEVER
had
a
bad
dish
there
.
The
bread
for
french
toast
is
made
in
the
restaurant
-
not
pre-made
and
heated
up
,
not
store
made
bread
,
but
real
home
made
stuff
.
The
belguim
waffles
are
fresh
-
not
the
frozen-then-heated-up
kind
.
Egg
dishes
are
wonderful
-
lots
of
everything
in
the
omelets
,
etc.
.
The
staff
is
really
friendly
and
service
,
yes
,
can
be
a
bit
slow
,
but
they
are
ALWAYS
hopping
!
I
give
them
a
break
because
of
that
...
I
took
the
bf
there
for
the
first
time
on
a
Badger
football
Saturday
and
now
I
ca
n't
go
anywhere
else
!!
:
-RRB-
Portions
are
huge
-LRB-
often
have
a
box
to
go
-RRB-
and
as
others
have
mentioned
,
the
bakery
is
amazing
:
-RRB-
Ya
Got
ta
Try
It
!!
If
asked
a
few
months
ago
,
I
would
have
given
them
4
stars
.
Their
breakfasts
are
awesome
and
homemade
which
is
great
,
but
they
have
a
no
substitution
policy
that
knocks
them
down
a
notch
.
My
husband
does
n't
eat
eggs
,
and
they
refuse
to
give
him
extra
hash
browns
,
or
at
least
take
off
the
price
of
eggs
.
But
it
does
have
a
great
environment
and
they
're
otherwise
friendly.If
you
're
ever
looking
for
a
delicious
breakfast
on
the
west
side
of
Madison
,
this
is
the
place
to
go
.
My
husband
and
I
were
saying
on
the
west
side
,
but
did
n't
want
to
pay
the
$
20
surcharge
at
our
hotel
for
meh
hotel
breakfast
.
Instead
,
we
looked
around
at
our
options
,
and
found
that
C
's
was
highly
rated
for
breakfast
,
and
not
too
far
away
.
-LRB-
Best
of
all
,
it
was
about
5
minutes
away
from
our
morning
destination
,
I
'm
Board
!
-RRB-
The
first
day
we
came
here
,
we
sat
outside
.
-LRB-
The
gramma/farm
decor
kind
of
threw
me
off
.
-RRB-
I
had
the
blueberry
pancakes
with
a
side
of
hashbrowns
and
coffee
,
and
my
husband
had
an
omlette
with
ham
,
onions
,
and
cheddar
&
toast
.
Delicious
-
I
do
n't
know
the
last
time
I
had
such
wonderful
food
when
eating
out
.
Even
the
coffee
-LRB-
and
his
pepsi
!
-RRB-
were
great
.
They
hit
it
out
of
the
park
so
hard
that
we
decided
to
come
back
on
Sunday
rather
than
heading
downtown
to
another
place
for
brunch
that
we
found
.
Sunday
's
breakfast
,
my
husband
had
a
repeat
of
Saturday
's
,
and
I
had
one
of
their
specials
-
a
chocolate/banana
muffin
,
eggs
,
hashbrowns
,
and
bacon
.
It
was
also
tasty
.
If
I
had
to
complain
about
anything
,
it
'd
be
that
C
's
is
too
far
away
for
me
to
enjoy
regularly
:
-RRB-
Update
-
this
was
the
fourth
or
fifth
visit
to
C
's
over
the
past
few
years
;
my
coworkers
have
a
breakfast
club
where
we
frequent
various
places
once
a
month
or
so
.
The
breakfast
grub
is
straight-forward
,
no-nonsense
,
standard
fare
.
Think
:
eggs
,
bacon
,
hash
browns
,
pancakes
,
and
skillets
.
Filling
and
satisfying
.
The
breads
remain
excellent
,
as
are
the
bakery
items
.
I
've
bumped
it
up
a
star
from
the
earlier
review
because
the
service
has
been
stellar
with
our
past
few
visits
.
The
waitstaff
is
friendly
,
attentive
,
and
fast
.
We
've
never
waited
for
a
refill
of
coffee
or
water
-
they
're
on
it
right
away.Solid
spot
for
diner
breakfast
fare
in
Middleton
--
popular
with
the
grandma
and
grandpa
set
.
Like
all
good
diners
,
service
is
friendly
,
they
keep
the
coffee
cup
full
,
and
know
how
to
crank
through
tables
.
They
've
always
been
busy
when
we
've
been
there
-LRB-
weekend
mornings
-RRB-
but
even
when
the
wait
looks
long
it
's
less
than
10
minutes
--
and
once
you
're
seated
,
service
is
quick
.
Breakfasts
are
definitely
of
the
``
this
is
not
healthy
for
you
''
variety
,
but
it
's
good
for
a
treat
-LRB-
I
do
n't
know
how
my
kid
made
it
through
his
cinnamon-swirl
pancakes
which
were
topped
with
the
kind
of
glaze
you
put
on
cinnamon
rolls
,
especially
after
he
added
syrup
to
it
...
-RRB-
I
was
actually
a
bit
disappointed
by
my
latest
experience
at
C
's
.
I
've
had
better
.
Typically
I
would
give
it
a
3-star
but
some
of
the
service
was
n't
the
greatest
and
my
food
was
cold
...
C
's
is
the
kind
of
family-friendly
experience
that
makes
it
a
3
to
4
star
restaurant
on
a
good
day
,
but
on
this
particular
day
,
our
primary
server
was
impatient
and
lacked
a
customer-first
attitude
and
the
quality
of
food
was
lacking
.
However
,
the
service
for
a
never
less
then
half
empty
coffee
mug
,
was
superb
.
I
do
love
the
bakery
items
so
could
n't
resist
the
pecan
roll
,
but
my
egg
sandwich
with
hash
browns
could
have
been
better
.
The
hash
browns
were
cold
and
the
croissant
was
dry
.
The
bacon
however
,
crispy
,
just
like
I
requested
.
But
,
I
was
with
my
family
,
we
were
tucked
in
a
cozy
corner
booth
,
had
great
conversation
and
due
to
the
history
of
this
restaurant
and
the
many
times
I
've
been
there
before
,
it
would
be
a
place
I
would
recommend
.
I
guess
the
day
I
was
there
was
just
an
``
off
day
''
.
That
happens.My
favorite
breakfast
place
in
Madison
,
without
question
.
Small
town
diner
fare
,
but
they
bake
their
own
bread
and
pastries
.
Great
service
and
very
affordable
.
I
come
here
as
often
as
I
can.I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
about
this
place
,
but
they
are
slooooooooow
.
The
food
is
adequate
-LRB-
please
do
n't
lecture
me
about
fast
food
,
why
are
you
even
reading
this
review
?
-RRB-
,
but
sitting
at
the
drive-in
will
shorten
your
life
.
Or
maybe
just
feel
like
it
.
I
prefer
some
of
their
stuff
to
McDonald
's
-LRB-
yes
,
I
'm
very
discerning
-RRB-
but
just
can
not
abide
the
wait.It
's
a
Burger
King
.
My
expectations
were
not
that
high
.
However
,
they
are
unbearably
slow
,
and
the
dining
area
is
usually
pretty
dirty
.
The
food
is
mediocre
,
even
for
fast
foot
's
low
standards
.
The
staff
usually
acts
like
you
're
ruining
their
day
for
showing
up.Good
bk
food
.
Slow
service
.
Drive
through
is
a
10
min
stop
even
if
your
the
only
one
in
line
.
Always
feels
like
i
am
bugging
the
person
at
the
window.It
's
called
fast
food
.
Not
wait
for
three
hours
for
a
fricking
burger
food
.
WTF
how
hard
is
it
honestly?I
have
given
this
burger
king
a
chance
MANY
times
...
But
they
are
BY
FAR
the
slowest
burger
king
I
have
EVER
been
to
...
Even
if
they
have
no
customers
inside
,
and
you
go
through
the
empty
drive
through
,
they
will
STILL
make
you
pull
forward
and
wait
for
your
meal
,
one
time
it
was
over
a
half
hour
!
Absolutely
unreasonable.I
would
give
this
BK
a
-1
star
if
I
could
.
They
just
recently
renovated
their
building
,
cool
,
looks
nice
.
I
've
stopped
going
to
this
location
,
it
is
the
worst
in
fast
food
.
Once
i
was
told
in
the
drive-thru
that
they
were
out
of
meat
,
but
had
chicken
or
fish
.
LOL
Seriously
!
The
king
of
burgers
out
of
meat
!?!?!?
The
wait
in
the
drive-thru
is
painfully
SLOW
!
I
once
ordered
,
waited
for
like
10-15
minutes
,
got
fed
up
and
left
.
Drove
over
to
Wendy
's
,
got
my
food
and
drove
past
BK
on
the
way
home
.
The
truck
i
was
behind
in
the
drive-thru
was
still
in
the
same
spot
!
Crazy
.
This
BK
NEEDS
better
management
and
training
for
the
employees
.
They
just
do
n't
seem
to
care
.
AVOID
AT
ALL
COSTS!Update
:
8/26/12
8:30
A.M.
Hangover
.
Ordered
2
Whoppers
w/o
cheese
and
1
Whopper
w
/
cheese
and
1
order
of
onion
rings
.
Drive-thru
.
Had
to
pull
ahead
and
wait
.
21
minutes
later
,
a
woman
in
a
purple
velvet
one
piece
delivered
our
food
.
Do
n't
they
have
work
uniforms
here
?
Jeeez.Having
won
a
free
small
frapee
from
the
``
Family
Food
''
giveaway
at
another
Burger
King
,
I
decided
to
go
inside
the
Sun
Prairie
location
to
cash
it
in
.
This
was
after
I
waited
for
almost
twenty
minutes
at
the
drive-through
,
even
after
the
order
taker
told
me
she
'd
be
with
me
in
,
``
just
a
second
.
''
Inside
the
lobby
,
I
was
met
by
a
scene
of
dirty
tables
,
slow
service
,
and
a
floor
littered
with
a
surprising
ammount
of
plastic
gloves
.
When
I
finally
made
it
to
the
counter
,
I
was
amazed
to
learn
that
it
is
somehow
possible
to
take
my
order
without
saying
a
single
word
to
me
,
and
then
simply
walking
away
without
even
handing
me
a
reciept
.
Perhaps
it
was
this
same
top-notch
service
and
accuracy
that
caused
another
customer
there
to
have
to
come
back
not
once
,
not
twice
,
but
THREE
times
because
they
made
his
food
wrong
.
At
this
point
,
my
instincts
said
to
leave
,
but
my
honor
required
that
I
stick
with
it
to
the
bitter
end
.
But
when
I
finally
got
the
free
frapee
,
I
was
saddened
to
say
that
it
was
not
worth
the
wait
.
If
you
value
your
ability
to
eat
at
Burger
King
more
than
your
time
,
I
would
suggest
staying
in
your
car
at
this
location
and
living
in
blissful
ignorance
.
As
for
me
,
it
'll
be
a
while
before
I
have
it
my
way
again
.22
minutes
to
get
my
order
.
Terrible
service
!
I
was
the
only
one
in
the
store
when
I
placed
my
order
although
there
were
3
cars
in
drivethru
.
Not
acceptable
!
The
only
thing
keeping
this
from
getting
a
1-star
review
is
that
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
the
restaurant
was
clean
and
newly
remodeled
,
and
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
they
did
get
the
order
accurate
...
again
,
after
22
minutes
...
not
acceptable!Have
been
there
several
times
and
it
's
always
super
slow
.
It
had
been
months
since
we
had
gone
there
so
today
we
went
there
and
the
girl
at
the
counter
just
finished
a
counter
order
,
saw
us
,
and
went
to
drive
through
.
We
stood
there
for
15
minutes
waiting
for
somebody
to
take
our
order
.
Fed
up
,
we
left
and
went
to
Culver
's
.
Unless
you
like
being
ignored
,
Avoid
,
Avoid
,
Avoid
!
Stopped
in
for
lunch
today
and
the
place
was
pretty
much
empty
.
There
was
a
lady
waiting
at
the
counter
for
her
order
,
two
gentlemen
who
already
had
their
order
and
were
seated
and
eating
.
There
was
one
worker
for
the
front
counter
and
the
drive
thru
and
2
or
3
workers
in
the
back
.
Waited
over
10
minutes
for
someone
to
take
my
order
and
was
n't
even
acknowledged
in
that
time
.
One
of
the
guys
came
up
front
to
bag
drive
thru
orders
,
wiped
the
sweat
off
his
face
with
a
napkin
,
crumpled
it
up
,
tossed
it
in
the
trash
and
then
scooped
up
fries
without
washing
his
hands
.
At
that
point
I
walked
out
and
went
to
Culvers
where
I
ordered
and
got
my
food
in
less
time
than
I
spent
waiting
to
order
here
.
Not
even
worth
one
star!I
went
through
the
drive
through
,
with
about
4
cars
ahead
of
me
.
After
placing
my
order
,
it
took
about
15
minutes
just
to
get
to
the
window
,
where
I
then
waited
28
minutes
being
ignored
!
I
know
the
exact
time
because
I
looked
at
the
time
stamp
on
my
receipt
!
There
were
at
least
three
cars
waiting
behind
me
too
!
I
finally
got
the
attention
of
the
lady
inside
to
see
what
the
problem
was
,
and
I
was
just
told
that
they
are
``
short
staffed
''
and
they
make
the
food
fresh
to
order
,
Which
I
guess
means
they
go
out
back
and
wait
for
the
chickens
to
mature
,
slaughter
them
,
and
THEN
make
the
nuggets
!
I
asked
for
a
manager
,
when
she
finally
showed
up
,
I
was
not
given
an
apology
,
just
the
same
story
of
being
short
staffed
.
At
this
point
I
had
asked
to
just
have
my
money
back
so
that
I
could
go
elsewhere
-LRB-
still
no
food
-RRB-
and
I
was
told
by
said
manager
that
she
does
n't
know
how
to
do
that
...
so
I
waited
...
and
finally
-LRB-
28
minutes
later
-RRB-
got
my
food
,
which
was
cold
,
and
my
milkshake
had
long
since
melted
.
Waste
of
my
time
and
money
!
I
did
get
a
phone
number
also
for
what
I
was
told
the
general
manager
,
called
,
it
was
a
cell
phone
with
no
name
on
the
voicemail
,
left
a
message
anyway
,
no
return
call
.
I
wo
n't
ever
be
back
,
and
I
do
n't
think
they
even
care!Remember
when
Burger
King
was
actually
somewhat
decent
?
Pepperidge
Farm
remembers
...
I
have
dined
with
the
King
many
a
time
across
this
fine
land
.
I
have
watched
their
slow
decline
with
sadness
over
the
last
thirty
years
.
At
one
point
,
they
actually
challenged
the
Clown
for
burger
superiority
,
but
now
,
they
're
a
weak
shadow
on
the
market
,
barely
a
player
...
...
and
the
BK
at
this
location
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
.
EVERYTHING
at
this
BK
takes
ten
minutes
.
Does
n't
matter
what
you
order
,
be
prepared
to
wait
.
It
's
always
dirty
.
When
I
was
a
kid
and
worked
at
the
Clown
,
we
were
always
cleaning
.
There
was
usually
one
or
two
people
on
any
shift
whose
sole
job
was
to
keep
the
lobby
clean
.
This
place
is
a
hole
.
Why
does
the
food
taste
weird
?
If
I
want
BK
,
I
actually
make
the
drive
to
Deforest
,
rather
than
eat
at
this
location
,
which
is
actually
a
stone
's
throw
from
my
house
.
The
food
here
tastes
bad
,
bleachy
,
and
wrong
.
What
are
they
doing
to
the
food
?
Fix
thyself
,
King
,
and
maybe
I
'll
return
.
Until
then
,
I
will
take
my
cheap
,
poorly
constructed
eats
elsewhere.This
place
is
slow
beyond
belief
.
How
do
they
stay
in
business
?
I
waited
15
min
for
my
order
which
was
wrong
and
cold
.
I
got
the
excuse
``
were
short
staffed
''
.
There
were
two
cars
in
line
and
no
one
in
the
dining
area
.
How
much
staff
do
you
need
for
two
customers
?
I
think
they
laugh
about
how
bad
they
are
as
workers
.
Because
they
could
care
less
...
Pretty
ok
pizza
dudes
.
Not
the
best
location
,
just
off
Main
street
,
they
share
a
tiny
building
with
Country
Hearth
bread
store
,
and
a
new
gyro
place
.
Teeny
tiny
parking
lot
.
That
is
all.Wow
.
What
a
bunch
of
stoners.I
had
mentioned
in
a
separate
review
that
,
per
the
website
,
this
Pizza
Pit
does
n't
have
mac-and-cheese
pizza
.
Well
,
I
went
to
get
some
gyros
-LRB-
they
have
a
mini
greek
restaurant
inside
,
apparently
,
called
Athens
-RRB-
and
saw
on
the
board
that
they
DO
have
the
mac/cheese
pizza
.
I
stand
corrected
.
On
to
the
gyros
.
The
actual
Greek
restaurant
in
town
is
closed
on
Mondays
,
so
we
came
here
for
our
fix
.
We
got
gyros
only
,
no
fries
-LRB-
there
are
n't
a
lot
of
options
,
that
might
be
it
right
there
-RRB-
.
They
come
with
tomatoes
and
onions
-
I
requested
mine
without
onions
.
They
were
fine
.
Not
stellar
,
not
terrible
.
I
've
had
better
ones
at
a
lot
of
places
,
but
considering
that
I
only
had
to
drive
ten
minutes
to
get
these
,
they
were
good
enough
.
I
was
told
15
minutes
,
and
when
I
got
there
15
minutes
-LRB-
or
so
-RRB-
later
they
were
ready
to
go
but
still
warm
once
I
got
them
home
and
started
devouring.What
has
the
world
done
to
the
people
in
this
place
to
make
them
hate
life
as
they
do
?
And
why
does
that
translate
to
the
mediocre
food
?
You
can
do
better
for
pizza
.
Hell
,
practically
across
the
street
from
this
place
is
Salvatore
's
.
You
'll
spend
a
bit
more
,
but
it
'll
be
worth
it
.
This
place
slaps
grease
and
cheese
on
cardboard
,
wraps
it
cardboard
,
and
hands
it
to
you
with
a
look
on
their
face
that
plainly
says
,
``
I
should
have
listened
to
my
teachers
in
high
school
.
``
I
think
their
delivery
service
is
pretty
good
,
it
was
quick
and
the
delivery
guy
was
friendly
.
And
the
lady
I
ordered
my
pizza
through
was
VERY
friendly
and
upbeat
.
I
've
heard
a
lot
of
bad
things
about
their
workers
?
But
I
always
go
around
noon
so
maybe
those
people
are
just
going
at
the
wrong
time
.
Who
knows
!
Now
onto
the
food
.
Their
pizza
is
n't
the
best
pizza
you
'll
ever
have
,
but
for
the
price
it
's
good
.
It
's
a
little
greasy
sometimes
,
I
'll
admit
.
But
honestly
I
get
the
craving
for
them
sometime
!
They
have
great
cheese
to
put
on
their
pizzas
,
and
they
usually
put
a
good
amount
on
.
And
I
love
their
breadsticks
!
Yum
!
Like
I
said
though
,
there
is
better
.
But
if
you
're
looking
for
cheap
,
quick
,
decent
pizza
I
'd
go
here.I
wanted
pizza
and
my
kids
wanted
macaroni
and
cheese
,
so
I
figured
I
'd
head
to
the
Pit
.
If
only
somebody
had
answered
the
phone
!
It
was
around
6pm
on
a
Saturday
night
,
which
I
understand
is
a
busy
time
,
but
come
on
.
I
let
it
ring
about
15
times
and
then
hung
up
.
I
paced
around
my
house
for
a
few
minutes
,
got
distracted
,
then
tried
calling
again
about
ten
minutes
later
.
Same
deal
:
lots
of
ringing
,
no
answering
.
I
let
it
ring
another
15
times
or
so
and
just
gave
up
.
I
do
n't
mind
having
someone
answer
and
then
immediately
put
me
on
hold
.
It
's
a
lot
better
than
the
nothing
that
I
got
.
Thumbs
DOWN.Always
good
,
friendly
,
and
hot
.
My
family
likes
this
``
Chinese
''
best
in
Sun
Prairie
.
The
food
is
even
better
of
you
eat
it
``
in
''
.
Never
full
of
customers
-LRB-
is
that
good
?
-RRB-
,
it
seems
like
they
do
a
lot
of
take-out
business
.
There
is
delivery
.
Not
much
updated
decor
.
Good
for
when
you
want
local
basic
Amer/Asian
,
same
menu
as
all
the
rest
.
Some
days
it
's
better
than
others
,
but
never
bad.I
ate
there
2
times
.
I
recommend
sea
food
soup
,
spicy
salty
shrimp
,
Singapore
rice
noodle
.
The
location
is
not
that
good
.
It
's
in
Sun
Prairie
,
a
suburb
area
from
Madison
,
WI
.
I
believe
if
the
location
is
in
downtown
Madison
,
it
would
be
one
of
the
top
Chinese
restaurant
in
Madison.Panda
Garden
is
the
best
place
to
get
Chinese
food
in
Sun
Prairie
.
And
they
deliver
which
is
a
plus
in
my
book
!
I
've
eaten
in
the
restaurant
a
couple
of
times
,
but
usually
do
take
out
.
I
've
never
had
anything
I
did
n't
like
there
-LRB-
and
we
've
tried
a
very
good
array
of
items
-RRB-
.
Tonight
we
had
the
Garlic
Shrimp
and
Chicken
Lo
Mein
.
Both
were
awesome
!
The
Garlic
Shrimp
had
a
nice
spicy
kick
to
it
,
but
still
had
a
TON
of
flavor
!
The
crab
Rangoon
and
pot
stickers
are
also
tasty
!
Pricing
is
very
reasonable
for
what
you
get!I
love
this
place
.
The
fried
dumplings
are
to
die
for.Easy
on-line
menu
,
great
selection
and
fabulous
food
.
I
ordered
hot
/
sour
soup
,
egg
roll
and
chicken
/
broccoli
.
All
of
it
was
great
.
I
ca
n't
wait
to
go
back.Every
time
my
boyfriend
and
I
eat
here
,
it
has
been
great
.
We
really
enjoy
the
steamed
dumplings
and
hot
and
sour
soup
.
The
staff
is
very
friendly
,
too.I
was
unhappy
due
to
having
to
wait
55
minutes
for
my
one
meal
-LRB-
steamed
veggies
combo
with
chicken
,
shrimp
and
scallops
!
Then
I
get
two
pieces
of
shrimp
,
three
small
slices
of
chicken
a
few
tiny
scallops
!!
For
$
12.00
that
is
a
rip
off
,
a
joke
and
unacceptable
!
You
going
to
charge
for
food
with
those
items
in
you
better
put
more
than
sliced
veggies
!!
I
will
never
come
back!This
is
take
out
only
.
They
have
at
least
two
locations
that
I
am
aware
of
.
One
in
Sun
Prairie
and
one
in
Fitchburg
.
They
have
excellent
Chinese
food
and
the
prices
are
pretty
good.Best
chinese
I
've
found
so
far
.
Hot
and
sour
soup
and
their
won
ton
soup
are
fantastic
.
Sometimes
I
'll
go
and
just
get
the
soup.I
have
n't
had
better
Crab
Rangoon
than
they
serve
here
.
The
people
who
work
there
are
pretty
nice
,
too.The
general
tso
's
and
boneless
spare
ribs
are
about
as
good
as
you
'll
find
.
No
lie!Meh
.
It
's
okay
when
you
want
something
quick
.
Not
overly
impressed
.
Fried
rice
is
good.Pretty
bland
for
Chinese
take
out.We
used
to
go
here
for
our
Americanized
Chinese
food
every
so
often
for
the
last
7
years
.
However
,
in
the
last
year
the
quality
of
their
food
has
taken
a
nose
dive
to
unacceptable
levels
of
blech
and
blah.The
rice
and
steamed
vegetables
were
good
,
but
that
's
about
all
we
could
tolerate
.
We
ordered
General
Tso
's
,
which
is
what
we
always
get
when
we
first
try
a
Chinese
restaurant
.
It
helps
us
compare
to
other
places.The
quality
of
the
chicken
used
was
awful
.
The
dumplings
were
flavorless
.
We
will
not
be
returning.Awesome
place
to
go
.
Their
motto
says
it
all
,
``
little
place
,
big
flavors
''
or
something
like
that
.
It
's
just
really
really
good.Food
is
insanely
good
.
Fresh
meats
and
very
,
very
tasty
.
When
you
order
a
sandwich
-LRB-
i
recommend
the
godfather
I
or
II
-RRB-
,
the
owner
goes
to
the
fridge
and
begins
slicing
cuts
for
your
sub
.
Does
n't
get
much
fresher
than
that
.
They
have
a
few
tables
,
but
I
've
never
eaten
there
so
I
can
not
comment
on
the
service
but
they
are
always
friendly
when
I
order
take
out
.
In
addition
to
a
plethora
of
sandwich
options
there
are
italian
dishes
as
well
.
I
've
had
the
lasagna
which
was
a
large
,
flavorful
portion
.
Desserts
are
great
too
.
Try
a
Cannoli.Deli

Great
Italian
deli

Large

Sandwich
meats

Perfect

Soooo
good
.
Go
there
.
Eat!Finally
went
to
Deli
Roma
yesterday
and
so
glad
i
did
.
I
've
been
meaning
to
go
for
a
while
but
,
always
forget
about
it
because
of
it
's
location
.
It
's
small
but
cool
at
the
same
time
.
All
the
Italian
nostalgia
in
there
is
fun
to
look
at
while
you
wait
.
We
got
a
veggie
muffaletta
,
grilled
panini
,
and
a
Chicago

It
was
the
panini
of
the
week
,
not

what
it
was
.
It
had
2
kinds
of
meat
-LRB-
ham
and
salami
i
believe
-RRB-
and
cheese
.
The

was
grilled

We
got
the

to
go
and
it
was
still
super
hot
when
we
got
home

Very
good
dog
with
all
the
fixings
.
Only
complaint
was
that
it
was
not
very
warm
but
that
's
OK
with
a
hot
dog
i
guess
.
If
you
can
find
this
place
you
need
to
go
!
The
mailman
was
eating
lunch
when
we
were
there
.
I
always
think
if
the
mailman
eats
there
,
you
know
it
's
good!Absolutely
wonderful
.
IDK
what
the
other
guy
was
talking
about
complaining
about
the
service
.
I
was
greeted
with
a
smile
and
a
friendly
conversation
while
I
waited
for
the
old
man
to
make
my
sandwiches
.
Reminds
me
of
when
I
lived
on
the
east
coast
.
Got
to
love
Boar
's
head.Boar
's
head
meats
and
cheeses
are
what
they
use
for
their
sandwiches
,
and
they
also
have
olives
,
and
some
other
deli
items
.
The
sandwiches
are
great
,
and
the
service
is
friendly
.
I
miss
their
old
employee
John
,
he
was
such
a
charming
,
handsome
young
lad
.
:--LRB-
They
even
know
Chris
Burke
!!!!
Food
was
amazing
!!!
Just
wish
it
were
open
on
Sunday
:
-RRB-
This
place
is
the
best
.
Americano
is
ridiculously
good.Place
is
pretty
good
.
Have
been
here
a
handful
of
times
.
I
always
get
the
Godfather
-LRB-
1
or
2
-RRB-
which
is
an
Italian
beef
sandwich
.
It
is
really
good
.
My
wife
really
enjoys
the
Americano
.
Overall
I
have
not
had
any
issues
,
except
for
my
recent
visit
.
There
was
an
issue
with
one
sandwich
,
called
up
and
talked
with
the
owner
.
He
was
very
understanding
and
wanted
to
make
things
right
,
so
he
gave
me
a
$
25
gift
card
to
use
the
next
time
I
'm
there
.
I
wo
n't
let
one
little
issue
stop
me
from
eating
here.This
place
is
a
great
stop
for
lunch
.
The
sandwiches
are
huge
and
they
use
boars
head
premium
deli
meat
on
their
subs
.
I
challenge
you
to
take
down
a
whole
one
.
They
also
make
fresh
pasta
and
lasagna
that
is
to
die
for
.
Check
This
Place
Out!We
went
here
on
a
Saturday
afternoon
and
no
one
was
at
the
front
counter
.
It
's
obvious
that
this
is
a
small
mom
&
pop
type
operation
,
which
is
encouraging
because
this
usually
means
good
food
.
But
we
would
n't
know
because
no
one
ever
came
to
the
counter
.
There
was
one
couple
at
a
table
eating
,
but
no
other
customers
at
the
time
.
There
was
a
dude
walking
around
in
the
back
,
he
looked
right
at
us
,
but
did
n't
acknowledge
us
in
any
way
.
We
stood
there
for
quite
a
while
and
looked
over
the
menu
repeatedly
,
hoping
that
at
any
moment
someone
might
come
forth
and
say
something
as
simple
as
``
I
'll
be
right
with
you
''
etc.
.
Did
n't
happen
.
I
get
the
whole
idea
of
them
not
being
fast
food
,
and
that
good
food
takes
time
so
on
and
so
forth
,
but
that
should
n't
also
mean
``
we
will
not
acknowledge
your
presence
.
Ever
.
''
Three
more
people
came
in
behind
us
and
proceeded
to
wait
.
There
were
then
five
of
us
crowding
around
the
counter
...
...
...
.
waiting
...
...
...
...
and
waiting
...
...
.
Here
on
Yelp
I
noticed
that
one
complaint
had
a
response
from
the
business
,
which
gives
me
some
hope
,
but
hey
guys
,
I
was
there
,
with
money
in
hand
and
you
dropped
the
ball
...
...
again
apparently
.
We
walked
out
after
waiting
a
longgggggg
time
for
nothing
.
We
may
try
again
some
day
when
we
have
absolutely
nothing
better
to
do
.
However
,
if
this
is
standard
operating
procedure
I
do
n't
know
that
they
'll
still
be
around
for
that
``
some
day
.
``
Only
place
in
the
area
that
makes
an
authentic
Vienna
beef
Chicago
style
hot
dog
.
Simply
awesome!Been
in
SP
for
a
year
now
and
only
just
discovered
this
place
on
my
way
home
tonight
.
Wanted
something
quick
,
tasty
,
and
not
from
a
fast
food
chain
.
Talk
about
a
good
stop
.
My
sandwich
was
just
filled
with
Boars
Head
ham
,
salami
,
cheese
,
delicious
fresh
tomatoes
all
on
excellent
toasted
bread
.
Considering
the
amount
of
meat
and
the
overall
size
of
this
sandwich
the
$
7
and
change
price
was
more
than
reasonable
.
I
'm
already
looking
forward
to
going
back
here
.
Service
was
pleasant
and
quick
considering
there
were
two
people
immediately
in
front
of
me
.
A
unique
gem
in
an
area
of
SP
dominated
mostly
by
fast
food
joints
.
Only
wish
they
had
better
roadside
presence
so
I
had
been
able
to
find
them
sooner!This
place
is
awesome
!
The
food
is
amazing
to
say
the
least
.
The
only
time
I
have
been
disappointed
is
when
I
showed
up
on
a
Monday
and
found
out
they
were
closed
.
Best
place
for
Italian
in
the
area
.
Thumbs
up
to
the
owner
and
staff
,
keep
it
up!Nice
little
sandwich
shop
in
Sun
Prairie
and
they
do
a
decent
job
but
they
have
big
plastic
things
of
Prosciutto
to
make
them
look
like
a
big
time
Italian
deli
only
one
problem
...
they
do
n't
serve
Prosciutto
on
any
of
their
sandwiches
and
you
ca
n't
even
order
it
extra
.
They
advertise
that
they
have
a
couple
of
types
of
Lasagna
and
to
ask
for
what
they
varieties
are
but
they
did
n't
have
any
when
i
was
there
.
The
sandwich
I
did
have
was
good
and
they
heat
up
bread
that
tastes
very
yummy
.
I
'll
give
them
another
chance.I
never
thought
I
would
write
a
one-star
review
of
Deli
Roma
,
but
I
think
this
once-great
deli
's
day
has
passed
.
For
the
last
year
or
so
the
food
has
been
slipping
and
become
mediocre
-
including
,
this
fall
,
the
worst
plate
of
spaghetti
I
've
ever
been
served
in
a
restaurant
-LRB-
by
an
employee
who
is
no
longer
there
-RRB-
,
but
our
experience
on
Saturday
pretty
much
finished
our
long
relationship
with
Deli
Roma
.
We
arrived
around
4:30
p.m.
and
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
deli
.
A
young
man
was
seated
behind
the
register
and
greeted
us
,
but
did
not
get
up
.
We
saw
the
specials
board
had
an
item
which
was
a
play
on
the
Godfather
,
their
signature
Italian
roast
beef
sandwich
,
and
discussed
whether
we
'd
want
to
try
it
.
During
all
this
the
gentleman
behind
the
counter
remained
seated
but
appeared
to
be
paying
attention
.
When
I
said
we
were
ready
to
order
he
got
up
,
but
when
I
ordered
a
Godfather
he
said
that
they
were
out
of
Italian
beef
.
I
have
worked
in
restaurants
myself
and
at
times
you
do
run
out
of
items
,
but
I
do
n't
understand
why
the
specials
board
carried
an
item
they
did
n't
have
and
more
incomprehensible
yet
is
why
he
would
listen
to
us
talk
about
the
aforementioned
special
and
never
bother
to
mention
he
could
n't
make
one
anyway
.
The
specials
board
should
have
been
blank
,
and
more
importantly
,
he
should
have
told
us
when
we
came
in
that
they
were
out
of
some
ingredients
.
If
he
had
,
we
probably
would
have
stayed
and
ordered
something
else
,
but
his
attitude
projected
total
,
casual
indifference
in
serving
us
and
getting
our
business
.
If
they
do
n't
want
our
business
,
we
wo
n't
give
it
to
them
any
more.I
found
Deli
Roma
too
late
.
Fortunately
,
I
was
able
to
enjoy
the
godfather
part
I
several
times
this
winter
before
it
closed
.
This
was
my
favorite
sandwich
,
anywhere
,
ever
,
period
.
Sad
to
see
you
go
,
thank
you
for
the
delicious
food!Ross
,
I
hope
you
're
going
to
show
up
somewhere
else
.
Sure
miss
you
in
SP.Went
here
for
a
Father
's
Day
breakfast
.
Besides
lunch
and
dinner
,
they
also
serve
breakfast
all
day
.
Nice
folks
,
darn
good
diner
food
,
nice
size
portions
.
Lots
of
old
people
come
here
,
but
they
do
n't
try
to
mug
you
in
the
bathroom
or
anything
like
that.Found
hair
in
my
food
.
BLECH
!!
Never
ever
again!Good
value
.
Owners
are
always
working
and
are
good
people
.
They
had
a
fire
recently
which
closed
the
place
down
.
Not
sure
they
've
re-opened
yet
,
but
if
not
,
hopefully
soon.I
can
not
wait
until
sir
hobos
open
up
again
.
This
place
has
the
best
breakfast
anywhere
!
The
skillet
are
to
die
for
.
This
service
is
as
good
as
any
diner
in
Chicago.Now
reopen
and
beautiful
.
Come
in
and
check
it
out.Absolutely
horrible
.
The
building
has
been
recently
remodeled
because
it
burned
.
I
'd
guess
the
insurance
company
did
n't
cover
a
replacement
broom
,
vacuum
and
cleaning
supplies
.
My
arms
stuck
to
the
new
table
,
the
floor
was
really
littered
with
garbage
and
my
silverware
was
dirty
.
Gross
.
It
was
2pm
on
Sat
and
dead
.
No
excuse
for
dirty
.
The
waitress
was
really
nice
,
I
think
her
name
was
Sarah
.
She
was
personable
and
attentive
.
She
's
the
only
reason
I
'd
give
this
place
a
star
at
all
.
I
ordered
a
Gyro
sandwich
.
It
came
with
fries
and
a
bowl
of
soup
.
I
ordered
Broccoli
Cheese
soup
.
I
think
if
I
heated
up
some
Velveeta
and
added
a
gallon
of
water
to
it
,
then
tossed
in
a
bunch
of
dirty
,
uncut
broccoli
,
I
could
duplicate
the
Sir
Hobo
recipe
.
I
wish
the
rest
of
the
meal
was
that
good
.
When
the
Gyro
arrived
,
it
reeked
of
rotten
deer
carcass
,
the
plate
was
filthy
and
the
fries
were
colder
than
Alaska
in
December
.
I
'm
not
joking
.
The
Gyro
tasted
so
bad
that
I
had
to
spit
a
mouthful
of
it
into
a
napkin
and
slug
down
a
glass
of
water
to
cleanse
the
horse-s
--
t
taste
from
my
mouth
.
Sarah
noticed
that
I
had
n't
eaten
my
food
,
she
offered
to
remove
it
from
the
bill
with
out
me
asking
.
I
would
normally
applaude
that
gesture
,
but
some
older
foreign
lady
-LRB-
I
assume
the
owner
-RRB-
came
over
and
told
her
not
to
do
that
.
``
I
'll
make
you
new
sandwich
,
''
said
the
old
lady
.
I
declined
.
I
figured
I
could
n't
choke
down
another
bite
of
the
garbage
they
call
food
.
I
paid
my
9
dollars
for
a
lousy
cup
of
liquid
Velveeta
and
left
.
I
bet
the
Dairy
Queen
across
the
parking
lot
is
glad
that
Sir
Hobo
's
is
back
open
.
I
wonder
how
many
people
have
done
what
I
did
...
walk
to
DQ
and
had
an
ice
cream
cone
to
try
to
clean
the
aftertaste
of
death
and
decay
from
my
mouth
.
Never
again
.
I
'd
go
to
DQ
instead.This
place
is
always
packed
;
however
,
the
increased
popularity
is
working
against
it
.
I
took
my
mother
,
step
father
,
and
fellow
siblings
here
for
Mother
's
day
.
It
took
fifteen
minutes
just
to
get
the
attention
of
the
waitress
.
When
the
food
finally
arrived
three
out
of
five
of
the
orders
were
completely
wrong
.
The
waitress
basically
just
negotiated
back
and
forth
with
us
until
we
agreed
to
eat
what
we
were
served
.
On
a
side
note
,
the
owner
-LRB-
older
lady
-RRB-
kept
staring
at
our
table
with
a
look
in
her
eye
that
could
have
gotten
her
a
role
in
the
movie
Scarface
.
Unfortunately
,
the
owners
no
longer
care
about
quality
like
they
did
before
the
business
burnt
down
.
It
's
just
a
numbers
thing
at
this
point
.
They
lost
a
lifer
that
day.I
recently
went
here
with
my
family
for
breakfast
and
I
look
forward
to
going
back
soon
.
The
menu
had
many
options
for
breakfast
,
even
for
Vegetarians
,
which
I
am
.
I
had
the
Veggie
Skillet
which
was
delisious
and
my
husband
enjoyed
his
inlet
as
well
.
The
portions
where
large
and
the
quality
was
high
.
A
very
clean
place
with
a
very
friendly
wait
staff
.
Good
kids
menu
too!We
used
to
live
in
Sun
Prairie
years
ago
when
we
first
moved
to
Wisconsin
.
The
first
place
we
ate
at
was
Sir
Hobos
.
At
the
time
,
the
menu
was
really
basic
and
not
much
seemed
to
be
``
homemade
''
.
To
be
honest
,
we
stopped
going
there
.
As
was
mentioned
below
,
there
was
a
fire
and
they
did
a
complete
redo
of
the
restaurant
.
The
food
seems
a
bit
better
.
I
do
agree
,
though
,
with
another
``
Yelper
's
''
judgement
on
the
cheese
soup
.
Yuk
.
It
's
so
thick
,
it
heaps
up
on
the
spoon
.
I
've
eaten
there
a
few
times
since
the
rebuild
and
it
seems
they
are
trying
to
change
.
I
hope
they
try
a
bit
harder
this
time
.
A
note
:
No
carpeting
this
time
around
.
It
's
very
noisy
.
And
the
TV
's
do
not
help.NEVER
going
back
to
this
place
.
We
went
for
breakfast
as
a
table
of
four
.
It
was
packed
,
Sunday
morning
breakfast
.
Three
of
the
four
breakfasts
went
back
.
Two
of
those
came
wrong
again
.
One
of
those
came
back
wrong
a
third
time
.
It
took
so
long
for
the
waitress
to
come
back
my
wife
had
nibbled
on
it
,
eating
around
the
block
of
Velveeta
she
specifically
asked
to
be
cheddar
.
When
we
asked
for
consideration
on
the
bill
,
we
were
told
that
she
had
eaten
it
,
so
no
discount
would
be
given
.
We
asked
to
see
the
manager
.
The
waitress
returned
and
threw
the
bill
on
the
table
saying
that
she
would
take
the
breakfast
out
of
her
tips
.
When
we
told
the
hostess
,
she
offered
a
10
%
discount
off
the
bill
.
Too
Little
Too
Late
.
There
is
no
excuse
for
a
menu
omelet
-LRB-
that
's
right
,
not
a
special
order
,
menu
-RRB-
to
come
out
wrong
three
times.We
went
back
here
for
the
second
time
since
the
remodel
.
Both
times
we
had
breakfast
items
.
We
've
never
had
lunch
or
dinner
food
here
,
and
from
reading
other
reviews
it
would
appear
that
is
a
good
thing
.
The
remodeling
looks
nice
,
and
it
's
now
a
no-smoking
establishment
.
But
neither
of
these
two
aspects
can
apparently
help
the
fact
that
your
elbows
and/or
arms
are
going
to
stick
to
the
tables
.
Maybe
it
's
a
trap
!
Like
flies
on
sticky
paper
!
Service
was
good
both
times
,
and
breakfast
food
is
solid
.
But
if
they
ca
n't
keep
the
tables
clean
,
what
else
is
filthy
dirty?I
want
to
write
nice
things
.
.
I
sooo
want
to
write
nice
things
.
.
so
here
goes
.
.
the
place
has
a
nice
warmth
to
it
.
.
family
friendly
,
which
is
always
a
plus
for
us
...
well
that
's
it
food
-
just
not
good
.
.
wife

-
the
corned
beef
tasted
.
.
let
's
go
with
questionable
.
Kids
got
hot
dogs
,
ugh
,
just
buy
a
better
brand
people
!
I
had
the
Gyro
.
.
it
was
serviceable
,
a
little
heavy
on
the
sauce
,
but
fine
.
Service
-
waitress
did
n't
give
a
d
*
mn
about
anything
.
.
so
yeah
.
.
2
stars
.
.
maybe
we
will
try
again
,
but
I
do
n't
think
soWe
went
here
for
a
family
Christmas
brunch
last
month
.
Having
lived
in
town
for
nearly
20
years
,
we
had
always
seen
but
never
actually
been
to
SIR
Hobo
's
.
We
had
no
idea
what
we
were
missing
.
When
we
first
sat
down
,
we
were
greated
by
a
jolly
waitress
with
a
thick
,
possibly
Greek
accent
.
Her
nametag
said
her
name
was
Gerestina
,
but
her
attitude
said
she
loved
her
job
.
The
complimentary
water
was
,
in
a
word
,
exquisite
.
And
the
meal
only
got
better
.
But
the
biggest
surprise
was
when
,
about
20
minutes
into
our
meal
,
a
homeless
man
with
a
whooping
cough
and
a
peg
leg
stumbled
through
the
door
and
colapsed
.
The
cook
came
crashing
out
of
the
kitchen
,
carrying
a
CPR
mask
in
one
hand
and
a
bloody
meat
cleaver
in
the
other
.
Through
his
quick
action
,
the
cook
was
able
to
resucitate
the
homeless
man
.
As
we
all
applauded
,
the
homeless
man
stood
up
to
shake
the
cook
's
hand
.
The
homeless
man
was
crying
and
gave
every
single
person
in
the
restaurant
a
great
big
bear
hug
.
It
seems
that
SIR
hobos
still
certainly
cares
for
our
fine
city
's
hobo
community.This
place
was
recommended
to
us
about
,
twenty
miles
away
?
The
loyal
following
is
out
of
the
local
area
.
So
we
had
to
check
this
place
out
.
The
building
:
The
Hobo
does
live
up
to
its
theme
;
when
you
find
it
you
will
know
it
.
The
inside
is
the
standard
dinner
area
,
also
the
preferred
seating
for
a
hobo
.
Featuring
large
areas
to
set
down
,
stretch
out
and
down
your
jacket
and
bags
.
You
can
easily
sit
for
more
than
twenty
minutes
and
not
worry
about
being
run
out
-LRB-
to
make
room
for
more
customers
-RRB-
.
The
food
:
Any
hobo
would
like
this
style
of
dining
.
Lots
of
different
things
,
so
you
will
not
get
tired
of
eating
a
lot
at
once
.
Also
the
shear
amount
will
fill
you
up
since
a
lot
of
hobos
do
not
eat
three
meals
a
day
.
Again
,
you
are
not
pressured
to
finish
fast
.
This
makes
it
much
easier
to
finish
the
large
portions
the
Hobo
has
to
offer
.
This
place
would
kill
a
Denny
's
,
without
even
trying
.
Since
I
am
not
from
the
local
area
it
is
hard
to
compare
it
to
anything
locally
.
Yea
,
I
would
eat
here
again.Ehh
...
Probably
wont
return
.
Friendly
workers
,
beautiful
restaurant
but
...
The
food
was
NOT
good
at
all
.
.
I
dont
know
where
to
really
start
.
I
guess
...
The
waitress
didnt
get
my
order
right
.
I
ordered
:
the
burger
with
BBQ
,
Bacon
,
and
onions
,
with
seasoned
fries
and
a
side
salad
with
croutons
...
The
salad
came
back
without
croutons
,
had
to
hunt
the
waitress
down
to
get
them
.
.
The
Fries
came
back
without
any
seasoning
.
and
the
fries
tasted
just
awful
!
The
Burger
wasnt
too
bad
.
.
Although
,
I
think
i
would
have
rather
have
eaten
a
Bic
Mac
lol
.
My
BF
ordered
:
The
Hobo
Skillet
with
side
of
pancakes
...
the
skillet
had
a
hair
in
it
.
.
it
was
really
greasy
and
not
much
flavor
.
.
and
whatever
flavor
it
did
have
it
wasnt
the
greatest
.
.
The
best
the
best
items
we
had
were
the
pancakes
,
and
the
croutons
.
.
I
probably
wont
go
back
again
...
:
-LRB-
It
is
what
it
is
,
a
nice
local
diner-type
place
.
It
's
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
,
but
it
beats
throwing
money
at
chain
restaurants
and
the
food
is
usually
above
par.This
place
is
just
great
!
We
have
been
here
for
breakfast
,
lunch
and
dinner
and
it
has
been
great
every
time
.
It
is
so
cheap
and
you
always
get
so
much
food
and
so
fast
to
.
They
have
a
huge
menu
which
is
awesome
!
The
workers
are
always
so
happy
and
take
good
care
of
you
!
They
just
remodeled
it
and
it
looks
so
nice
inside
and
the
bathrooms
are
always
clean
.
Great
place!Blech
.
My
brother
heard
this
was
the
best
Chinese
buffet
in
Sun
Prairie
.
Maybe
that
is
true
,
but
it
must
be
the
only
Chinese
buffet
in
Sun
Prairie
.
I
'm
not
giving
it
a
hard
time
for
``
authenticity
''
or
any
of
that
eaither
.
I
love
me
some
good
Americanized
,
crappy
Chinese
food
.
Here
,
even
the
stuff
that
was
out
fresh
from
the
kitchen
-LRB-
which
was
mighty
slim
picken
's
-RRB-
was
barely
edible
.
I
was
really
looking
forward
to
some
good
old
MIdwestern
Chinese
buffet
,
too
.
The
Chinese
food
options
in
Portland
are
actually
very
lacking
,
the
last
really
good
stuff
I
had
was
from
a
strip
mall
in
Crawfordsville
,
IN
.
Seriously
,
they
can
do
it
right
but
everyone
else
serves
lukewarm
,
tasteless
piles
of
mystery
?
Got
ta
be
kidding
me
.
Most
options
seemed
to
have
been
sitting
for
way
too
long
when
we
got
here
,
and
it
was
peak
dinner
eating
time
.
I
should
have
been
tipped
off
by
the
low
number
of
patrons
at
this
``
best
Chinese
''
but
I
like
to
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
.
You
are
better
off
making
Ramen
noodles
at
home
and
calling
it
chinese
food.This
place
is
both
a
buffet
and
a
takeout
restaurant
.
For
take
out
,
it
's
great
.
As
a
buffet
,
it
's
okay
.
The
food
is
always
fresh
and
the
buffet
is
refreshed
constantly
so
nothing
sits
out
very
long
.
It
's
nothing
fancy
,
but
it
's
good
.
Not
great
.
But
good
.
It
's
a
favorite
for
take
out
while
living
out
in
the
boonies!I
love
this
place
.
The
food
is
always
fresh
,
they
keep
an
eye
on
the
buffet
so
they
can
refill
the
trays
quickly
.
I
've
never
had
anything
here
that
was
n't
great.UPDATE
:
This
place
closed
down
about
a
year
ago
.
Sadness
.
Another
mom
and
pop
Chinese
buffet
goes
by
the
wayside
of
stretching
themselves
too
thin
.
I
resisted
going
here
for
the
past
several
years
that
I
've
lived
in
Sun
Prairie
b/c
of
all
the
other
mediocre
Chinese
food
buffet
restaurants
I
've
eaten
at
that
left
me
a
bit
disappointed
.
Their
selection
is
less
in
numbers
of
dishes
than
other
places
around
the
Dane
County
area
;
however
,
in
terms
of
quality
and
freshness
,
it
's
rather
good
.
Since
other
reviewers
did
not
go
into
significant
detail
about
the
offerings
,
I
'll
mention
my
first
time
experience
recently
on
a
Sunday
-LRB-
where
there
were
about
three
other
tables
of
diners
-RRB-
:
-
peanut
butter
chicken
-
mongolian
beef
-
chow
mein
-
a
few
sushi
rolls
-LRB-
x2
varieties
-RRB-
-
crab
rangoons
-LRB-
better
than
average
-RRB-
-
spring
rolls
-LRB-
eggrolls
,
more
aptly
-RRB-
-
popcorn
shrimp
-
two
types
of
soups
-
your
basic
hot
and
sour
or
egg
drop
-LRB-
these
were
just
OK
-RRB-
-
chicken
skewers
-LRB-
these
were
excellent
even
though
I
did
n't
expect
them
to
be
based
on
appearance
-RRB-
-
seafood
stir
fry
w
/
veggies
-
fish
fillets
-
dessert
options
looked
like
a
few
types
of
cakes
and
fruit
,
pudding
,
and
jello
.
I
like
the
emphasis
on
quality
rather
than
quantity
.
And
this
place
was
clean
.
It
's
tucked
away
in
a
strip
mall
by
Walmart
,
so
points
against
it
for
location
.
But
you
ca
n't
beat
the
price
,
$
7-8
for
a
buffet
meal
!
Of
course
,
afterwards
,
I
had
to
nap
off
the
food
coma
...
I
have
been
eating
here
for
at
least
7
years
and
it
's
excellent
.
Typically
a
group
of
us
go
there
for
lunch
coming
from
work
.
I
love
the
pepper
chicken
the
broccoli
and
the
chicken
on
a
stick
things
.
Ohh
yes
,
the
peanut
butter
chicken
is
also
excellent
.
My
4
kids
really
love
going
there
too
when
we
happen
to
be
in
that
area
on
a
weekend
.
They
've
been
going
there
every
now
and
then
since
they
were
babies
.
I
have
heard
that
they
may
not
be
able
to
renew
their
lease
as
that
part
of
the
strip
mall
may
be
changed
.
That
would
be
very
disappointing
.
They
have
been
a
loyal
staple
spot
for
years
while
stores
with
in
the
mall
have
changed
some
of
which
are
still
vacant
.
If
you
have
not
checked
them
out
give
them
a
try
.
If
you
enjoy
them
go
back
for
a
visit
incase
they
are
soon
gone.closed.This
restaurant
was
forced
to
close
due
to
a
greedy
landlord
that
suddenly
doubled
their
rent
,
probably
because
of
the
upgrades
done
with
the
new
Walmart
.
Does
anyone
know
where
this
family
went
or
if
they
opened
in
another
location
?
I
would
gladly
go
to
the
the
one
.
I
have
n't
found
any
Chinese
food
as
good.Good
old
fashioned
diner
food
with
a
generous
all
you
can
eat
prime
rib
and
butterfly
shrimp
on
Saturdays.I
have
been
here
twice
,
both
times
for
breakfast
.
Both
times
I
was
*
very
*
happy
.
I
had
the
greek
omelette
-LRB-
feta
cheese
,
spinach
,
you
know
the
deal
-RRB-
and
thought
I
had
died
and
gone
to
omelette
heaven
.
Best
I
ever
had
.
It
came
with
this
delicious
tzaziki-type
sauce
on
the
side
,
which
I
should
have
brought
home
with
me
-LRB-
I
did
finish
the
omelette
at
the
restaurant
-RRB-
.
The
second
time
I
had
this
very
interesting
strawberry
fritter
french
toast
.
I
love
french
toast
and
all
things
sugary
,
and
this
was
definitely
sweet
.
It
sort
of
had
a
filling
-LRB-
that
was
the
strawberry
part
-RRB-
.
It
was
delicious
,
but
not
for
those
who
claim
they
do
n't
like
sweets
.
The
service
is
terrific
,
very
fast
and
genuine
.
The
coffee
is
hot
and
just
right
.
You
'll
likely
be
surrounded
by
various
old
men
-LRB-
with
the
occasional
younger
man
sprinkled
in
-RRB-
,
but
these
old
guys
know
a
good
breakfast
when
they
find
one.If
you
have
not
been
here
go
.
Best
breakfast
in
Dane
county
.
I
work
out
of
state
and
every
time
I
get
to
town
this
is
my
first
stop
.
If
I
get
in
town
at
2
am
I
am
up
at
7
for
breakfast
.
Bring
and
tell
your
friends
you
wont
regret
it.How
pleasantly
surprised
I
was
to
find
this
old
school
greasy
spoon
-LRB-
and
I
say
that
as
a
compliment
-RRB-
.
This
is
the
kind
of
place
I
remember
fondly
from
my
youth
in
NJ
.
No
pretension
,
no
gimmicks
,
just
honest
food
done
well
.
I
had
one
of
the
specials
-
an
omelet
with
cilantro
,
chorizo
,
green
and
red
peppers
and
onions
.
It
was
perfect
.
Perhaps
my
favorite
part
about
my
breakfast
was
the
hash
brown
potatoes
.
At
many
places
like
this
,
they
are
soggy
and
undercooked
.
Not
only
were
they
spiced
well
,
but
they
were
crispy
as
well
.
That
's
no
joke
with
breakfast
potatoes
!
In
any
case
,
I
've
been
back
twice
in
a
week
and
a
half
,
and
plan
on
returning
often
.
Do
n't
let
the
exterior
or
decor
fool
you
;
they
make
good
food
in
that
tiny
building.I
love
local
hometown
eateries
.
So
when
we
were
looking
for
a
place
for
lunch
while
on
the
road
,
the
Prairie
Diner
called
out
to
us
.
Inside
looks
like
a
50s
diner
with
stainless
steel
lunch
counter
and
cozy
booths
.
Judging
by
the
area
around
it
,
it
can
be
that
old
but
at
least
it
looks
authentic
.
The
service
was
prompt
and
friendly
,
even
the
cook
greeted
us
when
we
walked
in
the
front
door
which
appears
to
be
the
back
door
as
you
enter
near
the
back
of
the
kitchen
and
restrooms
.
The
young
cook
even
said
thank
you
on
our
way
out
.
I
do
n't
think
I
've
ever
seen
that
before
,
I
figured
he
must
be
the
owner
.
The
wife
ordered
the
ultimate
omelette
,
I
had
the
perch
lunch
.
They
even
had
a
perch
breakfast
on
the
menu
that
comes
with
eggs
.
Only
in
Wisconsin
!
The
atmosphere
and
service
made
you
feel
right
at
home
.
The
food
was
just
average
.
We
're
not
complaining
,
other
things
are
as
important
as
the
food
in
a
restaurant
.
Much
more
memorable
than
a
stop
at
McDonald
's
next
door.This
is
just
a
tiny
restaurant
with
a
real
family
feel
.
We
came
for
a
late
breakfast
on
a
Sunday
.
The
waitstaff
were
quick
to
help
us
.
We
chose
seats
at
the
counter
.
There
were
many
specials
,
breakfast
,
lunch
,
soups
,
biscuits
and
gravy
,
lots
of
diner
food
.
We
sat
among
the
regulars
and
were
treated
like
one
of
the
family
.
The
husband
had
eggs
,
hashbrowns
and
toast-all
cooked
to
perfection
.
I
had
a
pancake
that
was
huge
and
so
delicious-just
like
dessert
for
breakfast
.
The
prices
are
reasonable
,
the
food
plentiful
and
the
atmosphere
is
very
friendly
.
Nothing
fancy
,
just
good
food.We
will
be
going
back.My
husband
and
I
stopped
in
here
on
a
freezing
Sunday
morning
.
It
's
a
small
place
,
but
does
n't
seem
too
crowded
.
We
had
eggs
benedict
,
and
it
was
VERY
good
.
Prices
they
charged
were
more
than
reasonable
for
the
quality
of
food
,
and
the
waitstaff
was
super
nice
.
As
people
who
drink
coffee
black
,
it
's
very
hard
to
find
small
places
like
this
that
you
need
no
cream
or
sugar
to
make
the
coffee
palatable
,
and
luckily
this
was
one
such
place
.
So
really
,
nice
atmosphere
,
good
food
,
nice
waitstaff
,
do
n't
even
bother
going
anywhere
else
for
breakfast.I
would
move
closer
to
this
place
if
it
was
an
option
.
I
have
enjoyed
,
more
than
I
can
say
,
everything
I
've
eaten
here
.
I
had
friends
in
town
so
ended
up
going
there
two
mornings
in
a
row
.
Saturday
I
had
the
Veggie
Benedict
-LRB-
instead
of
the
meat
layer
,
it
's
a
mix
of
tomatoes
,
mushrooms
,
onions
,
and
peppers
-RRB-
.
I
love
a
good
Eggs
Benedict
and
always
try
the
different
versions
,
but
this
is
the
best
ever
.
Sunday
I
went
back
to
my
old
friend
,
the
greek
omelette
,
and
it
was
as
good
as
ever
.
We
sat
in
a
booth
on
Saturday
and
then
at
the
counter
on
Sunday
.
The
coffee
was
hot
and
constantly
being
topped-up
.
This
is
a
Sun
Prairie
tradition
.
Local
folks
running
a
local
diner
.
The
food
is
good
with
very
down
to
earth
service.We
went
to
this
store
at
8
pm
they
close
at
10pm
they
were
out
of
dark
meat
in
crispy
,
they
had
no
mac
and
cheese
made
.
they
did
let
us
get
some
extra
chicken
because
we
wanted
three
sides
of
mac
and
cheese
.
The
people
who
woked
here
tried
very
hard
but
just
didnt
seem
to
know
what
was
going
on
.
We
went
in
for
two
10
peice
buckets
and
it
took
us
more
then
a
half
hour
to
get
what
we
needed
.
.
this
is
the
second
time
we
had
been
there
and
the
service
was
terrible
both
times.The
last
time
I
went
in
there
I
observed
:
cross
contamination
,
unfriendly
service
-LRB-
no
two
part
greeting
-RRB-
,
dirty
rag
BUCKETS
left
ON
THE
COUNTER
where
they
set
the
tongs
for
serving
food
,
no
hand
washing
by
employees
,
and
confusion
with
my
order
although
it
was
a
simple
one
consisting
of
12
strips
.
Also
,
another
customer
came
in
while
I
was
waiting
and
asked
if
they
could
prioritize
her
order
because
she
was
in
a
hurry
.
They
said
yes
,
but
it
resulted
in
a
lot
of
confusion
between
employees
which
drastically
slowed
service
time
.
The
customer
complained
about
the
wait
,
which
resulted
in
an
indifferent
response
from
a
employee
.
He
said
``
if
you
wanted
your
order
faster
you
should
have
called
it
in
''
.
He
said
this
with
an
attitude
.
Then
he
turned
to
me
and
asked
if
I
thought
he
handled
that
correctly
,
and
I
said
no
.
In
the
end
,
being
a
former
employee
of
this
establishment
,
I
was
very
disappointed
with
the
cleanliness
and
customer
service.This
location
does
not
have
good
service
.
Went
through
drive-through
and
they
forgot
our
drinks
and
our
sides
.
While
they
were
preparing
what
they
forgot
,
we
could
see
another
girl
who
had
her
back
to
us
and
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
on
her
phone
.
Any
other
KFC
would
be
better.Inexpensive
,
friendly
,
tasty
diner
.
I
was
in
town
last
week
,
and
my
friend
suggested
we
meet
up
at
the
Country
Cafe
.
I
got
the
cinnamon
roll
french
toast
with
a
side
of
sausage
links
and
coffee
.
We
spent
about
three
hours
talking
there
-LRB-
all
the
way
from
breakfast
to
lunch
!
-RRB-
but
the
servers
were
completely
gracious
about
it
.
Our
grand
total
after
downing
a
ton
of
food
was
a
little
over
$
12
for
both
of
us
.
Yay
for
specials
!
From
the
outside
,
it
is
not
the
most
scenic
of
restaurants
,
but
inside
is
what
counts!Well
how-deee
ya
'll
!!
Are
you
90
years
old
?
Do
you
live
in
or
around
Sun
Prairie
?
Well
then
you
must
hang
out
at
the
Country
Cafe
!
Everybody
from
the
old
folks
home
was
here
tonight
.
Most
of
the
time
,
I
love
old
people
,
and
here
is
why
.
They
are
old
enough
now
,
that
they
will
say
what
they
want
and
not
think
twice
,
you
know
why
?
Cuz
they
are
old
,
and
what
are
you
gon
na
do
?
Take
away
their
walkers
?
Take
the
brake
off
their
wheelchairs
?
Hell
no
you
ai
n't
!
I
am
drawn
to
slightly
inebriated
old
ladies
and
goofy
old
dudes
who
spend
the
evening
talking
at
length
about
mosquitoes
and
hip
replacements
.
Hey
look
!!
There
is
a
guy
over
in
the
corner
with
all
his
teeth
on
the
table
,
and
another
dude
with
a
dog
hidden
under
the
table
.
That
man
over
there
is
pushing
an
empty
wheelchair
around
in
circles
!
It
's
like
a
geriatric
wonderland
,
and
I
am
Alice
!
The
food
here
is
just
ok
,
but
the
prices
are
very
cheap
,
and
the
service
is
excellent
.
I
wan
na
be
awesome
when
I
'm
90
.

crossing
my
fingers

Great
place
for
great
breakfasts
and
service
.
Home
cooked
and
friendly
competent
staff.Good
inexpensive
cafe
food
.
Pleasant
waitresses
.
Things
on
menu
you
wo
n't
find
in
franchise
restaurants.My
next-door
neighbor
,
who
is
84
and
has
lived
in
Sun
Prairie
all
her
life
,
recommended
this
place
for
breakfast
.
It
has
some
very
kitschy
decor
-LRB-
basic
small-town
breakfast
restaurant
style
-RRB-
with
lots
of
gingham
and
wooden
chickens
,
but
I
did
n't
care
.
Nothing
on
the
menu
looked
very
exciting
,
and
it
seemed
like
everything
cost
a
dollar
or
two
more
than
I
would
have
expected
.
But
the
waitress
was
extremely
nice
,
the
coffee
was
good
,
and
the
food
-LRB-
I
got
the
mushroom
and
cheese
omelet
-RRB-
was
great
.
My
omelet
had
three
-LRB-
3
!
-RRB-
kinds
of
cheese
and
lots
of
nice
`
shrooms
inside
.
It
was
terrific
and
also
came
with
hash
browns
and
my
choice
of
toast/pancakes/muffin
.
I
got
the
rye
toast
,
as
always
.
We
got
there
around
8:30
am
-LRB-
on
a
weekday
-RRB-
and
almost
had
the
place
to
ourselves
but
more
people
kept
trickling
in
as
we
ate.I
live
in
Colorado
and
was
returning
home
to
Wisconsin
for
a
wedding
.
So
happy
to
find
this
amazing
little
diner
off
of
Highway
151
.
A
hardy
old-fashioned
breakfast
with
real
food
and
friendly
serviceGreat
experience
.
Great
ice
cream
.
Always
a
good
alternative
to
the
restaurant
across
the
parking
lot
.
DQ
rocks
...
I
can
not
recommend
DQ
's
food
.
It
is
edible
but
not
great
.
But
who
on
earth
goes
here
for
anything
but
ice
cream
?
They
have
a
pretty
good
selection
of
grab-and-go
stuff
in
the
freezer
by
the
door
,
and
there
is
a
drive-through
.
The
inside
is
very
small
,
and
they
close
up
for
a
month
-LRB-
I
want
to
say
January
-RRB-
,
I
'm
guessing
for
the
owners
to
snowbird
it
.
Every
ice
cream
item
I
've
ever
gotten
from
here
has
been
great
.
I
had
a
pumpkin
Blizzard
in
the
fall
that
was
DELISH
.
If
you
are
the
first
car
through
the
drive-through
you
should
count
your
lucky
stars
.
If
you
are
n't
the
first
then
you
might
have
quite
a
wait
-LRB-
understandable
,
since
the
car
in
front
of
you
might
be
ordering
Peanut
Buster
Parfaits
for
the
entire
marching
band
and
you
'd
never
know
until
it
was
too
late
-RRB-
.
A
couple
of
times
I
've
dealt
with
employees
who
seemed
to
hate
me
and
whatever
I
was
ordering
-LRB-
the
median
age
of
these
people
seems
to
be
about
19
-RRB-
,
but
the
ice
cream
was
still
great
.
Other
times
I
've
had
extremely
friendly
and
happy-seeming
people
at
the
window/register
.
Again
,
yummy
ice
cream.This
DQ
location
has
an
update
:
they
are
now
paired
with
Orange
Julius
and
so
had
to
get
rid
of
the
fryers
.
I
'm
fine
with
that
;
I
'm
just
there
for
the
sugary
treats
anyhow
.
I
try
not
to
visit
this
place
too
often
,
as
it
is
completely
unredeemable
nutritionally
.
But
so
yummy
!
Anyway
,
I
was
intrigued
by
the
Blizzard
flavor
of
the
month
-LRB-
or
,
as
the
sign
says
,
the
BLIZZ
FLAV
-RRB-
:
Lemon
Meringue
.
So
I
buckled
the
kids
in
the
minivan
and
headed
out
.
It
's
summer
vacation
,
so
I
do
n't
feel
bad
about
having
them
out
after
9pm
.
It
seems
like
most
of
Sun
Prairie
felt
the
same
way
,
because
when
we
got
there
we
were
the
sixth
car
or
so
in
line
for
the
drive-through
.
Instead
of
waiting
forever
in
line
with
the
engine
running
I
parked
in
the
miniscule
lot
and
walked
in
.
I
was
then
second
in
line
behind
some
squirrely
teenage
girls
.
There
were
three
young
people
working
,
and
they
were
seriously
running
their
arses
off
.
The
young
woman
who
helped
the
teen
in
front
of
me
and
then
me
was
nothing
but
professional
and
courteous
.
My
Blizzards
were
perfection
-LRB-
Lemon
Meringue
and
Mint
Oreo
-RRB-
.
I
docked
a
star
just
because
the
place
is
so
squished.I
'm
embarrassed
to
be
writing
this
review
.
Why
,
you
ask
?
Well
it
means
coping
to
a
number
of
things
:
1
.
I
was
at
Dairy
Queen
.
I
'll
stop
there
.
Naw
,
I
'll
keep
going
...
2
.
Even
though
I
'm
lactose
intolerant
,
there
's
just
something
about
a
blizzard
I
ca
n't
say
no
to
.
3
.
Yes
,
even
Yelp
's
lover
of
local
winds
up
at
a
chain
every
now
and
again
.
It
's
usually
during
a
dark
period
or
when
I
'm
leaving
a
meeting
in
Sun
Prairie
and
I
drive
by
the
only
DQ
I
know
of
in
Wisconsin
.
4
.
The
basis
for
my
low
rating
is
a
terrible
blizzard
that
crushed
all
my
blizzard
dreams
.
5
.
The
real
basis
for
my
low
rating
is
the
fact
that
they
took
out
friers
,
so
gone
are
the
days
of
crisp
``
chicken
''
fingers
and
white
bread
...
seriously
why
were
the
baskets
served
with
white
bread
?
At
the
end
of
the
day
,
the
product
,
and
I
mean
water
,
maaaaaybe
skim
milk
and
flavoring
just
did
n't
meet
my
expectations
as
blizzards
have
before
.
-LRB-
I
told
you
,
I
'm
embarrassed
-RRB-
Add
to
this
the
fact
that
when
it
comes
to
``
Brazier
''
all
you
can
get
is
a
hot
dog
swimming
in
funky
hot
dog
water
and
there
's
little
to
no
reason
for
me
to
stop
here
anymore
.
I
want
to
take
this
opportunity
to
apologize
to
Michael
's
,
Culver
's
and
most
of
all
Kopps
in
Milwaukee
.
I
'll
never
stray
again
.
You
should
n't
either.All
excited
about
the
tostadas
.
When
I
received
them
they
were
ice
cold
.
The
only
reason
for
the
three
stars
was
the
service
was
super
friendly.Good
bar
and
the
food
is
ok
not
remarkable
but
good
.
Portions
sort
of
skimpy
but
they
ar
ealways
expanding
the
menu
.
They
do
have
a
pretty
good
Rib
eye
however
but
nothing
else
was
that
memorable
.
I
will
eat
there
again
I
'm
sure.Great
food
,
new
management
,
greatly
improved
.
The
wings
are
very
good
.
The
fish
fry
is
top
notch
,
the
Walleye
is
very
good
too.Stuck
in
Lodi
for
the
day
,
I
could
n't
find
a
place
for
lunch
,
and
I
dared
not
to
try
``
The
Pizza
Pit
''
in
town
.
I
thought
I
'd
head
east
and
come
here
for
lunch
since
I
did
n't
find
anything
better
.
Years
ago
,
this
used
to
be
a
place
called
Stockade
and
I
loved
it
.
Now
it
's
a
Badgers/Packers
bar
and
grill
.
Visible
from
I-90
,
just
west
of
Madison
,
there
's
a
cheese
place
-LRB-
Mouse
Haus
I
believe
-RRB-
and
warehouses
for
Pepsi
and
Walgreen
's
nearby
.
The
Rodeside
Grill
resembles
a
log
cabin
style
fort
from
the
outside
.
Years
ago
,
this
place
used
to
be
called
Stockade
.
Once
inside
,
it
's
quite
spacious
with
high
ceilings
and
an
all
wood
interior
,
except
for
the
tile
on
the
floor
.
The
whole
place
looks
very
clean
,
not
grungy
and
aged
like
so
many
bars
in
Wisconsin
.
I
sat
down
to
eat
at
the
bar
.
All
along
the
bar
counter
,
there
were
blurbs
and
excerpts
of
Packers
and
Badgers
accomplishments
underneath
the
laminated
countertop
.
The
place
even
had
green-colored
ductwork
,
so
I
knew
I
was
deep
in
Packers
territory
.
A
big
screen
TV
aired
game
highlights
from
the
Packers-Saints
NFL
season
opener
from
the
day
before
.
Large
men
with
mustaches
came
in
for
lunch
,
typical
Wisconsin
body
types
.
I
kept
a
low
profile
and
my
Chicago
origin
and
calmly
requested
the
Friday
fish
fry
special
.
Having
traveled
up
north
on
many
occasions
,
this
was
n't
the
first
time
I
was
surrounded
by
Packer
fans
.
It
's
not
hard
to
deal
with
them
if
you
do
n't
disclose
where
you
're
from
and
stick
to
the
menu
items
or
make
a
positive
comment
about
Jordy
Nelson
being
an
awesome
rising
star
on
the
team
.
The
fish
arrived
in
a
few
minutes
and
it
came
with
a
side
of
fries
that
were
seasoned
and
coated
-
quite
tasty
in
fact
.
Coleslaw
is
also
a
ca
n't
-
miss
item
north
of
Illinois
and
this
place
has
it
right
too
.
I
found
the
meal
quite
enjoyable
.
The
bartender
got
me
another
iced
tea
and
then
spent
a
few
more
minutes
of
admiring
the
place
.
The
Packers
highlights
gave
way
to
NASCAR
on
the
TV
,
but
I
was
on
my
way
,
150
miles
from
Chicago
once
again
.
While
I
went
for
the
fish
,
Rodeside
also
has
some
good
burgers
,
from
what
I
saw
around
me
at
lunch
that
day
.
Worth
a
stop
on
your
way
to
the
Dells
or
Lodi
for
that
matter
.
Just
leave
the
Bears
stuff
in
the
car.We
broke
down
on
the
road
and
and
eat
here
we
had
a
very
good
meal
.
We
would
stop
here
again.Met
a
client
there
for
lunch
and
I
thought
the
food
was
good
.
It
is
located
right
off
the
highway
so
it
is
easy
to
get
to
.
There
is
a
private
lot
which
makes
parking
easy
and
they
did
have
lots
of
options
on
the
menu
.
I
had
the
philly
beef
sandwich
that
was
pretty
good
.
The
other
plus
is
they
have
lots
of
daily
specials
every
day
.
Not
sure
when
I
would
be
back
but
I
would
not
hesitate
to
bring
a
client
there
or
eat
lunch
there
if
I
found
myself
in
the
area.Went
to
check
out
the
Rodeside
Grill
for
breakfast
last
Saturday
with
a
group
.
Most
of
us
have
n't
been
there
before
but
we
heard
good
things
from
friends
and
saw
the
Breakfast
menu
online
and
thought
we
should
try
it
out
.
Got
a
super
warm
greeting
at
the
door
and
seated
immediately
.
Had
a
nice
dining
area
separate
from
the
bar
area
and
was
clean
an
spacious
.
Our
group
was
rather
chatty
so
it
took
us
a
while
to
order
but
the
waitress
was
very
nice
and
patient
.
I
got
the
Southwestern
Omelet
with
pancakes
-
a
little
spicy
but
good
.
Others
in
our
group
got
the
french
toast
and
one
got
prime
rib
and
eggs
.
All
were
happy
.
Yummy
food
and
good
portions
.
Cost
was
decent
-
and
we
all
got
$
off
for
checking
in
on
Facebook
!
We
were
very
pleased
and
are
planning
on
coming
back
again
to
try
dinner.Food
is
average
,
but
for
the
prices
they
charge
,
it
should
be
better
.
Nice
atmosphere.My
wife
and
I
discovered
Roadside
while
house
hunting
in
the
area
...
simply
put
...
good
food
,
atmosphere
and
friendly
and
efficient
service
!!!
Highly
Recommended
!!
Bar
is
okay
and
the
atmosphere
is
nice
.
Food
is
below
average
and
pricey
.
Our
food
was
cold
and
when
we
commented
on
that
the
sever
did
n't
seem
to
care.Great
restaurant
!
A
group
of
seven
of
us
ate
at
this
restaurant
last
Saturday
.
The
location
is
very
convenient
.
The
ambiance
is
very
casual
,
yet
nice
.
The
menu
has
a
nice
variety
-LRB-
sandwiches/burgers/pasta
/
fish
-RRB-
.
I
had
a
the
bowtie
pasta
,
which
the
menu
said
was
spicy
and
it
was
.
Not
too
incredibly
hot
you
could
n't
eat
it
,
but
it
diffenetly
had
a
nice
bite
.
It
came
with
a
soup
or
salad
and
was
more
than
enough
food
.
Others
in
our
party
had
a
fish
sandwich
,
tortilla
encrusted
tilapia
,
burito
,
pork
roast
and
a
couple
of
salads
.
All
were
very
satisfied
with
their
dinners
.
I
disagree
with
other
users
that
the
prices
are
high
.
I
found
them
to
be
extremely
reasonable
for
the
quantity
and
quality
of
food
you
are
given
.
Beers/wine
also
seems
to
be
reasonable
.
I
had
a
glass
of
pinot
grigio
and
it
was
only
$
4.95
.
I
was
extremely
impressed
with
the
service
.
The
restaurant
was
busy
and
our
waitress
told
us
a
large
order
had
just
came
in
and
she
apologized
for
the
wait
.
Despite
all
of
the
people
in
the
restaurant
,
our
wait
was
not
excessive
.
I
wish
I
lived
closer
.
This
is
worth
going
to
again!Great
service
here
and
really
good
food
.
The
dairy
is
from
a
local
farm
.
I
had
the
Sassy
Cow
cheese
curds
made
with
cheese
from
a
local
farm
and
the
smokehouse
burger
.
Make
sure
you
try
their
ranch
,
it
's
also
made
in
house
.
Our
server
,
Roxy
,
was
world
class
.
Docking
1
star
because
the
fries
were
n't
too
tasty
.
The
ranch
definitely
saved
them.Don
'
t
go
in
the
Drive
Thru
if
there
are
more
than
3
cars
.
You
will
sit
there
for
20
minutes.Lifetime
favorite
.
Restaurant
was
recently
renovated
,
added
more
seating
,
and
updated
decor.Love
me
some
A&W
.
Best
fast
food
out
there
and
there
needs
to
be
more
of
them!This
location
always
prepares
everything
well
,
fresh
,
fast
,
and
they
are
friendly
.
I
visit
here
from
work
in
Sun
Prairie
,
maybe
once
every
couple
of
weeks
.
My
normal
selection
is
the
Coney
Dog
Combo
but
with
cheese
curds
.
Kind
of
on
the
expensive
side
-LRB-
give
the
cheese
curds
substitution
-RRB-
,
at
$
8.00
and
some
change
,
but
a
nice
alternative
from
the
same
old
crap
.
The
cheese
curds
are
awesome
.
They
are
soft
and
have
a
light
coating
of
breading
-LRB-
probably
just
flour
-RRB-
,
compared
to
Culver
's
,
which
is
more
breading
than
crust
,
and
normally
not
even
melted
.
I
'd
recommend
going
here
if
in
the
area
and
in
the
mood
for
some
better
fast
food.I
enjoy
this
place
everytime
I
go
in
there
.
Its
family
owned
and
has
consistently
good
food
.
Large
soda
selection
with
awesome
crab
rangoon
.
My
favorite
dish
is
the
Happy
family
which
has
beef
,
pork
,
chicken
,
crab
,
and
veggies
in
brown
sauce.Way
too
sweet
for
my
liking
.
Real
authentic
Chinese
food
is
n't
always
sweet
.
In
my
opinion
,
if
you
like
sweet
taste
this
much
,
might
as
well
eat
candy
bar
dip
in
corn
syrup
as
a
meal
.
When
I
ordered
my
food
a
few
years
back
from
them
,
they
put
too
much
food
coloring
so
much
that
it
looked
yellow
.
It
was
not
appealing
to
me
.
But
it
has
been
years
I
have
n't
been
there
so
they
could
have
improved
and
better
.
I
sure
hope
that
's
the
case.As
far
as
take-out
places
go
in
Madison
,
this
is
my
favorite
.
Consistently
tasty
,
fair
prices
,
large
portions
,
and
friendly
employees
.
I
am
eating
microwaved
general
tso
's
chicken
from
last
night
and
it
is
still
awesome
.
Excellent
steamed
dumplings
and
egg
rolls.The
fried
dumplings
rock!One
liner
for
quick
reads
:
Fresh
made
Hot
and
Sour
soup
!
Yes
...
they
make
the
Hot
and
Sour
Soup
when
you
order
it
...
no
gelatinous
,
nasty
leftovers
here
.
Service
can
be
a
little
slow
,
but
definitely
worth
it
.
Good
overall
food
.
Our
favorite
Chinese
takeout
.
-LRB-
note
...
we
always
pick
up
,
so
I
can
not
comment
on
the
delivery
-RRB-
It
was
delicious
,
but
expensive
for
delivery
.
I
had
the
cashew
chicken
-LRB-
no
veggies
,
so
they
gave
me
extra
meat
-
thumbs
up
!
-RRB-
,
crab
rangoon
and
a
2-L
of
soda
.
Very
friendly
staff.We
go
here
religiously
whenever
we
are
craving
Chinese
take-out
-LRB-
which
happens
a
lot
!
-RRB-
I
could
imagine
this
place
is
overlooked
but
it
seriously
has
some
of
the
best
food
in
town
.
Service
is
fast
and
the
food
comes
out
consistently
great
every
time
.
Order
the
pork
fried
rice
,
you
wo
n't
regret
it.Singapore
dish
was
perfect
!!
And
they
even
had
my
favorite
nestea
pomegranate
&
passion
fruit
.
.
Huge
portions
also!Good
stuff
!
Had
the
sesame
chicken
,
general
tsa
,
pot
stickers
,
and
crab
Rangoon
.
All
were
great
,
and
were
ready
quickly.Pretty
good
for
takeout
.
The
meat
is
more
sound
than
usual
Chinese
take
outMy
daughter
and
I
stopped
in
last
night
for
the
first
time
.
I
had
the
Chicken
Chop
Suey
and
she
had
Sweet
&
Sour
Chicken
.
We
started
with
an
order
of
Steamed
Dumplings
.
The
dumplings
were
great
.
They
had
a
lot
of
meat
in
them
.
The
Chop
Suey
was
made
with
a
white
sauce
.
I
am
used
to
it
being
made
with
a
brown
sauce
.
That
did
not
matter
as
it
was
delicious
.
The
S&S
Chicken
was
wonderful
as
well
.
The
S&S
sauce
that
came
with
it
was
not
laden
with
all
that
bright
red
food
coloring
.
Very
tasty
.
She
also
got
an
Egg
Roll
.
It
was
huge
!
We
had
to
split
it
.
Niiice
.
And
,
even
though
you
order
and
pick
your
food
up
at
a
counter
,
the
service
was
great
.
I
ordered
a
Chicken
Lo
Main
to
go
for
my
son
and
she
asked
me
if
I
wanted
them
to
wait
a
bit
before
they
cooked
it
.
I
like
that
!
That
tells
me
that
they
care
about
our
experience
after
I
pay
them
!!
A
plus
!
We
've
passed
this
place
up
numerous
times
.
Not
any
more
.
We
'll
be
back!Still
good
but
I
tried
the
Chicken
Fried
Rice
.
Do
n't
bother
.
The
chicken
was
tasteless
.
All
they
did
was
steam
it
.
The
seasoning
was
all
in
the
rice
.
Disappointing
.
I
thought
fried
rice
was
an
industry
standard.My
husband
and
I
came
in
Saturday
night
to
dine
in
.
-LRB-
Ca
n't
say
that
's
a
very
popular
option
,
but
I
was
starving
-RRB-
While
we
were
waiting
,
we
were
given
complimentary
crab
rangoon
.
So
nice
.
The
restaurant
is
owned
by
a
couple
who
are
incredibly
kind
.
It
made
me
all
warm
and
fuzzy
being
customers
at
such
a
lovely
family
establishment
.
The
crab
rangoon
was
piping
hot
and
filled
with
cheesy
,
crab
goodness
.
The
hot
and
sour
soup
was
incredibly
substantial
with
tons
of
veggies
and
delicious
broth
.
It
was
extra
thick
and
perfect
on
a
cold
and
windy
day
.
My
entree
was
shrimp
and
chicken
lo
mein
which
I
totes
recommend
.
The
shrimp
was
not
overcooked
and
the
noodes
were
packed
again
with
tons
of
veggies
.
People
are
nice
.
Prices
are
good
.
Food
is
huge
,
and
tasty
.
If
I
did
n't
live
on
the
West
side
,
I
'd
be
here
every
week.Best
Chinese
take-out
in
town
.
They
have
the
best
pork
egg
rolls
I
've
ever
had
.
The
woman
who
answers
the
phone
and
works
the
counter
does
n't
speak
English
very
well
and
yells
a
lot
but
I
'm
willing
to
put
up
with
that
considering
their
food
is
so
good.Pretty
decent
.
But
I
think
all
Chinese
in
Madison
is
pretty
decent
.
Nothing
has
truly
blown
me
away
,
this
place
included
.
While
staff
is
nice
and
carryout
is
quick
,
food
I
ordered
-LRB-
veggie
fried
rice
and
Mongolian
chicken
-RRB-
just
did
n't
have
much
flavor
.
Like
at
all
.
The
menu
is
extensive
,
though
,
and
maybe
I
need
to
head
back
there
to
try
more
of
it
?
They
make
a
big
claim
that
if
you
do
n't
see
it
on
their
menu
they
'll
find
a
way
to
make
it
,
however
that
did
n't
hold
true
when
I
asked
about
Cantonese
pan
fried
noodles
...
an
item
that
seems
near
impossible
to
find
in
this
town.Although
the
staff
was
friendly
and
the
language
was
not
a
barrier
for
me
as
it
was
for
others
,
the
food
I
got
was
not
very
good
.
After
I
ordered
the
General
Tso
's
Chicken
,
the
woman
turned
on
the
fryer
and
,
without
waiting
for
the
oil
to
heat
up
,
she
put
in
the
chicken
and
my
crab
rangoon
.
Therefore
,
when
I
ate
the
food
it
was
n't
crispy
as
a
good
General
Tso
's
/
crab
rangoon
should
be
.
Another
thing
that
I
noticed
was
that
the
chicken
that
she
put
in
the
fryer
was
sitting
on
the
counter
in
the
heat
.
*
note
:
she
had
n't
fried
any
in
quite
some
time
which
is
why
she
had
to
turn
the
fryer
on
.
The
person
that
said
the
food
was
too
sweet
was
right
.
Even
though
the
menu
said
*
spicy
for
my
meal
,
there
was
no
``
zip
''
at
all
.
Take
it
for
what
it
's
worth
,
but
I
know
I
will
be
looking
for
another
restaurant
to
get
my
take
out
from
now
on.This
place
is
great
.
If
you
live
on
the
east
side
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
the
happy
family
,
lo
mein
,
and
fried
pork
wontons
-LRB-
wontons
are
a
must
!!
-RRB-
I
was
a
little
thrown
off
when
I
first
moved
to
the
east
side
of
Madison
and
drove
past
this
place
.
It
does
n't
have
much
curb
appeal
but
I
decided
to
go
in
to
check
it
out
anyways
,
the
pictures
inside
were
nice
and
the
people
are
friendly
and
the
lady
even
gave
me
free
wontons
since
it
was
my
first
time
,
so
it
was
a
win
win
win
!
Call
ahead
as
they
state
on
their
website
that
they
appreciate
it
if
you
do.Best
take
out
Chinese
in
East
Madison
.
Food
is
always
fresh
and
well
cooked
.
Sometimes
you
have
to
make
sure
they
did
n't
forget
the
rice
-
mainly
when
the
woman
who
typically
works
the
front
counter
is
not
there
.
I
have
always
found
the
service
to
be
friendly
.
Periodically
,
I
have
even
received
free
chicken
dumplings
or
a
soda
.
By
far
the
best
Moo
Shu
I
have
found
in
Madison
after
living
here
for
15
years
and
trying
several
of
the
more
upscale
places
in
town
.
FYI
,
there
is
a
small
seating
area
here
but
it
is
mainly
a
takeout
place.Best
Chinese
in
town
.
Yeah
,
I
know
,
Madison
is
short
on
good
Chinese
.
However
,
this
place
has
good
prices
,
decent
food
and
great
service
.

Great
customer
service
.
I
put
that
first
because
it
is
difficult
to
find
at
carry
out
places
.

I
had
the
steamed
dumplings
as
my
appetizer
.
Delicious
!
HOT
-LRB-
temperature
-RRB-
!
and
very
satisfying
.
They
are
large
in
size
and
8
in
an

For
our
entree
we
ordered
Chicken
Lo
Mein
and
Combo
of
General
Tsao
's
chicken
which
came
with
a
pork
eggroll
.
Everything
was
delicious
and
fresh
.
The
Lo
Mein
was
hot
and
the
noodles
were
perfectly
cooked
.
Nothing
was
over
done
.
The
General
's
chicken
came
with
pork
fried
rice
.
You
could
tell
everything
was
fresh
.
It
had
great
flavor
.
The
Flaming
Wok
was
not
anything
new
,
but
it
was
good
quality
.
The
food
was
hot
and
delicious
.
It
was
a
fair
price
and
the
counter
guy
threw
in
some
extra
goodies
.
Not
to
mention
,
after
a
long
Target
trip
,
you
can
call
and
your
food
will
be
ready
in
15
minutes.Used
to
be
a
fabulously
affordable
restaurant
with
good
food
,
too
-LRB-
and
a
nice
vegetarian
plate
selection
-RRB-
.
Then
in
they
suddenly
printed
new
,
fancy
menus
-LRB-
minus
the
vegetarian
listing
-RRB-
,
jacked
up
the
prices
,
and
decorated
the
place
up
a
little
more
.
After
that
the
food
did
n't
taste
as
good
and
the
service
became
lackluster
-
perhaps
forgiveable
if
not
for
the
price
increases
.
Our
little
group
of
Laredo
's
fans
was
heartbroken.Never
been
upset
with
Loredo
's
.
Resturant
is
always
clean
and
service
is
always
good
.
I
prefer
their
new
location
in
Fitchburg.I
did
n't
think
the
meal
was
spectacular
but
it
was
fast
.
I
love
the
salsa
and
chips
they
put
out
and
the
at
atmosphere
is
casual/enjoyable
.
I
think
in
the
evening
,
it
sounds
like
a
fun
place
but
we
came
for
lunch.Pretty
good
.
Nice
chips
,
good
burrito
.
Have
n't
found
any
Wonderful
mexican
in
Madison
so
far
,
but
this
is
not
bad.Very
good
mexican
food
.
Authentic
in
taste
and
atmosphere
.
The
Fajita
Guadalajara
is
our
favorite
.
We
share
it
and
there
's
plenty
for
both
of
us.I
've
been
to
Laredo
's
three
times
now
,
and
it
just
does
n't
do
it
for
me
.
The
food
is
fine
,
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
.
+
pretty
cheap
+
lots
of
combo
platters
so
you
can
easily
mix
it
up
-
chips/salsa
not
that
good
-
food
is
only
average
Tonight
I
ordered
the
chimichangas
.
Instead
of
one
big
one
,
you
get
two
smaller
ones
.
Since
you
get
two
and
your
choice
of
chicken
or
beef
,
I
asked
for
one
of
each
.
They
brought
my
platter
,
and
after
I
took
a
bite
of
beans
I
noticed
our
waitress
hovering
over
me
with
another
platter
.
She
explained
that
``
this
one
''
had
one
of
each
,
and
that
she
was
going
to
take
the
one
they
gave
me
and
``
just
throw
it
away
.
''
A
waste
,
because
it
was
n't
really
that
big
of
a
deal
if
they
'd
brought
me
two
of
the
same
;
there
was
no
price
difference
and
I
was
n't
dead
set
on
having
one
of
each
.
As
it
turns
out
,
I
think
they
had
originally
given
me
what
I
asked
for
and
took
it
away
,
because
my
replacement
plate
was
two
chicken
chimis
*
.
Food
trashed
for
no
reason
,
and
potentially
the
correct
order
-LRB-
or
they
plated
it
incorrectly
,
twice
-RRB-
.
*
Their
idea
of
chimichangas
are
really
just
bigger-than-average
flautas
;
they
were
open-ended
and
have
no
filling
aside
from
the
meat
.
They
also
offer
flautas
,
I
wonder
if
they
're
just
the
same
thing
.
Other
blips
in
service
:
-
served
everyone
but
one
person
at
the
table
,
and
took
forever
to
finally
bring
them
their
food
-LRB-
soup
-RRB-
-
we
had
three
kids
with
our
group
,
and
their
parents
explained
they
were
going
to
split
a
meal
between
the
three
of
them
;
the
waitress
did
n't
bring
any
extra
plates
,
so
we
made
``
plates
''
out
of
napkins
So
,
yeah
.
The
food
there
is
fine
,
but
the
atmosphere
-LRB-
dark
-RRB-
and
service
-LRB-
lacking
-RRB-
make
it
pretty
low
on
my
list
of
Mexican
places
in
Madison.There
really
are
n't
many
places
to
eat
in
Madison
as
other
reviews
have
stated
.
Being
from
NY
it
really
did
seem
like
a
no
mans
land
,
so
thankfully
Yelp
came
to
our
rescue
.
We
went
to
Laredo
's
and
got
carne
asada
,
nachos
with
chicken
,
chimichanga
's
,
and
churros
.
It
was
n't
the
greatest
but
it
was
n't
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
.
We
only
got
our
food
to
take-out
so
I
do
n't
really
know
about
there
wait
staff
or
the
bar
.
We
got
our
food
pretty
quickly
and
it
was
hot
but
not
really
well
packaged
.
When
we
got
back
to
the
hotel
some
of
packages
where
leaking
,
it
was
annoying
but
did
n't
effect
the
taste
.
All
the
food
was
good
and
has
something
familiar
about
it
.
If
your
in
Madison
,
WI
and
are
looking
for
decent
Mexican
then
try
Laredo
's
.
I
think
Laredo
's
has
the
best
Mexican
food
in
Madison
.
I
really
like
their
salsa
and
guacamole
.
They
have
great
cheese
enchiladas
too
.
Their
margaritas
are
really
tasty
too
:--RRB-
I
recommend
going
to
eat
here.I
have
to
admit
that
I
was
a
little
bit
surprised
in
that
the
food
was
actually
pretty
good
.
I
'm
not
sure
why
I
was
expecting
otherwise
.
I
guess
because
from
the
outside
it
just
looks
like
your
standard
cookie
cutter
Mexican
restaurant
.
Hell
maybe
it
is
.
I
had
a
veggie
fajita
that
came
out
,
as
it
should
,
sizzling
on
a
cast
iron
skillet
.
The
veggies
were
well
prepared
and
flavorful
,
as
were
the
beans
and
rice
that
came
with
them
.
The
only
complaint
I
have
is
with
the
horchata
I
drank
.
It
tasted
OK
,
but
it
was
too
rich
.
Like
they
ran
low
on
rice
milk
and
supplemented
with
cow
milk
or
something
.
It
also
left
a
slight
film
in
my
mouth
which
is
a
quick
way
to
get
me
to
dislike
anything.It
's
not
the
best
or
most
authentic
,
but
I
love
it
.
The
service
is
great
and
combo
#
1
is
a
home
run.This
is
about
the
one
near
Hilldale
.
Awful
.
No
stars
.
I
guess
we
should
have
taken
our
clues
form
the
emptiness
of
the
restaurant
and
the
fact
happy
our
lasted
until
closing
...
The
margarita
was
a
sickly
peach
color
and
was
solid
in
the
pitcher
.
The
plates
were
served
with
the
thumb
of
a
dirty
oven
mitt
in
the
food
-LRB-
I
'm
guessing
they
came
out
of
the
microwave
-RRB-
.
The
enchiladas
were
slimy
and
water-logged
covered
in
a
dilute
,
flavorless
``
mole
''
-LRB-
i
would
n't
call
it
that
.
The
rice
was
instant
and
without
any
seasoning
,
not
even
salt
,
with
a
couple
bits
of
also
favor
less
corn
.
The
waiter
did
one
of
those
disinterested
``
howseverythinggoingeverythingokay
''
before
we
flagged
him
back
to
say
it
was
inedible
.
We
declined
his
offer
to
make
it
again
and
just
received
a
bill
for
the
margaritas
that
we
also
left
.
On
the
way
,
when
we
commented
on
how
gross
the
food
looked
as
well
as
tasted
,
another
dinner
confirmed
she
would
never
go
there
again
.
So
we
went
across
the
road
to
Pascals
and
had
real
margaritas
and
excellent
enchiladas
with
Mole
.
Stay
away!Ole
?
Oh
no
.
I
can
safely
say
I
tried
it
,
right
?
They
have
an
extensive
menu
,
reasonably
priced
lunch
specials
,
and
decent
salsa
,
but
that
's
about
it
.
Guacamole
that
came
with
my
chicken
fajitas
looked
like
someone
had
driven
over
it
with
a
Mack
truck
and
it
did
n't
taste
much
better
.
Chicken
was
grisly
and
lacked
flavor
and
the
peppers
were
so
over
cooked
they
melted
in
my
mouth
.
Not
in
that
good
melt-in-your-mouth
sort
of
way
.
In
my
quest
to
find
the
best
of
the
Mex
in
the
Midwest
,
Laredo
's
did
n't
have
it
.
Got
a
rec
?
Let
me
know.Basic
Mexican
fare
.
Service
is
good
.
Food
is
inexpensive
.
I
am
a
regular
.
See
more
info
in
my
review
of
Pedro
's
.
Food
was
excellent
and
our
server
was
exceptional
.
He
was
friendly
,
checked
back
with
us
often
,
and
made
sure
we
had
a
great
meal
.
I
would
go
back
for
the
food
,
but
the
server
we
had
put
it
over
the
top
for
me.Some
of
the
best
Mexican
food
in
Madison
.
Well
priced
,
great
food
,
friendly
service
,
and
nice
atmosphere.This
is
where
you
go
to
get
wrecked

by
cheese
.
If
you
like
cheese
A
LOT
,
you
can
order
any
of
their
delicious
combos
smothered
in
ooey
,
gooey
,
creamy
,
warm
cheese
.
Is
there
actually
any
real
food
underneath
the
gigantic
blobs
of
cheese
?
Strap
on
a
portable
oxygen
tank
and
dive
in
to
find
out
!
In

1988

revenge

blurp

blurp

so
,
chinese
food
...
i
never
care
for
it
,
but
every
once
in
a
while
,
mr.
bekee
gets
a
hankerin
'
,
so
i
go
along
.
their
vegetable
moo
shu
was
excellent
.
a
great
mix
of
fresh
,
crispy
-LRB-
when
necessary
-RRB-
vegetables
and
egg
,
delivered
with
four
pancakes
-LRB-
not
flour
tortillas
,
like
some
places
try
to
pull
-RRB-
,
and
yummy
plum
sauce
.
the
vegetable
spring
roll
was
also
a
success
,
though
a
little
over-greasy
.
my
dining
companion
had
a
three-meat
and
garlic
sauce
dish
,
which
he
said
was
delicious
with
dumplings
and
a
pork
egg
roll
.
all
were
very
tasty
.
the
best
part
was
that
the
delivery
took
under
15
minutes
!
and
we
're
over
2
miles
away
,
as
the
car
drives
.
i
presume
they
'll
become
part
of
our
lazy
weekend
agenda.It
was
all
right
.
The
vegetable
egg
roll
was
great
.
The
fried
rice
was
ok
.
I
had
chicken
lo
mein
and
the
noodles
&
vegetables
were
good
,
but
the
meat
was
yuck
.
I
'm
not
sure
what
it
is
...
I
think
I
should
only
order
items
that
do
NOT
have
meat
in
them
when
I
go
to
restaurants
,
because
I
commonly
end
up
unsatisfied
with
the
meat
and
it
ruins
the
whole
meal
.
The
checken
was
bland
,
tasteless
,
kind
of
gummy
and
some
pieces
were
extremely
gristly
.
The
fortune
cookies
were
the
good
kind
:-RRB-
and
they
gave
my
boyfriend
real
pancakes
w/his
order
-LRB-
moo
shu
pork
I
think
?
-RRB-
He
seemed
to
like
his
quite
a
bit
.
PS
it
was
delivery
,
not
eat-in
,
and
the
delivery
time
was
n't
horrible
,
but
not
super
great.I
ordered
delivery
from
this
place
.
It
took
them
about
40
min
to
deliver
,
which
I
think
is
a
standard
.
Well
,
the
food
was
alright
-
did
n't
wow
me
and
my
friend
,
but
we
did
n't
complain
about
it
either
.
I
liked
the
fact
that
they
serve
not
overly
greasy
chinese
.
We
ordered
pork
chop
suey
,
mixed
vegetable
,
and
beef
with
snow
peas
.
All
of
them
tasted
good
without
making
my
guts
feel
nauseous
.
One
thing
my
friend
and
I
did
n't
know
-
so
in
Midwest
-LRB-
or
in
Madison
only
?
-RRB-
``
chow
mein
''
is
not
a
noodle
dish
...
.
So
make
sure
to
order
``
Lo
mein
''
if
you
want
that
noodle
dish
.
Chow
mein
is
chop
suey
.
I
swear
it
's
not
like
that
in
California!This
is
my
go
to
place
for
Chinese
delivery
.
Never
actually
been
to
the
store
though
,
most
of
the
food
is
pretty
standard
,
however
the
dumplings
are
fantastic
,
they
're
all
I
order
now.No
vegetarian
options
,
and
staff
always
too
busy
and
not
personable.The
great
thing
about
China
Wok
is
it
is
exactly
what
you
'd
expect
.
It
's
your
decent
,
standard
Americanized
Chinese
fare
.
I
've
never
had
a
bad
experience
;
it
's
always
the
same
.
This
place
is
close
by
me
,
so
delivery
is
always
super
fast
.
Although
the
food
is
generally
nothing
special
,
the
fried
dumplings
hold
an
especially
,
soft
,
doughy
spot
in
my
heart.This
is
our
``
go-to
''
Chinese
restaurant
on
the
North
and
East
side
of
Madison
.
It
's
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
or
anything
but
it
's
by
far
the
best
in
the
area
in
this
price
range
.
The
food
is
not
super
greasy
or
full
of
crazy
amounts
of
that
fake
testing
Chinese
food
seasoning
some
of
the
restaurants
put
in
-LRB-
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
...
but
there
are
some
of
you
right
now
who
know
what
I
'm
talking
about
!
-RRB-
.
They
are
not
overly
helpful
on
the
phone
but
in
the
many
times
we
've
ordered
-LRB-
over
6
years
-RRB-
,
they
've
never
messed
up
on
an
order
,
are
always
within
30
minutes
of
a
delivery
time
,
and
deliver
HOT
.
We
recommend
the
orange
chicken
,
the
vegetable
lo
mein
,
and
any
form
of
tofu
--
especially
the
tofu
cashew
-LRB-
as
a
nice
vegetarian
option
-RRB-
.
I
see
that
some
people
say
there
are
n't
veggie
options
but
as
a
family
that
is
primarily
vegetarian
,
they
've
substituted
tofu
in
every
dish
without
complaint
.
And
will
make
just
about
any
dish
you
ask
.
They
may
not
appear
to
be
excited
about
doing
it
but
then
again
,
I
do
n't
think
they
get
excited
about
anything
...
They
just
do
what
they
do
--
Make
good
,
fast
,
hot
Chinese
food
.
Really
,
what
more
do
you
want?My
go
to
delivery
Chinese
spot
.
.
from
that
category
you
got
ta
know
what
to
expect
but
the
Wok
definitely
steps
it
up
over
any
other
delivery
place
that
I
know
of
in
the
area.So
far
the
best
Chinese
delivery
we
've
had
here
in
Madison
.
Their
food
is
flavorful
,
fresh
,
and
not
super-greasy
.
They
also
have
an
online
menu
to
order
from
,
which
is
amazing
!
It
makes
life
simple
,
and
I
do
n't
have
to
worry
that
I
mispronounce
something
or
said
the
wrong
thing
entirely
.
The
only
complaint
I
had
is
that
while
our
food
was
steamy
hot
,
the
crab
rangoons
were
n't
.
They
were
actually
a
little
on
the
cool
side
.
But
,
it
's
delivery
,
so
that
's
not
all
that
surprising.Tasty
.
Not
too
greasy
,
not
too
salty
.
Quick
delivery
.
Fresh
ingredients
.
Fast
delivery
...
use
the
computer
based
ordering
system
...
very
efficient
.
Overall
very
good
food
and
experience.You
know
how
you
see
a
picture
of
food
at
a
restaurant
,
you
order
it
,
only
to
have
what
is
put
on
your
plate
barely
resemble
what
you
saw
in
the
picture
?
Well
,
you
do
n't
have
to
worry
about
this
at
China
Wok
.
What
you
get
as
your
meal
looks
even
better
than
the
pictures
above
their
counter
.
I
've
dined
at
this
carry
out
Chinese
location
numerous
times
over
the
past
2
years
.
My
office
is
only
a
mile
or
so
away
and
it
makes
for
a
quick
meal
.
I
must
say
,
I
feel
like
something
has
changed
in
the
past
year
.
When
I
used
to
go
,
I
felt
like
no
matter
what
I
ordered
,
it
all
looked/tasted
the
same
.
-LRB-
ie
sauce
,
color
,
vegetables
,
etc
-RRB-
But
for
the
past
year
or
so
,
my
coworker
and
I
marvel
at
how
great
the
food
looks
when
it
comes
from
the
kitchen
.
We
primarily
dine
in
.
We
're
practically
giving
each
other
high-fives
,
because
we
feel
like
we
just
scored
big
.
And
the
flavor
is
just
as
good
as
it
looks
.
I
just
ate
at
another
carryout
Chinese
location
and
the
quality
of
food
reminded
me
how
great
China
Wok
is
,
so
I
jumped
out
to
right
this
review
.
I
regularly
get
Kung
Pao
Chicken
or
Mongolian
Beef
.
My
coworker
exclusively
gets
General
Tso
's
Chicken
-LRB-
this
thing
always
looks
amazing
!
-RRB-
Value
is
always
great
...
we
can
get
both
of
our
lunches
,
i
usually
add
an
egg
roll
-LRB-
75
cents
-RRB-
and
he
usually
gets
a
soda
and
it
costs
us
around
$
12
for
both
of
us
.
Quantity
of
food
is
also
great
.
As
you
can
tell
,
I
highly
recommend
this
place
.
Given
it
's
a
carryout
Chinese
place
,
I
really
should
give
it
5
stars
for
overcoming
such
an
obstacle!Like
most
Chinese
in
Madison
-LRB-
it
seems
-RRB-
China
Wok
is
pretty
middle
of
the
road
.
I
wo
n't
say
it
's
the
worst
I
've
had
...
that
honor
was
given
to
Wong
's
on
Atwood
,
but
it
's
certainly
not
the
best
.
I
have
3
indicators
for
good
Chinese
food
.
1
.
What
color
is
the
sweet
and
sour
sauce
?
-LRB-
It
should
n't
be
red
.
-RRB-
2
.
How
thick
are
the
crispy
noodles
?
-LRB-
They
should
n't
be
,
they
're
noodles
,
thick
``
noodles
''
are
just
fried
wonton
wrappers
.
-RRB-
3
.
What
are
their
specialties
.
-LRB-
If
they
all
sound
American
,
they
're
not
special
.
-RRB-
While
China
Wok
has
red
sauce
,
thick
noodles
and
specialties
that
I
could
probably
make
it
's
decent
when
you
're
in
a
bind
,
have
nothing
in
the
fridge
and
live
2
minutes
away
.
They
also
have
a
pretty
large
delivery
radius
,
and
it
's
only
ten
bucks
minimum
,
so
even
if
you
're
solo
you
can
probably
hit
that
mark
.
Extremely
nice
folks
though
,
so
for
convenience
and
pleasurable
peeps
,
I
'd
probably
hit
them
up
again.There
food
is
good
for
what
it
is
and
the
owners
are
great
!!
A
few
months
back
they
let
me
in
after
hours
to
order.I
need
to
give
these
guys
another
star
solely
based
on
the
fact
that
I
've
been
there
3
times
this
month
.
And
while
I
hold
my
ground
that
it
is
n't
he
best
in
town
,
the
staff
is
incredible
...
so
sweet
!
And
if
you
miss
their
crazy
5
-
$
7
lunch
specials
11-3
,
that
's
ok
,
because
dinner
specials
start
at
$
8
or
so
.
Again
,
I
've
had
better
in
town
,
but
for
fast
,
like
lightening
fast
take-out
,
it
's
fit
the
bill
on
some
colder
nights
when
I
did
n't
feel
like
leaving
the
couch
to
cook.Thanks
for
the
Chinese
Delivery
suggestion
,
Yelp
!
I
ordered
online
using
the
Beyond
Menu
app
,
which
was
simple
enough
.
Delicious
food
.
I
ordered
the
Moo
Goo
Gai
Pan
-LRB-
see
pic
-RRB-
and
Egg
Drop
Soup
.
Delivery
arrived
on-time
.
Will
order
delivery
from
here
again!China
Wok
is
my
go-to
delivery
place
for
basic
Chinese
.
When
I
just
want
some
moderately
priced
food
that
will
get
here
fast
,
fill
my
belly
with
warm
and
comforting
Asiatic
foodstuffs
,
this
is
who
I
turn
to
.
I
ca
n't
speak
for
its
authenticity
or
service
,
but
I
can
speak
for
how
often
I
find
myself
hungry
,
cold
,
and
ordering
from
China
Wok
's
online
delivery
system
.
I
do
n't
generally
care
for
Sweet
&
Sour
anything
.
That
's
not
real
food
!
Have
you
seen
that
toxic-waste
colored
,
gelatinous
red
sauce
?
That
ca
n't
be
good
for
you
.
But
on
a
friend
's
recommendation
,
I
tried
it
from
China
Wok
.
It
's
delicious
.
Somehow
the
battered
and
fried
chicken
had
not
become
soggy
during
delivery
,
and
I
found
it
was
insanely
addictive
over
pork
fried
rice
.
-LRB-
I
like
their
fried
rice
-
not
too
greasy
.
But
it
seems
to
turn
bitter
when
you
re-heat
it
the
next
day
.
-RRB-
Decent
dumplings
,
and
my
BF
seems
to
enjoy
the
spare
ribs
,
since
those
are
the
only
two
things
he
ever
orders
from
there
.
The
sauce
that
comes
with
those
dumplings
is
pretty
awesome
I
must
say
.
I
also
enjoy
the
crab
rangoons
,
though
they
are
the
very
creamy
kind
with
almost
no
actual
crab
meat
.
Ask
me
if
I
care
.
Because
I
do
n't
.
Really
,
I
've
probably
had
75
%
of
the
menu
by
now
,
and
nothing
really
sticks
out
as
``
not
good
.
''
Though
once
we
tried
the
Teriyaki
Chicken
and
found
it
to
be
pretty
dry
.
Who
knows
if
that
is
how
it
usually
is
,
since
we
only
tried
it
once
.
What
business
did
we
have
ordering
Japanese
food
from
a
Chinese
place
anyway
?
They
are
reliable
,
fairly
priced
,
good
size
portions
,
hot
when
it
arrives
,
completely
non-threatening
Chinese
.
If
I
wanted
authentic
Chinese
cuisine
,
I
'd
be
going
somewhere
for
dine-in
,
not
carry
out
.
China
Wok
delivers
,
and
makes
my
insides
happy.Good
Chinese
at
an
affordable
price
.
They
have
the
best
lunch
combos
and
the
food
is
usually
ready
for
pickup
in
10
minutes
.
My
food
is
always
hot
and
have
yet
had
any
complaints
with
consistency
.
Not
the
best
Chinese
out
there
but
for
the
price
it
's
pretty
solid!DISGUSTING
!!
I
had
lunch
there
yesterday
.
Half
way
through
there
was
a
hair
in
my
sub
.
It
looked
like
a
pubic
hair
.
I
took
up
to
the
manager
and
he
offered
to
make
me
a
new
one
.
Since
he
was
the
one
who
made
it
in
the
first
place
I
respectfully
declined
.
How
about
you
guys
where
hair
nets
or
beard
nets
.
I
will
not
go
back
to
this
place
again.Great
cousins
!
The
subs
are
always
good
and
they
have
a
grill
!
If
you
want
Cousins
,
GO
TO
THIS
ONE!I
know
I
should
n't
expect
much
from
BK
,
but
this
location
is
ridiculous
.
You
really
should
n't
even
THINK
of
going
here
during
lunch
.
They
have
ONE
cash
register
at
the
front
of
the
store
.
Not
just
one
OPEN
register
...
they
only
have
one
register
,
usually
being
operated
by
the
slowest
person
they
employ
.
The
drive-through
is
no
better
.
Cars
are
backed
up
into
the
next
parking
lot
.
If
you
insist
on
trying
to
eat
there
,
I
would
suggest
you
go
inside
to
eat
,
that
way
,
when
they
invariably
get
your
order
wrong
,
you
can
throw
it
directly
at
them
.
If
you
get
drive-through
you
will
end
up
like
me
,
paying
for
a
double
cheeseburger
only
to
get
back
to
your
desk
and
find
out
that
they
totally
screwed
you
and
only
gave
you
a
single
.
You
will
then
slam
your
fists
on
your
desk
and
start
swearing
and
get
called
into
your
boss
'
office
...
at
least
that
's
what
happened
with
me
.
YMMVRANT
:
Madison
,
get
more
fast
food
.
I
do
n't
know
how
all
these
kids
got
through
undergrad
without
a
steady
supply
of
fast
food
places
.
My
college
town
was
saturated
with
them
.
And
it
was
n't
like
an
obesity
epidemic
had
been
unleashed
in
the
student
ghetto
.
I
guess
if
you
're
a
certain
type
,
you
'd
think
it
's
great
that
Madison
forces
kids
to
stay
off
the
big
mac
meal
plan
.
I
guess
it
probably
is
.
But
it
's
certainly
a
hell
of
a
lot
less
fucking
fun
.
Responsibility
comes
on
at
an
earlier
age
for
badgers
.
It
's
got
to
when
the
weather
conspires
to
kill
you
3/4ths
of
the
year.Had
a
drive
for
a
fast
food
and
decided
to
stop
here
.
Nothing
more
,
nothing
else
.
Whopper
was
good
.
They
have
a
new
soda
machine
-
fun
to
play
withThey
recently
remodeled
and
it
looks
really
nice
inside
.
They
added
TVs
and
all
of
there
registers
actually
work
now
-LRB-
yay
!
-RRB-
They
hired
some
new
people
as
well
which
seems
to
really
be
helping
this
place
out
.
.
it
still
takes
forever
to
get
your
order
if
there
busy
but
at
least
it
's
only
when
there
busy
because
before
the
new
additions
to
the
staff
came
along
I
use
to
go
when
it
was
almost
completely
dead
and
it
would
take
15
minutes
for
me
to
get
my
food
,
so
I
can
tell
that
there
trying
but
they
still
have
a
LONG
ways
to
go.Great
update
to
your
facility
,
it
needed
it
.
As
I
am
used
to
only
getting
either
my
fries
hot
or
my
sandwich
hot
,
generally
neither
at
the
same
time
.
I
was
really
dissatisfied
that
not
one
was
hot
enough
to
eat
.
I
physically
left
my
whole
meal
and
tray
on
the
table
and
walked
out
.
No
amount
of
ketchup
could
make
me
eat
it
.
Hope
they
find
a
great
staff
so
they
can
warrant
spending
the
money
on
the
upgrade
.
I
will
probably
not
go
back
to
this
location
again.This
is
the
worst
fast
food
franchise
in
town
.
The
drive
through
is
slow
.
The
food
is
inconsistent
.
The
staff
are
ambivalent
.
Averaging
over
a
minute
per
vehicle
in
the
drive
through
is
n't
``
fast
''
.
Serving
burgers
with
mere
samples
of
the
veggies
in
the
marketing
material
demonstrates
poor
attention
to
detail
,
if
not
inventory
management
problems
.
They
ca
n't
even
consistently
pack
bags
so
that
the
fries
stay
in
their
containers
.
Why
bother
with
the
containers
at
all
if
the
fries
are
just
going
to
be
scattered
throughout
the
bag
?
The
franchises
in
Sun
Prairie
and
De
Forest
remain
``
east
side
''
options
,
but
I
'm
giving
up
on
this
location
.
Four
chances
in
two
years
,
and
they
never
got
it
right.Worst
BK
I
've
ever
been
to
.
That
may
not
sound
so
serious
considering
its
a
fast
food
place
but
its
terrible
even
by
fast
food
standards
.
Orders
take
at
least
10
minutes
to
complete
and
25
percent
of
the
time
they
come
out
wrong
.
I
do
n't
know
how
but
their
burgers
are
the
worst
,
dry
and
tasteless
.
Are
n't
these
food
products
supposed
to
be
foolproof
?
I
thought
the
renovation
would
've
brought
new
employees
and
better
service
but
this
shiny
apple
is
rotten
inside
.
Never
again.Thought
I
would
stop
at
drive
thru
for
quick
lunch
,
twenty
minute
later
with
two
cars
in
front
of
me
waiting
on
there
order
i
decided
to
leave
.
Felt
bad
for
the
cars
in
front
of
me
that
had
already
had
paid
for
their
food
.
When
I
left
the
car
behind
me
followed
as
well
.
I
stopped
here
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
ordered
inside
and
the
wait
was
probabley
just
as
long
but
they
had
money
so
I
waited
.
I
saw
that
they
had
remodeled
and
I
hoped
the
found
some
new
management
and
employees
.
The
concept
of
taking
one
order
,
then
making
that
order
before
taking
or
starting
another
order
is
not
the
concept
of
the
way
a
fast
food
restraunt
should
be
run
.
Change
the
management
and
improve
service
,
clean
the
inside
and
you
might
have
a
viable
operation
.
The
McDonalds
down
the
block
does
not
suffer
from
this
poor
management
,
just
suffers
from
the
McDonalds
food.We
have
gone
here
in
the
past
year
four
times
and
they
are
always
out
of
ice
cream
.
It
does
n't
matter
the
time
of
day
.
This
last
week
we
went
to
get
ice
cream
and
food
.
Ordered
chicken
tenders
they
were
out
.
OK
can
we
have
four
cheeseburgers
no
we
are
out
of
buns
.
Well
what
can
we
get
,
whatever
you
want
.
We
just
left
after
all
that.Not
only
the
worst
BK
franchise
I
've
ever
been
to
...
but
probably
the
worst-managed
restaurant
franchise
I
've
ever
encountered
.
It
's
a
like
a
bad
-LRB-
bad
-RRB-
movie
...
OPEN
ON
two
guys
and
a
girl
in
a
GREEN
SOUL
ordering
drive
through
from
Burger
King
on
East
Wash.
.
They
are
hungry
,
but
their
order
is
easy
.
Just
three
burgers
,
twp
fries
,
and
one
drink
.

THE
END.Well
...
this
is
definitely
Jimmy
Buffett
in
a
nutshell
...
over
the
top
wacky
and
colorful
...
a
real
escape
from
reality
.
The
food
was
great
...
kind
of
a
wait
,
but
they
were
really
busy
.
Throughout
the
meal
we
were
serenaded
with
Buffett
favorites
by
a
guy
on
guitar
.
Worth
eating
there
once
,
but
a
little
too
kitschy
to
appeal
to
me
on
a
regular
basis
.
3
stars.Ate
there
once
,
and
short
of
being
annoyed
by
all
the
silly
,
wannabe
island
retreat
crap
,
the
food
was
average
,
overpriced
,
and
it
was
the
middle
of
Wisconsin
winter
,
so
who
wants
to
be
reminded
that
it
's
3
freaking
degrees
outside
.
Actually
,
the
biggest
problem
I
had
with
this
place
was
the
extravagant
price
for
the
bland
food
.
Much
better
burgers
and
sandwiches
in
Madison
for
a
much
more
reasonable
price.Cheesy
and
totally
overrated
-
the
carribean
fare
in
a
Jimmy
Buffet
inspired
setting
is
all
good
in
theory
,
but
the
colorful
interiors
and
catchy
tunes
are
little
compensation
when
you
spend
most
of
your
time
keeping
flies
away
from
your
crappy
food
and
balancing
the
BAD
shaka-ritas
-LRB-
margarita
flights
-RRB-
on
creaky
wooden
tables
in
the
patio
.
The
food
was
uniformly
ordinary
-
my
vegetarian
baja
burger
was
way
too
spicy
to
be
enjoyable
,
the
crab-cake
burger
was
a
disaster
and
I
left
my
fries
practically
untouched
,
which
hardly
ever
happens
!
Overall
,
one
of
the
worst
restaurant
experiences
for
me.Grade
:
F
A
complete
nightmare
.
Awful
food
served
by
stupid
staff
.
Can
I
get
another
helping
of
second-hand
smoke
with
those
stupid
mini
cheeseburger
appetizers?Overrated
,
yes
.
Fun
,
yes
.
Something
different
in
a
very
Midwestern
town
,
yes
.
For
that
reason
alone
I
give
it
4
stars
.
Take
a
look
at
the
options
while
in
Middleton
,
there
is
n't
much
.
This
is
a
great
place
to
get
drunk
and
eat
a
cheeseburger
.
That
's
about
it
.
However
if
that
is
what
you
want
to
do
,
come
here
.
They
have
an
outdoor
patio
that
is
nice
in
the
evening
and
on
days
that
are
n't
too
humid
.
The
place
is
loud
and
great
for
families
.
The
place
is
not
good
for
an
intimate
setting
,
for
that
go
to
Lousianne
's
.
Back
to
the
thing
about
the
drinks
,
the
drink
list
is
enourmous
.
They
have
frozen
drinks
,
on
the
rocks
drinks
,
beer
,
liquor
,
you
name
they
have
it
.
For
those
not
from
the
midwest
,
it
is
a
nice
oasis
.
I
'll
leave
it
at
that.Nothing
spectacular
.
The
crab
cakes
were
ok
,
could
have
been
better
but
then
they
could
have
been
much
worse
.
I
decided
to
venture
out
of
my
comfort
zone
-LRB-
meaning
not
drinking
wine
-RRB-
and
had
one
of
their
specialty
drinks
...
Cheeseburger
in
Paradise
-LRB-
from
the
web
menu
``
An
island
sized
,
award
winning
signature

that
will
change
your

Layered

-LRB-
``

-RRB-
and
your
own
personal
Cheeseburger
In
Paradise
.
''
-RRB-
Not
as
huge
as
it
sounds
-LRB-
thankfully
-RRB-
and
surprisingly
very
good
.
As
for
music
,
they
played
the
occasional
Buffett
song
and
at
7:30
PM
tonight
,
there
was
live
music
.
I
had
started
my
evening
looking
for
a
local
eatery
,
but
after
driving
almost
40
miles
-LRB-
back
and
forth
-RRB-
to
get
cheese
curds
-LRB-
more
on
that
in
my
next
reviews
-RRB-
I
choose
the
first
place
that
looked
remotely
interesting.As
a
lifelong
Parrothead
,
I
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
place
.
There
was
nothing
inherently
bad
about
it
,
but
it
's
kind
of
a
PJ
McWhiskers
with
tiki
torches
.
I
've
spent
my
share
of
time
at
Margaritaville
in
Key
West
and
was
expecting
something
closer
to
that
,
I
guess
.
My
wife
and
I
grabbed
a
few
late
nite
appetizers
-LRB-
mini
cheeseburgers
and
chips
and
queso
-RRB-
and
both
were
fine
.
Nice
beer
selection
featuring
many
Wisconsin
labels
.
My
wife
got
the
overpriced
blended
margarita
which
was
tasty
.
I
do
have
to
give
them
points
for
the
bartender
who
was
working
his
tail
off
as
the
only
one
behind
the
packed
kidney-shaped
bar
.
Someone
who
I
can
only
assume
was
the
manager
on
duty
did
n't
make
any
moves
to
pitch
in
help
the
poor
guy
.
I
'm
giving
this
place
3
stars
for
the
bartender
's
effort
and
the
decent
food
.
I
'd
go
back
if
I
was
passing
by
,
but
would
n't
make
a
special
effort
to
hit
it
up
again.I
had
gone
to
a
Cheeseburger
in
Paradise
a
few
years
ago
in
suburban
IL
.
I
spent
the
evening
gazing
in
horror
,
there
was
live
music
,
and
drunken
gyrating
soccer
moms
for
MILES
.
-LRB-
or
what
seemed
like
miles
-RRB-
However
,
Cheeseburger
in
Paradise
during
dinner
rush
on
a
Thursday
eve
in
MADISON
...
was
a
different
more
chill
experience
.
Jimmy
Buffet
was
playing
constantly
over
the
sound
system
and
our
service
was
quick
and
friendly
like
any
chain
restaurant
.
The
margaritas
were
OVERPRICED
-LRB-
$
5.75
for
a
16
oz
plain
lime
margarita
on
the
rocks
-RRB-
,
and
the
food
was
okay
.
I
had
the
blackened
fish
sandwich
which
was
great
...
my
sweet
potato
chips
were
not
fresh
.
-LRB-
Pescetarians
and
vegetarian
have
LOTS
of
options
here
,
which
is
at
times
uncommon
for
Wisconsin
.
-RRB-
Staff
was
friendly
and
service
was
fairly
prompt
.
The
food
was
merely
average
and
the
``
specially
brewed
''
beer
was
weak
.
Overall
,
the
place
tries
too
hard
with
its
theme
.
The
weather
was
not
cooperating
,
but
they
still
had
the
doors
wide
open
.
This
would
have
been
a
better
day
to
leave
the
doors
down
and
keep
the
diners
inside
.
The
county
was
under
a
tornado
watch
at
the
time
and
there
were
several
severe
storms
in
the
vicinity
.
Not
a
day
to
encourage
diners
to
eat
on
the
patio.So
,
when
I
first
heard
of
Cheeseburger
in
Paradise
,
my
reaction
was
``
oh
no
,
that
's
totally
lame
,
I
'll
never
go
there
to
eat
beef
among
tiki
torches
.
''
Then
I
learned
from
my
Gluten
Free
Restaurant
Guide
by
Triumph
Dining
that
they
have
a
gluten-free
menu
,
and
then
we
were
nearby
when
my
father
announced
that
he
was
hungry
for
a
burger
and
fries
.
And
that
's
how
we
ended
up
at
Cheeseburger
in
Paradise
.
We
enjoyed
our
bun-less
burgers
and
gluten-free
french
fries
-LRB-
fried
in
a
dedicated
wheat-free
fryer
,
unlike
at
most
every
other
place
that
fries
things
-RRB-
on
the
patio
and
were
waited
on
by
a
conscientious
and
attentive
server
,
Miles
.
It
was
clean
,
colorful
,
and
goofy
and
they
fed
me
safely.This
is
like
an
Islands
chain
wannabe
,
which
happens
to
be
a
Jimmy
Buffett-owned
chain
restaurant
.
I
went
there
with
a
friend
and
business
partner
I
have
known
for
years
.
The
non-alcoholic
``
tropical
''
drink
selection
had
a
variety
of
maybe
10
drinks
and
they
all
sounded
good
.
I
had
an
``
Island
Paradise
''
-
Pineapple
and
coconut
complemented
with
pomegranate
grenadine
and
a
splash
of
Sprite
.
It
was
very
good
.
We
ordered
a
quesadilla
appetizer
and
it
was
pretty
tasty
.
There
was
plenty
of
chicken
,
cheese
,
and
vegetables
between
the
tortillas
and
the
portion
was
just
right
for
us
.
We
decided
that
we
would
both
order
something
different
so
that
we
could
share
and
try
other
foods
on
the
menu
.
I
ordered
the
``
El
Cubano
''
a
traditional
Cuban
sandwich
,
made
with
ham
,
cheese
,
roasted
pork
,
pickle
and
mustard
all
pressed
inside
two
slices
of
Cuban
bread
.
It
was
average
at
best
.
My
friend
ordered
the
BBQ
Cheddar
Burger
and
it
was
excellent
.
The
burger
is
just
as
it
sounds
,
consisting
of
a
bun
,
beef
patty
,
BBQ
sauce
cheddar
cheese
,
lettuce
and
tomatoes
,
with
fried
onions
.
He
gave
me
half
and
it
was
a
lot
better
than
the
sandwich
I
ordered
.
I
did
not
even
finish
my
half
of
the
Cuban
.
My
sandwich
did
come
with
sweet
potato
chips
which
were
pretty
good
.
I
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
sweet
potato
but
found
myself
munching
on
these
chips
.
I
do
n't
know
much
about
Jimmy
Buffett
,
but
the
name
of
this
place
is
actually
the
title
of
one
of
his
songs
.
There
are
38
locations
in
17
states
,
all
in
places
very
far
from
Hawaii
.
Maybe
it
is
n't
supposed
to
be
like
Hawaii
,
but
I
feel
like
it
looks
like
what
Hawaii
might
be
envisioned
by
someone
who
has
never
been
.
There
was
no
version
of
the
burger
made
with
pineapple
slices
and
teriyaki
sauce
...
but
maybe
that
's
because
Buffett
supposedly
wrote
``
Cheeseburger
in
Paradise
''
in
the
Carribbean
...
which
changes
everything
.
Maybe
that
's
why
they
serve
the
Cubano
,
which
was
still
subpar
at
best
.
Overall
,
the
food
was
satisfactory
.
If
I
am
ever
in
town
again
or
happen
to
pass
by
a
Cheeseburger
in
Paradise
,
I
might
go
back
because
the
drinks
are
good
and
the
burgers
are
yummy
.
It
is
a
decent
meal
that
wo
n't
break
your
wallet
,
but
take
a
hint
by
the
restaurant
's
name
and
order
a
cheeseburger
.
WWJBD
...
what
would
Jimmy
Buffett
do
?
Probably
order
a
Cheeserburger
in
Paradise
,
and
so
should
you.I
love
the
wraps
here
and
the
drinks
are
prime
!
Food
is
decently
priced
and
the
drinks
are
a
bit
more
pricey
,
but
they
taste
excellent
and
get
you
more
tipsy
than
you
'd
think
:-RRB-
I
enjoy
the
whole
island
vibe
of
the
place
especially
in
the
summer
when
you
can
sit
outside
.
They
have
some
live
music
at
times
as
well
and
the
wait
staff
has
always
been
super
friendly
to
me
.
.
I
got
so
sick
and
was
throwing
up
after
eating
there
!
I
have
never
been
back
since
.
And
normally
I
never
get
sick
to
my
stomach
.
I
do
n't
trust
their
food
.
And
it
is
so
overprized
and
overrated.No
,
No
,
Never
,
Never
,
Uh
Uh
Uh
!!!
Sorry
to
say
,
this
place
is
a
disaster
.
Not
because
the
decor
is
cheesy
,
but
because
they
are
mind
numbingly
slow
,
and
the
food
is
uber-forgettable
.
We
called
ahead
and
found
that
we
could
get
a
table
for
16
on
the
patio
,
but
when
we
got
there
at
our
appointed
time
nothing
was
ready
-
bad
first
impression
.
We
were
sat
at
four
different
tables
near
each
other
and
moved
the
tables
ourselves
to
create
a
configuration
where
our
group
could
talk
.
The
waitress
asked
a
couple
times
if
anyone
needed
anything
,
but
great
service
starts
with
keeping
water
glasses
full
,
so
if
you
see
an
empty
one
-
FILL
IT
!
That
is
decent
restaurant
skills
101
and
costs
you
a
star
every
time
.
The
food
was
cold
,
overcooked
,
tasteless
and
a
little
scary
.
I
got
a
spicy
burger
and
it
was
bland
.
The
only
way
I
would
eat
at
this
chain
again
would
be
if
I
washed
up
on
a
beach
after
being
marooned
for
a
week
and
they
were
giving
the
food
away
FREE.During
a
business
trip
in
Madison
,
we
scoped
out
some
places
to
do
dinner
afterwards
.
After
browsing
a
few
online
menus
and
seeing
that
this
place
had
pitchers
of
Sangria
,
we
decided
to
give
it
a
try
.
The
experience
here
was
pretty
middle-of-the-road
.
It
was
a
weeknight
,
and
not
very
crowded
,
so
we
had
no
problem
getting
seated
right
away
.
While
the
decor
and
the
environment
is
a
bit
much
to
stomach
,
I
honestly
enjoyed
my
cheeseburger
and
drinks
.
I
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
come
here
,
but
if
I
'm
in
the
area
and
felt
like
a
cheeseburger
,
this
place
would
be
on
the
list.If
I
could
give
NO
stars
this
would
be
the
place
that
deserves
it
.
We
were
in
on
a
Thursday
night
at
around
7pm
.
There
were
a
handful
of
patrons
-LRB-
certainly
more
staff
than
paying
customers
-RRB-
.
There
was
one
bartender
who
was
bothered
to
make
drinks
.
We
watched
him
make
a
moijto
and
when
he
poured
from
the
shaker
to
the
glass
he
spilled
some
over
including
a
lime
and
some
mint
that
went
onto
the
bar
,
he
picked
them
up
and
put
them
back
into
the
cup
.
DISGUSTING
!
Then
the
4
of
us
at
the
bar
were
ready
to
order
another
round
and
the
bartender
went
MIA
,
we
waved
down
2
waitresses
who
went
into
the
back
and
we
never
saw
them
again
,
10
minutes
later
he
came
back
and
when
asked
``
what
happened
to
you
''
,
he
responded
,
``
I
am
busy
,
I
need
to
clean
the
keg
lines
.
''
Do
n't
waste
you
time
here!The
name
of
this
place
is
deceiving
!
This
is
a
really
great
-LRB-
including
tropical
cocktails
and
non-alcohol
-RRB-
Caribbean
sandwich
,
burger
and
appetizer
place
.
Great
variety
of
tastes
and
the
caribbean
chicken
gumbo
is
excellent
!

Substitutes
?
No
problem
mon.
.
.
There
's
a
lot
of
negative
reviews
on
here
,
and
I
was
hesitant
to
go
tonight
,
but
after
hearing
a
co-worker
say
``
they
have
the
best
wings
i
've
ever
had
''
I
just
had
to
go
.
Let
's
just
say
its
hard
for
me
to
turn
down
good
chicken
wings
.
Our
party
of
four
included
two
toddlers
.
They
got
the
mini
cheeseburgers
,
which
were
average
but
good
enough
for
kids
to
eat
.
We
started
with
18
wings
split
into
three
different
sauces
.
Very
tasty
wings
.
Nice
crunch
to
them
.
We
tended
towards
the
sweet/spicy
flavors
and
they
all
did
not
dissapoint
.
They
were
better
than
BWW
,
and
better
than
most
chain
American
restaurants
.
On
a
scale
of
1-10
I
'd
give
them
a
9
.
My
wife
said
``
wow
,
they
are
pretty
darn
good
wings
.
''
My
entree
was
less
than
stellar
,
I
ordered
the
Cuban
Sandwhich
.
Having
lived
in
South
Florida
for
years
this
was
definitely
not
on
par
with
them
,
but
was
n't
a
bad
rendition
.
About
average
.
My
wife
ordered
the
Cajun
burger
,
which
she
said
had
no
spice
to
it
but
it
was
still
a
decent
burger
.
Overall
,
this
place
was
better
than
I
thought
,
nothing
spectacular
,
but
we
'd
definitely
go
back
.
Its
relatively
inexpensive
-LRB-
most
entrees
8-10
$
-RRB-
,
service
was
good
,
and
the
drink
menu
looked
great
.
They
had
this
cool
4
'
tower
of
beer
that
looked
kind
of
fun
to
drink
from
...
Amazing
place
!
Love
it
here
!
What
's
with
the
bad
reviews
?
Are
you
kidding
me
?
Best
burgers
in
the
Madison
area
,
hands
down
.
Perfect
fruity
drinks
.
Great
service
!
bottom
line
:
awesome!Nice
atmosphere
.
Cheeseburger
was
not
all
that.I
came
here
and
ordered
the
baja
burger
.
It
was
DISGUSTING
.
Greasy
,
with
wilted
vegetables
and
absolutely
dripping
with
excess
juice
.
I
could
barely
eat
it
,
but
I
was
so
hungry
that
I
just
held
my
nose
and
forced
down
a
few
bites
.
The
sweet
potato
chips
were
n't
much
better
;
too
greasy
and
stale
.
My
friend
had
a
strawberry
daiquiri
,
which
I
also
tried
.
It
was
acceptable
,
but
the
taste
was
off
.
The
service
was
n't
good
either
.
Our
waiter
neglected
us
,
and
we
did
not
feel
at
all
taken
care
of
.
I
will
not
be
back.Fun
atmosphere
and
good
for
a
round
of
drinks
.
The
food
is
okay
--
had
the
shrimp
tacos
which
were
tasty
but
the
rice
on
the
side
was
bland
,
dry
and
obviously
made
in
bulk
.
I
ate
at
the
bar
,
the
female
bartender
was
far
more
concerned
with
a
handful
of
male
regulars
and
talking
about
how
she
could
not
wait
to
go
get
drunk
.
The
other
bartender
was
overheard
complaining
about
his
work
hours
-
staff
definitely
brought
down
the
fun
atmosphere.Never
eating
here
again
.
I
was
sick
for
2
days
after
I
eat
one
of
their
burgers.Paradise
?!
Absolutely
not
!
This
place
is
a
joke
.
We
've
gone
here
a
few
times
and
each
time
confirms
the
bad
experience
preceding
.
This
place
just
does
not
serve
up
what
their
name
implies
.
When
I
go
to
a
place
called
Cheeseburger
in
Paradise
I
expect
something
above
and
beyond
the
regular
burger
down
the
street
.
Instead
,
all
they
serve
up
here
is
hamburgers
with
fancy
names
.
Every
burger
I
have
ever
ordered
here
has
been
lesser
than
any
burger
at
any
greasy
spoon
or
family
restaurant
.
I
was
hoping
they
would
have
some
steak
fries
instead
of
the
usual
basic
fries
.
Nope
.
The
burgers
are
just
that
,
basic
burgers
with
a
sauce
to
match
the
fancy
name
.
What
chef
dreamed
up
these
recipes
?
I
doubt
it
was
a
chef
.
Probably
some
person
that
said
,
``
good
enough
,
let
's
go
make
some
money
''
.
Our
burgers
yesterday
were
about
10
bucks
each
and
just
basic
burgers
that
should
have
cost
about
4
bucks
.
The
meat
did
n't
have
any
distinctive
flavor
and
was
rather
skimpy
,
the
sauce
was
not
complimentary
to
the
sandwich
and
the
bun
was
generally
regular
too
.
At
least
the
bun
was
fresh
.
I
would
only
recommend
this
place
to
my
Republican
friends
because
they
have
no
ability
to
think
for
themselves
anyway
and
might
actually
like
the
place
.
If
you
're
looking
for
paradise
you
wo
n't
find
it
here
.
Last
best
burger
I
had
was
at
Great
Dane
,
maybe
try
there
.
But
I
have
had
lame
burgers
there
too
.
Let
me
think
,
ummm
,
If
you
are
still
reading
...
DO
N'T
GO
HERE
.
Look
elsewhere.I
have
avoided
this
place
since
it
opened
,
but
a
friend
insisted
we
meet
up
there
for
dinner
.
First
thing
I
noticed
was
the
dirty
fork
in
my
silverware
set
.
It
had
definitely
gone
through
a
dishwasher
,
which
baked
on
a
nice
chunk
of
food
from
the
previous
user
.
Pointed
it
out
to
the
waiter
who
just
swapped
out
my
silverware
set
with
some
from
a
nearby
table
.
After
that
,
I
needed
a
drink
.
Ordered
a
Bud
Light
Lime
since
there
was
a
huge
banner
that
said
$
2.50
for
that
brand
all
during
May
.
Nope
,
they
were
out
and
the
waiter
said
we
could
NOT
substitute
for
another
drink
-LRB-
i.e.
a
Corona
or
something
similar
-RRB-
.
Ok
then
,
I
'll
just
order
a
$
9.39
mushroom
and
swiss
.
Food
came
and
the
fries
were
cold
.
Told
the
waiter
we
wanted
new
fries
and
he
obliged
.
The
burger
was
nothing
special
.
Should
have
been
half
the
price
we
paid
.
Then
,
after
I
'm
half
way
done
with
the
burger
,
the
waiter
returns
and
says
he
checked
with
the
manager
and
we
could
get
a
Corona
for
$
2.50
.
Too
late
.
By
this
time
,
I
just
wanted
to
leave
.
The
place
was
not
busy
at
all
,
I
'm
not
sure
what
took
him
so
long
to
check
with
the
manager
about
that
.
I
hate
these
theme
restaurants
and
this
trip
just
served
to
solidify
my
beliefs
that
gimmicky
restaurants
usually
do
not
have
good
food
.
I
'll
stick
with
5
Guys
or
Nitty
Gritty
when
I
want
a
good
burger
.
Hell
,
just
go
next
door
to
TGIFridays
,
even
they
beat
this
place.What
you
're
really
doing
is
playing
for
the
experience
.
I
had
the
mini
crab
burgers
and
they
were
pretty
good
.
The
drinks
are
good
,
but
overpriced
.
Service
was
mediocre.OK
,
I
must
start
by
saying
that
the
kids
wanted
to
go
here
and
I
was
not
that
excited
about
it
.
However
,
I
was
surprised
by
the
reasonable
beer
selection
and
the
nice
menu
.
The
food
came
out
very
slow
,
slooow
,
sloooooow
...
the
burgers
were
pretty
good
.
The
big
problem
with
Cheeseburger
was
the
service
.
We
thought
our
waiter
had
a
job
at
a
restaurant
across
town
!
He
would
disappear
for
long
periods
of
time
-LRB-
could
not
see
him
anywhere
in
the
restaurant
-RRB-
and
then
reappear
maybe
15-20
minutes
later
.
Order
food
,
where
did
he
go
?
Order
a
drink
,
where
did
he
go
?
Finish
eating
,
wait
15
minutes
for
the
check
.
Try
to
pay
the
check
,
he
wanders
off
for
another
15
minutes
with
the
credit
card
.
Not
going
back
,
even
though
the
food
was
fine.Greasy
food
,
lazy
service
,
flat
soda
.
For
a
place
the
is
supposed
to
specialize
in
burgers
they
sucked
!
The
patty
was
dry
and
over
cooked
everything
was
greasy
,
and
the
only
thing
that
was
ok
were
the
fries
but
that
is
not
a
reason
to
go.Service
and
fries
are
where
they
excel
.
We
have
been
there
5
or
6
times
and
that
's
what
stands
out
.
I
like
their
burgers
but
the
rest
of
the
menu
items
are
not
too
good
.
Not
a
place
I
am
compelled
to
visit
often.Been
there
twice
now
and
have
had
mixed
results
First
time
there
the
service
was
fast
,
which
is
nice
because
I
only
have
a
50
minute
lunch
break
,
and
the
food
was
OK
.
I
got
the
Guacamole
Bacon
burger
.
It
was
tasty
but
the
burger
itself
was
overly
greasy
.
The
toppings
were
very
good
though
so
that
saved
the
burger
Second
time
there
had
the
bigger
issues
.
Again
we
're
on
a
shorter
lunch
and
usually
they
accommodate
well
.
We
did
n't
have
anybody
come
to
our
table
for
drink
orders
for
over
10
minutes
.
2
tables
came
in
after
us
and
got
drinks
and
ordered
food
before
us
.
It
was
a
little
annoying
considering
the
place
was
n't
that
busy
when
we
sat
down
.
Again
the
good
was
OK
.
This
time
I
had
the
Sweet
Fire
Chicken
sandwich
and
it
was
better
tasting
than
the
burger
I
had
but
still
was
very
greasy
and
the
bun
was
mush
by
the
end
.
Am
willing
to
try
it
again
and
see
how
it
goes
.
Will
update
review
thenI
went
here
with
my
girlfriend
about
a
month
ago
.
I
got
the
black
&
blu
burger
and
she
got
the
guacamole
burger
.
I
thought
my
burger
was
greasy
,
as
I
was
eating
it
the
bun
started
to
fall
apart
...
the
service
was
ok
,
I
've
had
better
though
.
I
had
an
OK
experience
but
I
wo
n't
be
back.I
have
been
here
multiple
times
and
have
usually
had
great
experiences
,
but
last
night
was
awful
.
We
made
reservations
as
they
had
a
promotion
for
National
Cheeseburger
Day
and
there
were
six
of
us
.
When
my
friend
and
I
got
there
,
we
told
the
hostess
that
we
were
meeting
friends
and
had
a
reservation
under
another
friend
's
name
,
and
she
shrugged
at
us
three
times
before
asking
us
how
many
were
in
our
party
and
never
bothered
to
find
our
reservation
.
We
told
her
we
had
an
infant
with
us
,
and
she
looked
annoyed
to
have
to
accommodate
a
baby
.
She
eventually
asked
us
if
we
wanted
to
wait
for
the
others
in
our
party
or
sit
down
,
and
then
walked
us
to
our
table
and
told
us
nothing
about
who
our
server
was
or
ever
cracked
a
smile
.
We
sat
for
at
least
10
minutes
with
no
service
and
eventually
flagged
down
a
waiter
,
who
found
our
server
,
who
arrived
about
5
minutes
later
.
The
drink
service
was
incredibly
slow
,
and
the
food
service
was
okay
.
Our
burgers
were
average
,
which
was
disappointing
since
we
've
come
there
often
and
enjoyed
the
burgers
.
It
seems
their
buns
and
meat
have
changed
and
the
quality
is
not
as
good
as
it
had
been
.
A
disappointing
trip
,
and
we
likely
wo
n't
be
back
anytime
soon.Generic
chain
food
,
most
of
which
is
made
from
frozen
out
of
a
bag
ingredients
.
Do
n't
waste
your
money
or
time
.
TGI
Friday
's
or
Applebee
's
with
a
Caribbean
theme.I
was
wary
about
going
here
but
now
I
know
not
to
ever
go
again
.
The
atmosphere
was
fun
,
our
waitress
was
good
,
but
I
gave
it
one
star
because
I
got
food
poisoning
from
this
place
.
I
ordered
the
fish
and
chips
and
was
very
sick
-LRB-
stomach
pain
,
diarrhea
,
nausea
,
bloating
,
gas
-RRB-
that
night
until
the
next
couple
days
.
It
was
horrible
.
I
know
it
was
from
the
food
at
Cheeseburger
in
Paradise
.
I
will
never
go
there
again
!
I
do
n't
want
others
to
get
sick
so
that
is
why
I
am
posting
this
negative
review.If
this
is
paradise
,
I
'll
stick
with
the
mediocre
lifestyle
I
live
from
day
to
day
.
Awful
,
sums
up
my
first
impression
of
the
place
.
I
was
greeted
by
a
revolving
door
that
looked
like
the
windows
had
n't
been
cleaned
since
the
last
time
Jimmy
Buffet
was
in
town
.
We
were
seated
at
our
booth
,
but
before
I
could
slide
on
in
I
asked
if
they
would
wipe
the
liquid
off
of
the
seat
.
I
went
to
the
bathroom
and
washed
my
hands
-LRB-
the
bathroom
is
another
story
-RRB-
When
I
came
back
,
the
liquid
was
still
on
the
seat
of
the
booth
.
The
waitress
just
sluffed
off
the
fact
i
was
agitated
by
the
lack
of
customer
service
.
Seriously
.
How
hard
is
it
to
wipe
off
the
booth
.
The
food
was
decent
.
Nothing
great
,
but
ok
.
Portions
are
weak
however
.
You
'll
probably
have
to
venture
across
the
lot
to
McDonalds
for
a
Big
Mac
afterward
if
you
want
to
be
full
.
A
Big
Mac
would
probably
be
as
flavorful
as
the
burgers
served
here
.
What
irked
me
about
my
trip
here
was
the
service
.
First
was
the
lack
of
caring
when
it
came
to
the
booth
's
cleanliness
.
Second
,
I
never
got
a
refill
on
my
soda
.
For
$
2.49
,
I
'm
sure
jimmy
could
afford
another
glass
of
soda
.
It
took
our
waitress
nearly
10
minutes
to
collect
come
back
with
our
bill
.
It
was
like
they
took
my
debit
card
and
walked
to
my
bank
instead
of
swiping
it
to
collect
payment
.
They
get
two
stars
because
I
did
n't
have
to
choke
down
the
food
.
However
I
think
I
'd
rather
get
in
my
old
car
,
drive
to
McDonalds
,
and
risk
the
chance
I
get
explosive
diarrhea
before
climbing
into
a
sailboat
and
pointing
it
toward
Cheeseburger
In
Paradise.Decent
restaurant
with
plenty
of
fishes
,
seafood
and
chicken
on
menu
.
I
dont
eat
pork
or
beef
.
Loved
it.I
have
always
loved
this
place
BUT
the
last
3
times
I
have
visited
I
have
had
TERRIBLE
service
and
last
night
was
the
icing
on
the
cake
!!!!
Last
night
-LRB-
Thursday
-RRB-
we
arrived
at
10:20
pm
for
a
late
dinner
after
a
show
.
Since
they
were
supposed
to
close
at
11:00
pm
we
figured
it
was
enough
time
to
eat
.
When
we
walked
in
there
were
only
three
other
tables
of
people
,
one
of
which
was
a
couple
that
came
in
right
before
us
.
We
waited
at
the
host
stand
for
3
minutes
and
finally
were
greeted
by
the
bartender
.
He
took
us
to
our
table
and
told
us
our
waitress
would
be
with
us
shortly
.
The
only
server
left
-LRB-
female
,
dark
brown
hair
-RRB-
came
over
and
rushed
her
greeting
by
acting
annoyed
that
we
were
there
.
She
took
our
order
and
ran
off
to
start
doing
the
close
prep
.
5
minutes
later
she
came
back
to
our
table
and
said
that
the
bar
was
closing
-LRB-
10:30
pm
-RRB-
and
that
we
could
n't
get
frozen
drinks
.
She
asked
if
we
were
interested
in
ordering
another
type
of
drink
but
we
declined
.
She
then
acted
annoyed
that
we
did
n't
want
something
other
than
water
!
Our
food
quickly
came
out
and
it
was
WONDERFUL
-LRB-
thankfully
-RRB-
but
our
waitress
never
came
back
to
check
on
us
.
I
ran
out
of
water
and
just
as
I
was
putting
my
napkin
down
she
came
over
with
another
glass
.
At
that
time
we
asked
for
our
check
.
We
were
so
mad
about
the
quality
of
the
service
that
we
just
wanted
to
get
out
of
there
.
We
ended
up
walking
out
the
door
at
11:00
pm
on
the
dot
!
My
partner
and
I
always
tip
a
min
of
20
%
but
often
if
we
like
someone
we
will
tip
way
above
.
Our
service
was
so
terrible
that
we
left
her
a
15
%
tip
with
a
note
explaining
how
uncomfortable
she
made
our
visit
.
If
she
had
one
ounce
of
sweetness
to
her
we
would
've
given
her
20
%
BUT
she
was
cold
and
distant
.
I
understand
wanting
to
get
off
of
work
but
at
least
fake
a
smile
and
a
personality
.
I
will
not
be
coming
back
.
Yes
,
the
food
was
amazing
BUT
bad
service
equals
a
no
go
in
my
book
.
Also
,
why
close
the
bar
30
minutes
early
????
The
drinks
are
around
$
8
so
do
the
math
on
how
much
you
are
losing
if
our
table
would
've
ordered
2-4
drinks
.
I
'm
just
beyond
put
off.Grade
:
C
Decent
.
Nothing
offensive
but
nothing
memorable
either.Average
Italian
menu
items
and
good
service
in
a
nice
setting
.
Try
the
steaks
they
are
very
good
for
the
price
.
Staff
is
also
very
good
with
children.We
went
here
on
a
Friday
night
so
it
was
extremely
busy
,
which
is
to
be
expected
.
However
management
obviously
did
n't
plan
staffing
well
because
the
waitresses
were
in
a
frenzy
trying
to
keep
up
.
Our
particular
waitress
was
clearly
unnerved
and
looked
miserable
.
It
was
n't
hard
to
see
that
she
did
n't
want
to
make
small
talk
,
she
just
wanted
you
to
hurry
up
and
order
.
So
we
did
.
It
took
a
really
long
time
for
the
food
to
come
up
.
We
waited
at
least
45
minutes
for
our
main
entrees
.
The
food
was
just
ok
,
and
our
waitress
messed
up
my
dining
companion
's
order
and
when
we
asked
about
it
she
was
like
,
``
oh
sorry
!
''
as
she
dashed
away
and
that
was
the
end
of
that
.
So
the
food
was
average
,
not
great
.
The
service
was
rushed
and
unfriendly
.
Not
worth
the
price.disappointing
.
server
was
nice
and
pretty
attentive
but
that
's
about
all
good
i
can
say
about
this
place
.
we
ordered
an
appetizer
of
mozzarella
sticks
that
were
pretty
decent
but
nothing
to
rave
over
.
while
we
were
still
eating
them
,
our
tomato
basil
soup
arrived
so
i
had
to
juggle
which
one
i
wanted
to
eat
before
they
got
cold
.
it
turns
out
,
i
did
n't
much
care
for
the
soup
so
that
was
an
easy
choice
.
mid-way
through
the
appetizer/soup
course
,
viola
!
our
main
course
arrived
.
i
admit
,
it
's
a
pet
peeve
of
mine
to
get
food
before
i
'm
ready
for
it
.
.
so
that
's
a
big
part
of
why
this
restaurant
is
not
my
favorite
.
however
,
the
dishes
we
got
were
n't
particularly
good
either
.
i
got
the
spinach
chicken
ravioli
with
marinara
on
three
and
alfredo
on
the
other
three
.
the
chicken
did
n't
seem
quality
and
it
was
stuck
in
the
raviolis
in
chunks
and
it
distracted
from
the
consistency
of
it
as
a
dish
.
my
beau
's
steak
was
inedible
.
his
first
bite
was
gristle
--
so
much
so
that
he
had
to
spit
it
back
out
.
he
only
managed
to
gnaw
through
half
the
steak
.
.
and
i
think
he
did
that
only
because
he
was
so
hungry
.
he
asked
for
it
medium-rare
and
it
came
so
rare
that
,
if
it
was
me
,
i
would
have
definitely
sent
it
back
to
be
cooked
more
.
overally
,
i
was
just
disappointed
by
benvenuto
's
.
bummer.Gave
it
four
stars
last
time
.
Food
and
service
has
gone
down
hill
since
then
.
The
specials
are
absolutely
atrocious
and
old
standbys
we
used
to
like
are
lower
quality
.
Skip
this
place.OK
.
It
is
not
a
5-star
place
.
But
I
had
to
give
the
5
stars
in
order
to
offset
the
ratings
to
date
.
I
went
there
because
the
Isthmus
Annual
Manual
said
it
had
great
wood-oven
pizzas
.
I
ordered
their
signature
Benvenutos
pizza
-LRB-
with
ingredients
similar
to
some
chain
places
'
``
supreme
''
-RRB-
and
tap
water
.
This
was
an
extraordinary
pizza
.
The
crust
was
explosive
,
the
ingredients
were
pleasing
-LRB-
I
went
to
a
boutique
,
Sicilian-personally-owned
pizza
place
in
Madison
last
week
-
-
which
I
charitably
did
not
rate
on
Yelp
-
-
where
the
otherwise-droolingly-pretty
and
well-assembled
aggregations
somehow
tasted
plain
and
DULL
-
-
you
have
to
BUY
good
basic
INGREDIENTS
-RRB-
.
The
truly
odd
thing
about
Benvenutos
are
the
aesthetics
.
It
is
situated
on
a
desperate
strip
mall
,
with
a
hideous
bland
exterior
,
that
makes
you
think
it
is
some
pretend
restaurant
,
living
on
pretentions
alone
.
The
pretentions
continue
as
you
go
to
the
giant
counter
.
And
then
there
is
this
quasi-industrial
interior
,
with
huge
industrial
ceiling-fanned
ceilings
,
cute
semi-Vegas-italian
-
buffet
faux-italain
scrawlings
on
the
strange
pompous
facades
,
all
amidst
these
massive
spatial
proportions
that
are
wholly
intimidating
,
and
make
you
think
you
are
either
in
some
very
,
very
SPECIAL
hallowed
unknown
reclusive
monastery
purveying
mama
's
most
lustrous
home-style
concoctions
-LRB-
which
you
know
is
n't
true
-RRB-
,
or
you
are
in
the
most
prepostrous
strip-mall
farce
that
has
ever
been
created
It
's
a
little
of
each
,
but
amidst
this
aggregation
of
disparate
elements
,
the
proof
is
in
the
pizza
,
and
the
pizza
is
incredibly
good
.
A
billowing
perfect
crust
-
-
superb
textures
all
around
-
-
ingredients
with
satisfying
flavor

-

PERFECTLY

-RRB-

Nice
serrvice
.
I
'm
going
back.It
is
completely
and
totally
awful
.
The
food
is
hideous
.
Do
n't
go
there
,
you
will
thank
me.Good
,
reliable
Italian
food
.
A
surprisingly
nice
restaurant
for
this
neighborhood
.
I
often
order
the
lemon-basil
salmon
,
done
medium
,
and
I
like
it
a
lot
.
Risky
to
order
fish
at
an
Italian
restaurant
,
but
it
's
mostly
very
good
.
Pizza
is
terrific
,
too.I
've
never
had
a
bad
meal
here
.
Pasta
is
always
perfect
,
the
pizza
is
wonderful
and
the
calzones
are
huge
and
excellent
.
I
had
my
rehearsal
dinner
here
for
a
pizza
party
and
it
was
TOP
NOTCH
.
I
'm
still
getting
comments
about
how
good
the
pizza
was
.
The
service
for
that
large
party
and
whenever
its
just
the
hubby
and
I
has
always
been
great
.
DO
NOT
miss
the
Tiramisu
here!The
prices
are
extremely
high
,
i
went
here
tonight
with
my
mom
and
i
did
n't
even
order
anything
because
of
the
prices
,
-LRB-
$
15
for
a
plate
of
pasta
?
...
Methinks
not
!
-RRB-
my
mom
got
calamari
and
it
was
really
overcooked
-LRB-
i
posted
a
picture
!!
-RRB-
she
also
ordered
a
fish
sandwich
and
the
fish
was
literally
half
the
size
of
the
bun.Easy
to
get
a
reservation
on
about
30
minute
's
notice
.
Promptly
seated
,
very
attentive
staff
,
nice
but
simple
drink
,
beer
,
and
wine
list
.
Appetizers
,
salads
and
entrees
all
presented
promplty
and
fresh
from
the
kitchen
.
Food
quality
was
excellent
.
Very
accomodating
of
our
unruly
4
year
old
and
slightly
late
guests
.
Attached
to
the
Holiday
Inn
and
the
only
real
problem
was
the
dhared
parking
,
as
we
were
staying
at
the
hotel
and
eating
at
the
restaurant
,
but
had
trouble
getting
a
parking
spot
due
to
another
hotel
event
eating
up
all
the
spots
for
both
business
.
Nice
but
nothing
special
in
atmosphere
and
surroundings
.
Would
definitely
go
back
for
the
food
next
time
we
are
staying
in
the
hotel
or
a
nearby
hotel
,
but
probably
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
just
for
the
food.We
go
to
Benvenuto
's
a
couple
times
a
month
after
work
for
drinks
.
The
bartenders
are
always
friendly
and
efficient
.
Such
a
gem
to
have
on
the
Northside
of
Madison.I
wish
I
could
give
this
place
no
stars
.
The
place
was
nasty
,
food
had
no
flavor
,
desserts
were
freezer
burnt
,
and
the
only
thing
good
was
the
McDonald
's
we
had
after
we
left
this
place
disappointed!Disgusting
!
I
'd
rather
eat
McDonald
's
over
this
place!The
food
is
always
good
.
The
beers
are
cheap
and
the
service
is
above
average
.
It
is
not
the
cheapest
place
to
eat
but
it
is
worth
the
price
.
Last
time
we
ate
there
we
spent
less
than
forty
bucks
for
two
people
with
beers
and
tipI
've
been
to
this
place
a
few
times
,
most
recently
at
a
dinner
at
the
beginning
of
a
bachelorette
party
.
I
think
this
is
a
very
decent
option
for
someplace
on
the
north
east
side
.
For
the
party
,
they
were
very
accommodating
for
a
larger
group
and
us
adding
our
own
decorations
to
the
tables
.
The
gals
hosting
the
party
had
planned
it
with
the
restaurant
and
had
a
fixed
menu
with
three
options
available
for
everyone
.
It
worked
out
really
nicely
for
our
party
and
the
food
was
pretty
tasty
.
I
do
n't
remember
exactly
what
I
got
but
I
do
remember
enjoying
the
boxed
up
leftovers
when
I
was
hungover
the
next
morning
.
The
service
was
very
good
considering
we
were
a
boisterous
group
of
about
20
ladies
.
I
was
having
an
ice
tea
craving
that
day
and
think
I
went
through
about
8
glasses
of
the
stuff
while
we
were
there
.
The
two
waitresses
helping
our
table
we
spot
on
.
They
even
allowed
us
to
bring
in
our
own
cake
and
provided
plates
for
serving
it
.
Overall
,
I
think
it
's
decent
basic
Italian
food
,
but
really
good
at
handling
larger
parties
if
you
call
ahead.Expectations
were
n't
high
as
I
realized
it
was
a
chain
but
it
is
a
definite
step
above
Olive
Garden
or
places
like
that
.
I
did
n't
feel
like
going
out
and
this
was
the
restaurant
in
the
hotel
so
I
figured
I
would
give
it
a
go
.
Glad
I
did
because
they
served
me
one
of
the
best
fried
calamari
dishes
I
have
yet
to
have
.
Excellent
batter
,
tender
Calamari
,
top
notch
really
.
The
Penne
Supreme
dish
was
good
as
well
.
I
would
definitely
try
if
I
were
in
the
area
and
would
go
back
if
I
were
in
the
same
hotel
and
did
not
feel
like
going
out
.
I
believe
they
do
the
room
service
for
this
Holiday
Inn
Suites
but
you
might
want
to
check
first.Had
to
wait
a
little
bit
to
be
seated
this
past
time
I
went
.
But
nothing
to
horrible
.
Prices
are
a
little
high
but
the
staff
is
always
friendly
and
the
food
always
tastes
really
good
.
Will
definitely
go
back
again.Benvenutos
is
exactly
what
you
'd
expect
of
an
Americanized
``
Italian
''
restaurant
.
They
've
got
your
fresh
baked
bread
with
olive
oil
,
a
wide
variety
of
parmesan
filled
or
topped
pastas
,
a
bunch
of
red
wine
that
does
n't
technically
go
with
your
meal
,
and
some
ridiculously
cheesy
music
that
really
only
should
be
played
in
a
movie
when
someone
is
riding
a
gondola
in
Venice
.
Sometimes
this
is
exactly
what
you
want
,
a
definite
dad
pleaser
for
my
family
.
Sometimes
you
want
something
that
actually
comes
from
Italy
,
which
probably
could
n't
be
further
from
the
menu
here
.
Tonight
I
had
a
six
ounce
sirloin
with
some
seasoned
veggies
.
The
sirloin
was
medium
rare
as
requested
,
but
pretty
charred
on
the
outside
.
I
suppose
ill
stick
to
pasta
next
time
,
it
's
what
they
do
the
most
of
.
I
also
tried
their
chili
which
was
good
but
had
no
kick
at
all
.
Perhaps
they
meant
minestrone
?
The
best
part
of
the
meal
was
the
fresh
bread
.
I
mean
that
not
as
knock
to
the
meal
and
more
as
a
compliment
to
the
bread
.
It
was
seasoned
really
well
and
had
a
nice
hardness
to
the
outside
to
give
it
an
awesome
texture
.
Great
starter
!
The
service
was
about
as
good
as
you
can
get
from
a
restaurant
that
had
their
waiters
write
on
your
table
in
classy
crayon
.
The
place
looks
nicer
than
a
Chilis
,
but
when
they
start
the
meal
by
demonstrating
your
tablecloth
is
actually
a
roll
of
paper
it
sets
the
tone
for
a
pretty
laid
back
meal.I
went
to
the
Benvenuto
's
on
the
south
sidee
,
you
can
see
my
review
there
,
but
this
is
nothing
special
.
My
cousins
and
I
ate
here
before
a
movie
with
their
friend
.
They
like
it
,
and
they
have
the
bread
that
's
pretty
good
,
but
the
menu
is
n't
really
the
same
and
I
was
disappointed
that
they
had
only
three
soup
options
.
For
an
appetizer
,
they
give
you
a
pretty
decent
tasting
bread
.
It
's
soft
and
there
is
olive
oil
to
go
with
it
.
They
brought
us
two
baskets
for
our
table
of
4
.
Not
bad
.
I
wanted
to
order
soup
,
but
all
they
had
was
Tomato
Basil
and
Minestrone
.
Neither
of
those
sounded
really
appealing
so
I
ordered
Portabella
Penne
.
She
asked
if
I
wanted
a
salad
or
soup
to
add
,
and
I
asked
what
my
options
were
.
It
's
a
house
salad
or
a
Caesar
salad
,
but
there
is
an
upcharge
,
which
she
did
n't
tell
me
.
I
thought
perhaps
it
was
like
Olive
Garden
and
it
came
with
the
meal
,
but
no
.
It
was
extra
.
As
I
said
in
my
other
location
,
definitely
order
the
dressing
on
the
side
.
I
practiced
that
again
and
boy
was
I
happy
I
did
or
it
would
have
been
drowning
.
Overall
,
it
was
n't
terrible
,
but
it
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
.
I
would
n't
go
there
again
if
I
did
n't
have
to.In
fairness
,
I
'd
give
a
3.5
for
this
place
.
It
was
n't
a
4
star
place
though
,
hence
rounding
down
.
I
read
reviews
before
going
and
had
an
idea
what
to
expect
.
My
husband
got
the
pizza
and
I
got
the
pasta
plus
the
sample
platter
appetizer
.
The
pizza
was
the
star
,
with
good
quality
ingredients
and
nice
thin
crust
.
The
pasta
was
disappointing
at
best
.
I
got
the
bruschetta
chicken
pasta
which
sounded
really
good
and
looked
pretty
.
However
,
there
was
just
about
nothing
on
the
plate
but
a
huge
pile
of
pasta
.
Not
well
seasoned
,
no
where
near
enough
sauce
to
coat
even
half
of
the
pasta
.
Two
measly
pieces
of
grilled
chicken
.
I
regretted
my
order
almost
immediately
.
The
sample
platter
was
ridiculously
huge
.
Seriously
enough
for
4
+
people
to
get
full
.
I
was
unimpressed
with
everything
on
the
platter
,
especially
the
cheese
bread
.
Not
good
seasoning
,
tasted
like
fake
butter
with
too
much
cheese
left
me
feeling
greasy
.
And
I
LOVE
cheese
.
With
leftovers
,
we
had
food
for
3
days
.
The
waiter
was
hard
to
find
and
did
n't
keep
our
water
full
.
The
unlimited
bread
was
decent
with
an
olive
oil
herb
dipping
sauce
.
I
would
go
back
for
the
pizza
so
in
the
end
,
this
place
is
saved
by
the
pie.We
have
been
dining
here
for
quite
a
few
years
now
.
It
has
consistently
good
food
.
The
pizza
is
fantastic
.
They
do
n't
have
an
increased
topping
charge
for
``
gourmet
''
toppings
like
basil
.
I
find
that
annoying
at
other
restaurants
.
They
do
not
skimp
on
toppings
either
.
I
ordered
basil
and
got
plenty
of
it
.
Not
just
a
few
pieces
strewn
about
.
We
have
always
enjoyed
our
meals
here
.
The
salmon
tasted
fresh
and
the
pasta
is
very
good
.
They
have
specials
and
change
up
the
menu
on
occasion
.
The
service
is
always
great
.
Everyone
there
seems
happy
to
serve
you
,
not
just
doing
their
job
.
We
have
had
them
cater
a
lunch
for
about
50
people
at
work
and
they
did
an
excellent
job
.
They
accommodated
for
a
special
diet
restriction
without
reservation
.
It
is
not
fair
to
compare
this
place
to
an
Italian
restaurant
in
Chicago
or
any
other
big
city
.
If
you
want
Chicago
Italian
food
,
go
to
Chicago
.
I
would
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
place
to
eat
with
good
service.I
could
n't
find
Taco
City
but
the
Rocky
's
/
TacoCity
are
the
same
business
.
The
soft
shell
tacos
are
small
I
'm
used
to
big
hungry-man
's
portion
of
tacos
.
Did
they
change
the
size
?
It
seemed
to
take
forever
in
the
drive-thru
and
I
was
the
only
customer
in
line
.
Do
they
just
fool-around
since
their
used
to
closing
so
early
.
It
was
right
after
8pm
but
not
close
to
9pm
.
I
always
order
my
pizza
thru
pickup
so
I
'm
surprised
they
have
n't
shut
down
yet
.
What
would
I
do
if
they
shut
down?The
drive
thru
is
the
issue
here
...
One
word
SLOW
.
I
'm
a
huge
Rockys
fan
but
I
'll
drive
to
the
east
side
location
bc
this
location
is
just
way
too
slow
!
It
takes
a
solid
10-15
min
.
For
the
drive
thru
and
sometimes
the
pizza
is
old
and
nasty
bc
its
sat
too
long
.
It
's
too
bad
bc
there
's
not
alot
of
competition
on
the
north
side.they
are
now
CLOSED
FOR
BUSINESS
!
You
have
to
go
to
the
eastside
one
now
if
you
want
to
have
Rocky
's
.
Really
efficient
denny
's
!
Great
in
a
pinch.Great
staff
,
open
24-7
,
clean
,
and
they
have
security
there
at
night
so
when
things
started
to
get
shaky
with
certain
customers
they
fix
the
issue
fastHorrible
food
.
It
takes
real
effort
to
botch
up
a
turkey
sandwich
...
so
because
of
their
obvious
diligence
in
that
regard
,
I
'm
giving
them
one
star.It
's
Denny
's
.
What
can
I
say
.
Typical
chain
food
.
Service
is
good
.
Kids
love
it
.
Comfortable
atmosphere
.
Prices
are
low.For
starters
,
this
place
has
a
very
strong
moldy
smell
to
it
.
From
looking
at
the
old
stained
carpets
,
this
seems
where
it
may
be
comming
from
.
Next
,
I
ordered
a
soda
and
my
glass
was
dirty
and
had
oily
stains
from
it
.
I
've
been
to
other
Denny
's
Resturants
,
but
this
by
far
is
the
dirtiest
establishment
I
've
been
to
.
I
was
afraid
to
try
the
food
,
fearing
that
the
Kitchen
-LRB-
shielded
from
view
-RRB-
would
be
worse
than
what
customers
are
able
to
see
.
I
would
recommend
someone
inspect
the
air
quality
and
cleaniness
of
this
establishment.My
favorite
place
for
fast
food
in
Madison
-
I
have
both
locations
in
my
cell
phone
for
quicker
pickup
.
If
it
's
Thursday
try
the
Shrimp
in
Cream
Sauce
or
Crawfish
in
Cream
Sauce
special
...
any
other
day
,
the
Red
Beans
'n'
Rice
with
Double
Sausage
will
never
treat
you
wrong!Arguably
the
best
thing
about
Madison
.
Real
.
Legit
.
Not
Playing
.
Close
your
eyes
,
bite
into
the
shrimp
etouffee
,
and
you
feel
like
the
gulf
is
close.I
lived
near
the
Monroe
St.
location
and
frequented
this
place
regularly
.
Everything
is
super
fresh
and
authentic
.
I
was
always
a
big
fan
of
the
crawfish
etoufee
with
a
big
slab
of
cornbread
.
The
spice
could
be
a
little
inconsistent
though
,
which
is
probably
a
result
of
having
super
fresh
spices
one
time
and
then
not
the
next
time
.
No
big
deal
though
as
it
was
always
delicious
either
way
.
I
regret
that
I
have
never
had
a
po
'
boy
from
this
place
,
but
that
is
something
I
will
have
to
remedy
ASAP
.
I
also
wish
that
it
was
easier
to
eat
at
the
place
.
I
know
it
is
takeout
,
but
it
always
sucked
having
to
walk
home
smelling
the
beautiful
aromas
roll
out
of
the
box
.
Or
,
alternatively
when
it
was
40
below/snowing/raining
/
etc.New
Orleans
Take
Out
is
all
around
greatness
.
I
absolutely
love
this
place
and
everything
on
the
menu
.
When
I
was
a
kid
the
best
times
were
when
my
father
would
take
an
afternoon
delivery
to
the
east
side
and
swing
by
NOTO
on
the
way
back
.
It
was
always
such
a
great
surprise
when
my
sister
and
I
would
be
called
in
for
dinner
,
and
right
away
you
could
smell
those
spices
!
Those
are
some
of
my
favorite
memories
,
and
to
this
day
I
get
a
rush
of
excitement
just
walking
in
to
the
place
when
I
get
that
first
waft
...
It
really
is
the
best
outside
of
the
Gulf
.
I
really
ca
n't
even
start
on
what
my
favorites
are
because
every
time
I
pick
something
off
the
menu
it
becomes
my
new
favorite
.
The
po
'
boys
are
without
exception
great
.
The
roast
beef
was
my
first
love
,
and
I
keep
coming
back
to
this
one
.
The
French
bread
is
perfect
-
crisp
and
the
perfect
texture
for
the
sandwich
.
It
took
me
a
while
to
try
the
fried
oyster
po
'
boy
-
I
was
not
so
adventurous
as
a
kid
-
but
after
trying
this
I
see
why
this
is
my
mother
's
favorite
.
The
Gulf
shrimp
and
the
fried
chicken
are
incredible
.
This
place
is
a
5
star
easily
on
the
strength
of
the
po
'
boys
alone
,
but
the
rest
of
the
menu
is
not
to
be
skipped
.
The
jambalaya
is
great
for
those
that
ca
n't
take
too
much
heat
,
and
even
better
with
a
bit
of
Tabasco
for
those
that
can
.
The
shrimp
creole
-
HOO
BOY
!
Spicy
but
not
excessive
,
it
has
enough
heat
to
get
you
sweating
and
the
flavors
are
spot
on
.
Same
for
the
shrimp
etouffee
.
The
red
beans
&
rice
with
double
sausage
is
my
all-time
favorite
comfort
food
.
Most
of
the
time
I
ca
n't
make
up
my
mind
,
so
I
hit
up
the
Mardi
Gras
combo
,
which
gives
you
all
three
.
Perfection
!
And
it
all
comes
with
a
piece
of
cornbread
to
finish
it
all
off
.
I
've
only
been
to
the
Fordem
location
,
though
there
is
another
on
Monroe
Street
.
I
'm
certain
that
had
I
not
graduated
prior
to
this
location
opening
I
would
have
made
it
a
regular
destination
.
As
it
is
,
I
love
coming
down
Sherman
then
Fordem
,
and
you
're
suddenly
right
there
looking
at
the
mural
on
the
side
of
the
building
.
I
call
ahead
whenever
I
plan
to
stop
,
but
about
half
the
time
it
is
straight
up
impulse
that
brings
me
there
.
No
matter
whatever
else
happens
that
day
,
it
's
always
a
good
day
if
you
've
been
to
New
Orleans
Take
Out.I
've
never
been
to
New
Orleans
,
so
I
do
n't
know
if
that
makes
me
somehow
less
qualified
to
review
this
place
.
But
,
I
suspect
a
fair
amount
of
people
have
never
been
to
China
,
and
it
does
n't
stop
them
from
reviewing
PF
Changs
.
ANYWAY
,
the
thing
about
NOTO
whenever
I
have
eaten
there
is
that
I
am
always
expecting
it
to
be
way
greater
than
it
really
is
because
of
the
way
people
talk
about
it
.
I
am
always
expecting
this
transcendent
experience
,
but
really
,
all
I
get
is
a
styrofoam
container
of
some
spicy
slop
that
really
has
no
real
flavor
underneath
the
initial
tongue
shock
of
cayenne
pepper.This
is
definitely
the
place
for
Cajun
.
When
you
go
in
there
I
want
you
to
expect
a
special
of
the
day
,
homemade
lemonade
,
and
a
everything
made
from
scratch
type
feel
.
This
is
n't
a
place
where
you
meet
a
hostess
and
they
seat
you
.
Just
expect
the
best
beans
and
rice
outside
of
New
Orleans.I
am
kind
of
in
love
with
this
place
.
The
chicken
po
'
boy
has
haunted
me
ever
since
I
left
Madison
back
in
2000
-
perfect
french
roll
,
mayo
,
lettuce
,
tomato
,
pickle
,
and
seasoned
fried
chicken
breast
=
what
you
need
.
Also
what
you
need
?
an
order
of
dirty
rice
.
And
that
shit
is
spicy
!
Get
a
soda
from
the
machine
out
front
and
walk
to
Tenny
Park
.
Life
is
good.back
in
my
younger
days
of
bakery
,
I
worked
at
the
bakery
that
supplied
NOTO
with
french
bread
.
It
had
to
be
a
certain
length
,
a
certain
crust
,
and
a
certain
color
if
it
was
n't
...
...
...
...
.
.
YIKES
!!
I
figured
if
he
had
such
a
high
standard
of
quality
for
his
bread
,
that
the
same
mind
of
detail
would
apply
to
his
food
,
and
I
was
right.
,
I
used
to
eat
at
his
restuarant
faithfully
every
week
...
then
i
moved
:-LRB-
I
was
in
town
so
I
stopped
in
on
friday
for
some
lunch
.
The
food
was
excellent
.
I
ordered
the
fried
fish
with
sauce
pecan
meuniere
and
the
fried
cod
po
'
boy
.
The
bread
was
ok
-LRB-
I
stand
by
the
bread
we
used
to
make
years
ago
...
it
was
just
perfect
-RRB-
,
the
fish
was
fried
to
perfection
and
the
lettuce
,
tomato
,
and
pickle
were
just
right
.
as
for
the
fried
fish
with
the
pecan
sauce
,
I
got
a
half
order
.
was
n't
enough
.
I
had
forgotten
just
how
great
the
sauce
with
the
rice
and
the
fish
really
were
.
Go
here
for
some
great
food.One
of
my
all
time
favorite
places
in
Madison
;
I
like
it
so
much
that
I
had
them
cater
my
wedding
.
I
have
been
eating
at
NOTO
for
at
least
20
years
,
and
the
food
is
consistently
good
.
I
always
have
a
hard
time
deciding
what
to
get
...
the
shrimp
etouffee
?
A
shrimp
po
'
boy
with
Creole
sauce
?
Or
one
of
the
daily
specials
like
the
pecan
fish
or
the
Cajun
meatballs
?
The
cornbread
is
also
worth
noting
for
its
yumminess.I
'm
a
total
foodie
and
Chicago
is
great
for
me
except
we
do
n't
have
NOTO
.
The
best
of
the
best
for
Creole/Cajun
.
Lived
down
south
,
been
to
N'awlins
many
times
when
I
was
a
kid
in
the
70
's
.
NOTO
is
the
best
hands
down
.
Wish
some
adventuresome
entrepreneur
would
migrate
NOTO
down
to
Chicago
.
It
would
be
a
huge
success
I
am
sure
.
We
do
n't
have
anything
that
is
even
close
to
as
good
so
we
have
to
make
our
own
or
take
a
trip
up
to
Madison
!
:
-RRB-
Ever
since
my
husband
-LRB-
native
to
Madison
-RRB-
took
me
here
,
I
always
make
several
trips
out
from
Chicago
every
year
...
otherwise
my
cravings
for
the
Shrimp
Creole
,
Red
Beans
and
Rice
with
double
sausage
,
Gumbo
,
Chicken
Po
'
Boy
,
Jambalaya
,
and
really
anything
else
Roussos
has
got
goin
'
on
that
day
...
will
cause
me
to
go
into
NOTO
withdrawal
.
Oh
!
And
who
can
forget
the
Panola
hot
sauce
he
uses
!
There
is
so
much
soul
in
this
food
and
super
flavor
,
but
really
it
's
Roussos
'
own
personal
touch
that
makes
it
so
unique
.
The
food
is
truly
special
.
So
get
yo
'
self
out
to
NOTO
but
make
sure
to
bring
your
appetite!this
place
is
on
my
list
at
least
a
couple
times
a
month
,
and
it
's
probably
the
only
restaurant
in
madison
that
can
claim
that
.
The
only
thing
I
've
got
to
say
on
the
negative
side
is
the
crawfish
off
season
are
a
bit
mealy
and
I
have
switched
to
shimp
.
everything
else
is
spot
on
,
esp
the
read
beans
and
rice
.
oh
,
and
it
's
closed
on
sunday
...
which
is
always
the
day
you
start
to
crave
a
po
'
boy
.
What
do
I
say
you
get
.
for
2
ppl
,
we
get
a
full
order
of
shrimp
etoufee
,
shimp
creole
and
a
red
bean
and
rice
double
meat
.
all
with
french
bread
.
it
's
a
ton
of
food
but
oh
so
good.My
boyfriend
and
I
discuss
food
often
and
he
talked
about
his
place
with
reverence
always
.
Well
OMG
.
.
it
REALLY
is
special
.
A
simple
chicken
poboy
made
right
.
.
Dipping
it
into
certain
soups
of
the
day
-LRB-
curry
chicken
and
creole
cheeseburger
were
my
favorites
-RRB-
.
We
call
them
dipping
sauces
-LRB-
lol
-RRB-
and
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
plan
a
trip
to
Madison
based
on
the
soups
that
day
.
And
their
etouffe
labelled
``
too
hot
to
eat
''
actually
lives
up
to
its
name
while
still
retaining
seriously
good
flavor
is
another
rare
find
indeed.Oyster
Po'Boy
is
money
.
Their
bread
is
really
good
and
the
taste
is
unique.The
Jambalaya
is
better
than
I
've
had
in
New
Orleans
.
New
Orleans
Take
out
is
one
of
the
best
values
in
the
city
.
Ca
n't
say
enough
about
it.Good
food
for
a
good
price
...
I
finally
got
to
try
out
the
New
Orleans
Take
Out
Restaurant
and
was
fairly
impressed
.
The
wife
and
I
split
an
order
of
etoufee
and
black
beans
and
rice
.
It
was
plenty
of
food
.
Nothing
too
fancy
,
but
it
was
tasty
.
I
will
definitely
be
going
back
and
will
hopefully
try
out
a
poboy
and
some
of
their
other
dishes
.
.
For
the
people
saying
no
place
to
sit
.
Are
you
sure
you
are
rating
the
correct
location
?
They
had
plenty
of
tables
there
complete
with
copies
of
the
northside
news
paper
,
isthmus
and
the
onion.Went
here
for
the
first
time
last
night
.
Thought
i
'd
give
it
try
based
on
the
ratings
.
Im
originally
from
the
south
so
i
was
a
little
aprehensive
about
trying
it
,
but
thankfully
i
was
totally
suprised
!
Husband
had
the
red
beans
n
rice
with
smoked
sausage
,
i
had
the
shrimp
creole
and
we
got
a
half
order
of
wings
.
Everything
was
excellent
and
very
authentic
.
Although
i
will
warn
you
,
it
is
not
for
those
with
sensitive
mouths
!
Cajun
is
spicy
food
and
this
def
lived
up
to
that
!
Will
be
going
backSince
I
lived
in
Madison
-LRB-
about
8
years
ago
-RRB-
the
po
'
boys
at
NOTO
have
haunted
me
!
The
pursuit
of
a
po
'
boy
as
good
as
this
has
eluded
me
through
4
cities
and
countless
``
nope
,
not
as
good
``
s.
I
'm
such
a
fan
I
bought
a
tank
top
on
my
last
visit
!
Perfect
bread
,
perfect
seasonings
-
be
it
oyster
,
shrimp
,
crawfish
or
chicken
.
Whenever
I
'm
back
in
Madison
-LRB-
which
is
,
unfortunately
,
rarely
,
I
take
friends
to
get
a
``
sandwich
as
big
as
yo
head
''
and
they
never
leave
disappointed
.
As
I
remember
it
,
NOTO
is
that
kind
of
hole
in
the
wall
place
that
newcomers
hesitate
to
try
out
.
My
advice
-
do
it
!
As
much
as
I
love
these
sandwiches
I
hardly
ever
order
them
out
anymore
because
I
know
they
will
never
be
as
good
as
at
New
Orleans
Take
Out
in
Madison
,
WI.I
love
the
food
here
.
Love
the
vibe.Allow
me
to
express
my
undying
love
for
New
Orleans
Take-Out
.
I
lived
in
Madison
almost
8
years
ago
and
have
yet
to
find
another
shrimp
po
'
boy
even
remotely
close
to
the
delicacy
at
NOTO
.
It
's
one
of
those
hole
in
the
wall
places
that
looks
scary
and
not
hygienic
on
the
outside
but
is
completely
amazing
and
totally
worth
it
.
I
remember
the
first
time
my
dad
took
me
for
a
``
sandwich
as
big
as
yo
head
.
''
I
had
just
taken
the
ACT
as
a
6th
grader
and
afterwards
all
I
was
really
capable
of
was
mumbling
simple
sentences
.
I
remember
being
surprised
that
dad
was
n't
kidding
,
the
sandwich
really
was
as
big
as
my
head
.
And
that
it
was
like
,
really
awesome
.
My
fam
were
instantly
regulars
.
8
years
and
3
citites
later
,
the
search
continues
.
I
'm
not
even
asking
for
a
better
sandwich
-LRB-
I
do
n't
think
one
exists
-RRB-
,
but
one
that
's
just
as
good
-LRB-
it
seems
like
that
does
n't
exist
either
-RRB-
.
Oh
and
if
this
review
sounds
similar
to
the
one
by
Sheena
F.
it
's
because
she
's
my
sister
.
It
's
a
family
obsession.Good
shrimp
jambalaya
but
great
cornbread
in
a
developing
neighborhood
.
A
future
spot
on
Food
Network
's
Diners
,
Drive-ins
and
Dives
show.Been
to
New
Orleans
...
this
place
is
just
as
good
as
anything
there
.
Today
's
shrimp
in
cream
sauce
was
outstanding.Good
food
,
slightly
high
prices
.
I
had
the
crawfish
etouffee
,
my
standard
cajun
dish
.
It
was
quite
good
.
My
brother
had
red
beans
and
rice
with
sausage
,
which
he
loved
.
Our
friend
had
red
beans
and
rice
.
All
were
good
.
No
leftovers
,
but
we
were
full
.
The
fresh
lemonade
was
good
;
the
maple
bacon
pralin
was
meh.Not
the
friendliest
staff
,
but
this
place
is
one
of
the
true
gems
in
town
all
things-considered
.
Good
food
but
totally
overpriced.While
in
Madison
for
a
ski
trip
,
I
tapped
into
the
almighty
resource
that
is
Yelp
to
find
some
unique
eats
.
I
did
n't
want
to
eat
any
of
the
other
chain
garbage
that
all
the
other
tourists
were
eating
near
the
hotel
.
Enter
NOTO
.
What
an
awesome
little
find
!
After
reading
some
of
the
reviews
,
I
wanted
to
try
a
little
bit
of
everything
.
The
woman
at
the
counter
suggested
we
try
the
Mardi
Gras
Combo
and
the
popular
Shrimp
Po
'
Boy
sandwich
.
I
wanted
to
try
the
dirty
rice
and
was
told
that
I
could
substitute
the
regular
rice
in
the
Combo
for
dirty
rice
.
Yes
,
please
!
First
,
I
'd
like
to
clarify
that
the
sandwich
is
NOT
as
big
as
other
reviews
may
make
it
out
to
be
.
It
's
a
standard
French
roll
with
a
standard
amount
of
fillings
BUT
the
flavors
are
admittedly
some
of
the
best
I
've
ever
had
.
The
juxtaposition
of
creamy
,
tangy
sauce
with
the
crunchy
,
juicy
shrimp
combined
with
the
fresh
lettuce
will
have
you
swooning
for
more
.
On
to
the
combo
...
What
a
cornucopia
-LRB-
nods
to
Candice
G.
-RRB-
of
beautifully
tasty
french
creole
goodness
all
nestled
magically
in
compartmentalized
order
without
any
compartments
in
the
take-out
box
.
It
traveled
several
miles
successfully
in
the
manner
as
well
.
The
warnings
of
the
menu
and
lady
at
the
counter
on
the
spiciness
of
the
dirty
rice
and
shrimp
creole
were
accurate
.
It
was
a
flavorful
,
creeping
sort
of
spice
that
increased
with
each
bite
.
Absolutely
fantastic
.
The
name
``
take-out
''
is
rather
misleading
because
there
is
ample
seating
inside
the
place
and
many
interesting
jazz
memorabilia
to
peruse
over
while
eating
so
eat-in
instead
of
taking-out
as
the
name
suggests
.
I
'll
definitely
be
making
a
stop
here
again
whenever
I
'm
in
the
Madison
area
for
some
good
ol'
N'Orleans
style
cookin
'
.
I
've
always
meant
to
order
from
here
,
but
I
used
to
go
to
New
Orleans
so
often
that
it
's
never
been
pressing
issue
.
Finally
,
one
day
the
cravings
got
to
us
,
so
we
tried
the
place
out
.
The
place
was
exceptionally
easy
to
order
from
.
They
do
n't
play
1,000
questions
with
you
,
which
is
nice
.
The
menu
is
easy
to
find
online
if
you
do
n't
have
a
paper
copy
.
I
admit
,
when
I
picked
up
our
order
and
got
it
home
,
we
were
slightly
dismayed
at
the
quantity
.
We
ordered
two
dishes
for
three
people
.
We
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
the
Big
Easy
and
have
become
accustomed
to
ordering
from
the
locals
'
joints
which
cater
to
the
service
people
.
Large
portions
,
cheap
prices
.
Then
we
tasted
it
.
We
had
the
large
trio
-LRB-
combination
of
a
few
things
-RRB-
and
it
was
so
good
--
the
flavors
were
great
,
the
stuff
was
actually
spicy
,
and
I
found
I
could
love
jambalaya
-LRB-
normally
not
a
fan
-RRB-
.
We
also
go
a
shrimp
po
`
boy
--
I
was
so
excited
that
it
tasted
almost
exactly
at
the
one
we
get
from
our
normal
go-to
place
in
the
Quarter
.
While
the
quantity
was
less
than
we
expected
,
the
quality
was
superior
to
what
we
get
at
our
little
dive
joints
.
You
can
definitely
see
they
emphasize
flavor
and
texture
,
rather
than
giving
you
a
week
's
worth
of
food
.
That
works
for
me
--
we
were
all
full
off
our
dishes
and
very
happy.Overall
felt
like
the
food
lacked
flavor
.
The
jambalaya
and
gumbo
seemed
blah
to
both
of
us
.
The
BBQ
shrimp
and
cornbread
were
both
good.I
have
been
going
to
both
of
the
NOTO
places
for
many
years
now
,
I
would
have
gone
four
stars
but
there
are
some
quality
problems
at
the
eastside
shop
.
It
is
closest
to
our
house
so
we
would
like
to
go
there
but
over
the
years
we
have
gotten
a
few
inedible
poorly
prepared
dishes
from
the
east
side
establishment
and
when
it
is
good
it
still
seems
lower
quality
vegetables
and
such
,
less
fresh
like
the
food
has
been
in
a
steam
table
for
a
while
.
The
downtown
establishment
I
have
never
had
a
bad
dish
from
as
a
result
we
drive
across
the
isthmus
to
get
takeout
which
is
a
bit
of
a
schlep
so
we
order
from
them
less
often
then
we
might
otherwise.best
place
ever
and
good
gumbo
and
chicken
filetHubby
had
the
fish
with
pecans
,
and
LOVED
it
.
I
,
on
the
other
hand
had
an
absolutely
pitiful
shrimp
Po
Boy
.
Big
ole
piece
of
bread
,
8
shrimp
set
on
the
bread
to
try
to
cover
space
-LRB-
it
does
n't
-RRB-
,
smidge
of
lettuce
-LRB-
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
-RRB-
,
and
mushy
disgusting
tomatoes
.
Take
a
bite
,
and
all
you
taste
is
bread
.
Never
again.I
had
the
red
beans
and
white
rice
with
cornbread
,
dirty
rice
,
fries
.
Not
quite
what
my
granny
used
to
make
.
But
the
dirty
rice
was
spicy
and
I
added
it
to
the
bland
white
rice
and
beans
to
add
flavor
to
it
.
It
was
ok
buy
upset
my
stomach
.
Cornbread
was
dense
and
moist
?
Flavorless
though
.
I
wanted
some
warm
buttery
cornbread
goodness
.
Nope
.
The
fries
and
bbq
sauce
was
all
I
liked
in
my
order.I
love
this
place
!!!!
It
's
an
authentic
hole
in
the
wall
kind
if
place
with
the
best
Cajun
food
in
Wisconsin
.
I
have
been
to
New
Orleans
and
eating
here
takes
me
right
back
!
The
food
is
fresh
and
delicious
!
My
favorite
way
to
treat
myself
.
Highly
recommendI
just
love
this
place
.
Nothing
else
like
in
Madison!Can
I
give
zero
stars
?
I
did
n't
even
get
to
eat
.
As
soon
as
we
walked
in
the
cashier
looked
at
us
and
walked
in
the
back
and
never
came
back
out
.
The
cooks
were
outside
smoking
and
gossiping
about
the
night
before
's
drunk
.
This
was
at
6
pm
.
Prime
dinner
time
.
The
tables
were
all
dirty
.
The
visible
part
of
the
kitchen
was
messy
and
cross
contaminated
.
Overall
,
we
were
flagrantly
ignored
.
We
left
after
ten
minutes
of
non-service
.
I
was
very
sad
because
I
had
heard
such
good
reviews
and
the
menu
looked
good
,
but
the
facilities
were
sketchy.love
the
too
hot
to
eat
shrimp
etouffe
favorite
spicy
dish
in
madison
all
the
kinds
of
po
boys
ive
tried
have
been
very
good
could
have
better
beverage
selection
i
like
the
cornbreadSo
much
on
the
menu
,
I
wish
I
could
have
tried
more
.
I
made
the
decision
to
go
with
a
half
order
and
should
have
gone
with
the
full
.
The
beans
are
amazing
-
I
ran
into
a
some
great
flavors
.
The
rice
is
just
right
not
mushy
not
hard
.
The
french
bread
is
yum
,
though
I
personally
could
use
heaps
of
butter
on
it
.
Good
mercy
this
red
beans
and
rice
with
sausage
is
good
.
I
wish
I
had
found
this
place
sooner
.
Prices
are
reasonable
too
.

*
's
because
it
's
my
first
time
there
and
``
Yay
!
I
'm
a
fan
.
''
Hope
to
make
it
5
after
the
next
visit.A
Madison
institution
for
all
the
right
reasons
.
The
soups
are
just
perfect
.
Creole
cheeseburger
is
one
you
should
try
.
The
Po
boys
are
my
favorite
.
The
rice
and
beans
are
overpriced
.
John
is
the
original
owner
and
totally
legit
.
Place
looks
like
a
Louisiana
dive
,
but
is
clean
.
Counter
service
only
.
Fast.Decent
menu
selections
,
better
than
average
service
for
a
restaurant
outside
of
downtown
,
and
a
fair
price
.
It
is
hardly
authentic
,
but
we
dine
with
our
six
year
old
often
and
Pedro
's
is
a
great
place
for
kids
or
to
go
after
work
to
watch
the
game
.
They
have
changed
the
salsa
twice
and
it
still
sucks
.
I
was
informed
by
the
manager
that
the
old
recipe
was
`
too
spicy
'
for
people
in
this
overgrown
Mayberry
.
Over
all
it
is
decent
with
pretty
good
service
.
4
stars
are
for
value
and
service.There
really
should
be
some
kind
of
board
that
gives
accrediation
to
restaurants
claiming
to
be
``
Mexican
.
''
That
way
the
consumer
would
know
that
places
like
Taco
Bell
,
Pedro
's
and
ChiChi
's
-LRB-
if
they
're
even
still
open
-RRB-
are
not
really
Mexican
restaurants
,
even
though
they
purport
to
be
.
That
way
folks
would
n't
be
fooled
into
eating
at
a
``
Mexican
Restaurante
''
just
because
there
's
an
``
e
''
at
the
end
of
``
Restaurant
.
''
After
my
meal
at
Pedro
's
,
I
decided
to
just
hit
up
Taco
Bell
the
next
time
I
'm
in
Madison
and
I
want
``
Mexican
.
''
It
's
just
as
crappy
as
this
place
,
but
far
easier
on
the
pocketbook
.
This
place
is
an
afront
to
the
people
of
Mexico
and
their
cuisine.By
all
common
sense
i
should
detest
this
place
,
over-salted
food
...
check
,
stereotypical
music
...
yup
...
includes
ranch
in
food
...
oh
yes
.
-LRB-
and
then
there
are
the
monstrous
portion
sizes
-RRB-
I
keep
coming
back
because
they
have
1/2
priced
margaritas
on
Thursdays
,
a
fairly
decent
happy
hour
,
fresh
tortillas
,
fresh
ingredients
,
and
decent
service
.
The
food
plays
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
so
my
friends
who
hate
all
things
not-American
food
can
find
something
they
enjoy
.
If
you
want
authentic
Mexican
go
to
S.
Park
Street
and
hit
up
El
Pastor
.
-LRB-
for
serious
-RRB-
Also
If
you
have
to
choose
between
the
east
side
Pedro
's
or
the
west
side
location
.
.
hands
down
pick
the
west
.
-LRB-
east
is
a
tad
dumpy
-RRB-
All
I
ever
get
here
are
the
chicken
fajitas
and
those
are
fairly
hard
to
screw
up
.
Anything
else
I
've
tired
here
has
been
sub-par
.
Really
,
the
best
thing
about
this
place
is
the
freshly-made
tortillas.First
of
all
,
they
charged
us
to
split
an
entree
.
In
fact
,
we
had
to
do
the
splitting
-
I
guess
they
charge
to
have
access
to
an
extra
plate
.
The
mushrooms
in
our
enchilada
were
canned
,
and
then
burned
.
The
ranchero
sauce
tasted
like
the
red
sauce
that
comes
with
Spaghetti-O
's
.
The
chips
and
salsa
was
less
spectacular
than
the
stuff
I
buy
on
sale
at
the
grocery
store
.
The
part
I
depend
on
most
to
get
me
through
crappy
Mexican
food
-
margaritas
-
also
disappointed
.
They
tasted
like
Kool-Aid
-LRB-
but
without
adequate
water
-RRB-
and
lacked
tequila
.
This
was
all
at
the
west
side
location
,
and
I
hear
the
east
side
is
even
worse
.
No
vuelvo.Not
even
the
hungriest
,
rabid
infested
pack
of
Chihuahuas
would
touch
this
food
.
All
their
food
is
canned
process
nonsense
.
It
's
like
Mc
Donalds
on
Mescaline
.
Now
the
freshly
made
tortillas
are
good
,
but
that
's
it.I
'm
not
going
to
lie
to
you
,
this
food
is
nowhere
near
Mexican
,
but
the
enchilada
suiza
is
delicious
in
it
's
own
right
-LRB-
ignore
the
side
dishes
,
blech
!
-RRB-
.
The
margaritas
are
delicious
,
and
if
you
go
on
half-price
Thursdays
,
very
reasonable
.
They
have
a
good
price
on
their
lunch
menu
.
I
would
n't
say
I
recommend
it
necessarily
if
you
are
looking
for
authentic
Mexican
...
buuut
,
eh
,
it
's
tasty
once
in
a
while.o.k
.
it
is
Pedros
,
but
the
baked
Friday
night
fish
is
the
best
I
had
in
Madison
.
Great
texture
,
spices
,
the
rye
bread
,
chipotle
sauce
and
coleslaw
were
great
too
.
Of
course
the
freshly
baked
tortillas
were
fattening
and
awesome
.
The
atmoshpere
is
a
little
off
,
but
a
great
surpise
for
Friday
fish.Does
anyone
in
Madison
consider
this
a
great
Mexican
food
location
?
Both
of
my
experiences
at
Pedro
's
have
left
me
disheartened
.
They
go
a
little
something
like
this
:

Thursday
night

Friends
invite
me
for
inexpensive
margaritas
.
Am

by
a
girl
who
wants
me
to
go
out
with
her
father
standing
10
feet
away
,
who
ironically
is
the
least
creepy
of
the
crowd
looking
to
enjoy
cheap
tequila
.

Being
a
girl
from
the
southwest
,
I
have
had
a
great
fajita
or
two
in
my
day
.
If
you
are
feeling
rebellious
and
decide
to
go
despite
the
many
poor
reviews
,
know
this
:
Mexican
food
is
great
,
and
this
is
nowhere
near
that.Let
me
just
get
this
out
of
the
way
.
I
grew
up
in
Madison
and
for
years
this
was
my
favorite
Mexican
place
.
I
thought
it
was
the
best
possible
place
...
anywhere
.
Then
I
moved
to
Phoenix
and
had
real
Mexican
food
and
now
...
I
wanted
to
review
this
place
because
it
's
not
as
bad
as
some
of
the
other
reviewers
are
making
it
sound
.
Their
salsa
and
chips
are
fresh
and
some
of
the
best
around
.
They
serve
you
fresh
warm
tortillas
with
your
meal
that
go
well
with
anything
.
Some
of
the
pre-meal
quesadillas
are
fantastic
.
My
favorite
dish
here
is
the
Bean
Burrito
with
red
sauce
.
The
way
the
beans
and
cheese
are
melted
together
just
makes
it
so
craveable
.
Still
,
a
lot
of
this
food
is
simply
not
authentic
,
and
more
than
a
few
are
on
the
heavy
side
.
You
will
walk
away
feeling
full
and
likely
be
on
the
toilet
for
a
little
while
the
next
day
.
There
is
no
way
around
this
.
The
simple
truth
is
that
there
is
no
superb
mexican
food
here
in
Madison
,
and
Pedro
's
fits
right
in
to
this
muddy
amalgam
of
mediocrity
.
Some
things
it
does
well
though
,
and
the
cheap
drinks
on
a
Thursday
night
usually
make
for
a
good
atmosphere.Not
bad
.
They
had
a
great
Valentine
's
Day
special
that
we
went
here
for
,
and
the
service
was
prompt
and
we
got
our
food
quickly
.
Our
waiter
was
friendly
-LRB-
they
have
been
whenever
I
've
gone
-RRB-
and
the
food
was
pretty
tasty
.
All
in
all
,
not
much
to
separate
Pedro
's
from
the
other
Mexican
restaurants
in
the
area
,
and
it
certainly
is
n't
the
best
out
there
,
but
decent
in
price
,
quality
and
service
for
sure
-LRB-
the
Seafood
Suiza
is
the
best
there
,
in
my
honest
opinion
,
but
all
other
foods
are
just
ok
-RRB-
.
I
went
here
last
night
slummin
'
.
Uh
huh
,
that
's
right
,
I
said
it
.
This
is
not
the
go
to
place
for
authentic
Mexican
food
,
by
now
most
people
know
this
.
It
's
what
many
would
call
``
Americanized
.
''
I
had
the
enchiladas
suiza
.
One
with
cheese
,
one
with
spinach
.
The
flavors
appealed
to
the
``
fat
American
who
likes
cheese
''
in
me
.
The
freezer
burned
spinach
with
crunchy
leaf
stems
was
not
so
pleasing
however
.
I
was
n't
overly
offended
by
anything
,
because
I
went
in
here
knowing
it
would
be
mediocre
Americanized
Mexican
food
complete
with
kitschy
decor
.
Bonuses
of
the
night
included
well
,
not
much
,
but
hey
,
the
waitress
was
hot.I
like
this
place
...
When
you
go
there
you
know
what
you
are
going
to
get
;
warm
cheesy
comfort
food
,
that
is
definitely
not
mexican
.
But
if
you
go
there
knowing
what
to
expect
,
you
wo
n't
be
disappointed
.
Check
their
name
of
the
day
,
you
get
a
free
meal
!
And
its
fun
to
go
for
half
price
margs
on
Tuesdays
and
Thursday
,
which
usually
coincides
with
karaoke
or
the
fueling
pianos
.
I
like
what
one
reviewer
said
though
,
def
do
n't
dress
up
of
you
are
going
to
drink
here
...
You
will
get
hit
on
by
creepers
and
townies.The
item
you
pick
for
your
dinner
can
quite
literally
make
or
break
the
experience
here
.
That
is
,
your
cheesy
,
Americanized
Mexican
food
experience
.
I
tried
the
vegetarian
tamale
and
it
was
nothing
less
than
awful
.
No
cheese
anywhere
,
no
flavor
,
just
HOT
.
Ok
yes
,
the
menu
indicates
this
a
``
spicy
''
dish
,
but
it
did
n't
indicate
its
high
degree
of
suck
.
Unfortunately
on
this
particular
visit
we
did
n't
get
a
hot
waitress
.
Instead
we
got
a
disenchanted
guy
who
apparently
did
n't
want
a
very
big
tip
.
His
heavy
sighs
,
eye
rolls
,
and
general
lack
of
even
being
around
99
%
of
the
time
led
me
to
believe
he
was
channeling
his
inner
emo
and
could
n't
be
bothered
.
We
were
sat
next
to
a
group
of
teenage
girls
,
which
by
automatic
default
says
``
we
hate
you
and
want
you
to
die
.
''
They
talked
very
loudly
about
their
sexual
escapades
and
did
that
annoying
screech
laughing
.
I
get
it
,
I
was
a
teenager
once
too
,
but
if
I
could
go
back
in
time
I
'd
kick
my
own
teenaged
ass
.
The
food
,
service
,
and
ambiance
was
like
the
time
I
fell
off
my
motorcycle
and
got
really
bad
road
rash
.
I
hope
I
wo
n't
be
doing
that
again
any
time
soon.Pedros
is
a
staple
in
the
community
.
A
great
place
where
you
can
bring
family
and
friends
to
have
a
really
good
time
.
The
food
is
all
made
fresh
,
which
is
great
.
For
the
price
and
the
selection
,
you
really
ca
n't
beat
it
.
One
other
thing
to
mention
...
Have
had
a
group
event
at
Pedro
's
-
and
also
a
couple
events
catered
.
The
catering
menu
is
great
-
and
they
make
it
really
easy.You
can
not
compare
Pedro
's
to
the
other
big
Mexican
food
presence
,
Laredo
's
.
Pedro
's
has
home
made
tortillas
,
Laredo
's
does
not
.
Pedro
's
gives
you
a
much
bigger
bowl
of
salsa
that
Laredo
's
.
I
never
have
to
look
around
for
a
refill
.
But
the
salsa
tastes
vary
different
between
the
two
restaurants
.
The
Mexican
rice
at
Pedro
's
is
very
tomatoey
-LRB-
?
-RRB-
Service
at
Pedro
's
is
not
as
good
as
Laredo
's
.
Overall
,
Pedro
's
deserves
a
look.This
West
location
is
now
CLOSED
.
Owner
would
like
to
reopen
in
the
future.Opinions
are
a
changing
.
Went
to
Pedros
over
the
weekend
.
Tamales
were
not
good
.
The
sauce
had
formed
a
skin
on
the
top
because
it
sat
under
the
heat
lamps
too
long
.
I
took
three
bites
before
I
found
any
pork
.
I
ate
half
of
one
and
the
waiter
asked
if
I
wanted
to
take
the
rest
home
.
When
I
said
no
,
my
satisfaction
was
not
questioned
.
I
'll
stick
with
Laredos.If
I
could
give
no
stars
,
I
would
have
.
Coming
from
Texas
,
this
place
is
a
disappointment
.
It
just
sucks
.
They
have
real
Mexican
's
working
for
them
,
yet
they
ca
n't
even
make
an
even
tortilla
.
They
are
always
puffy
,
misshapen
,
to
thick
etc.
.
Most
of
the
food
comes
out
cold
and
does
n't
even
make
sense
.
Disgusting!The
west
side
location
was
way
better
.
After
they
shut
down
I
started
going
to
this
one
.
The
food
is
n't
as
good
and
the
fresh
made
tortillas
are
always
either
hard
,
cold
,
or
burnt
.
Half
the
time
I
'm
there
they
screw
up
my
order
.
One
time
there
was
a
miscommunication
between
the
waitress
and
my
boyfriend
which
ended
up
costing
us
$
7
.
It
would
n't
have
been
that
big
of
a
deal
if
the
manager
at
first
told
the
waitress
to
tell
us
she
was
n't
there
and
when
she
did
finally
come
out
she
did
n't
apologize
,
make
any
effort
into
making
the
situation
any
better
,
and
then
started
repeating
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
so
we
'd
shut
up
.
A
couple
of
my
friends
and
I
have
decided
to
never
go
back
here
.
Hopefully
the
west
side
one
will
open
up
again.The
fajitas
were
awesome
and
the
tortillas
were
fresh
from
the
tortilla-machine
which
was
kinda
fascinating
.
Delicious
corn
cakes
.
The
fish
tacos
however
were
shitty
,
the
fish
was
fishy
,
dry
and
not
enough
of
it
,
Maciek
had
a
dry
tortilla
,
which
is
weird
since
they
were
all
fresh
and
everything
.
All
in
all
it
was
pretty
good
and
the
service
was
great
,
they
stayed
open
way
past
closing
time
for
us.Stopped
at
this
place
on
a
ride
from
Minnesota
to
Chicago
,
on
my
way
back
to
california
--
the
beacon
of
good
mexican
food
in
the
US
...
so
I
was
excited
to
see
what
this
place
had
to
offer
!
Very
friendly
staff
and
reasonable
prices
on
generous
portions
.
We
were
started
off
with
the
customary
chips
and
salsa
,
which
was
quite
tasty
,
and
then
a
fun
treat
--
warm
fluffy
tortillas
which
we
could
put
butter
or
sugar
on
.
These
were
amazing
...
I
liked
this
change
.
I
was
getting
full
by
this
point
and
the
entree
had
n't
even
been
served
.
We
also
got
some
guac
which
was
made
in
a
cool
manner
with
some
great
ingredients
table
side
.
Delicious
.
When
my
vegetarian
tamales
finally
came
,
I
was
already
pretty
full
and
managed
to
eat
half
of
one
and
a
yummy
corn
cake
.
The
tamale
was
a
little
spicy
for
my
taste
,
but
not
bad
.
The
margarita
was
n't
the
most
amazing
,
but
also
not
bad
.
A
good
little
experience
passing
thru
Madison.Danger
Will
Robinson
!
Avoid
this
place
.
Stale
chips
,
Pace
Picante
salsa
,
microwaved
food
.
I
ordered
a
chimi
and
the
middle
was
still
frozen
.
Server
was
really
slow
and
did
not
seem
to
know
the
menu
.
The
dining
area
is
extremely
shabby
:
ripped
cushions
and
dingy
tables
.
I
do
not
know
why
I
stayed
after
the
first
five
minutes.DO
NOT
EAT
HERE
!
The
food
is
microwaved
and
tastes
like
it
came
out
of
a
box
.
Yes
,
they
have
homemade
tortillas
,
but
the
stomach
ailment
you
suffer
from
after
visiting
here
is
totally
not
worth
it
.
Even
the
drinks
are
watered
down
and
the
place
is
full
of
viejitos
.
Instead
,
take
a
short
drive
to
Cuco
's
on
Buckeye
Rd
off
of
Stoughton
and
ask
for

This
place
has
the
potential
to
be
an
adult
chuck
e.
cheese
for
happy-hour-nacho-and-beer-aficionados
...
however
,
thats
not
the
experience
I
had
.
I
sat
down
and
immediately
wondered
what
was
in
store
.
What
followed
-LRB-
a
bland
burrito
-RRB-
was
both
surprising
-LRB-
not
in
a
good
way
-RRB-
and
disappointing
-LRB-
for
the
obvious
blandness
-RRB-
.
In
short
,
the
food
left
much
to
be
desired
.
I
did
enjoy
the
kitschy
ambiance
but
it
did
not
make
up
for
subpar
food
.
Venture
into
this
establishment
at
your
own
risk.I
love
this
place
!
Was
sooooo
sad
when
I
found
out
the
Wisc
Dells
location
closed
.
So
,
detoured
into
Madison
on
the
ride
home
and
still
got
my
fix
of
yummie
fresh
hot
chips
and
salsa
with
a
tasty
strawberry
marg
.
Onto
my
fav
dish
,
the
Enchiladas
seafood
suiza
,
yum
.
My
fav
mexican
place
to
date.Pedro
's
really
only
deserves
two
stars
,
but
more
on
that
later
.
Do
n't
come
to
Pedro
's
in
search
of
authentic
Mexican
food
.
But
there
are
some
things
on
the
menu
that
are
perfectly
fine
should
you
find
yourself
here
for
some
reason
,
at
a
loss
as
to
what
to
order
.
I
would
suggest
avoiding
most
of
the
menu
,
which
is
essentially
Tex-Mex
T.V.
dinner-type
fare
,
except
with
molten
cheese-drowned
portions
that
could
feed
a
T-Rex
.
I
would
suggest
,
instead
,
the
carnitas
fajitas
:
the
pork
is
very
tender
and
flavorful
,
and
the
sauteed
vegetables
are
tasty
.
Not
authentic
--
but
perfectly
fine
.
They
do
have
a
good
Tuesday/Thursday
margarita
special
,
though
the
drinks
are
too
sweet
for
my
taste
.
I
met
my
S.O.
at
Pedro
's
:
hence
the
extra
star
.
It
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
,
and
I
'll
keep
coming
back
most
Tuesdays
for
trivia
night.Warning
:
DO
NOT
WASTE
YOUR
MONEY
ON
THIS
PLACE
!
Terrible
service
!
I
've
had
multiple
items
on
the
menu
,
and
they
've
all
been
below
average
.
BTW
,
if
you
're
looking
to
have
a
burrito
with
the
usual
items
-LRB-
meat
,
lettuce
,
tomato
,
rice
,
beans
,
etc
-RRB-
be
prepared
to
have
1
menu
option
-LRB-
The
3
lb
burrito
-RRB-
that
runs
you
13-15
dollars
,
and
MORE
if
you
want
grilled
steak
-LRB-
of
which
they
will
give
you
5-7
SMALL
pieces
-RRB-
.
Margaritas
are
OK
,
but
be
prepared
to
wait.Absolute
worst
Mexican
food
I
have
ever
eaten
,
period
.
It
's
like
Mexican
food
for
people
who
do
n't
like
Mexican
food
.
Much
of
the
food
had
little
taste
to
it
.
I
would
rather
eat
Taco
Bell
,
and
I
do
n't
like
Taco
Bell.Pedro
's
was
some
of
the
better
that
I
have
tasted
in
Madison
.
Being
from
AZ
,
Mexican
food
which
is
``
amazing
''
is
hard
to
find
.
Their
salsa
had
a
good
flavor
.
One
thing
which
was
great
is
their
tortillas
,
fresh
made
and
if
dipped
in
the
con
queso
sauce
they
are
even
better
!
The
service
was
not
amazing
,
drinks
were
empty
a
lot
.
Overall
Pedro
's
is
eatable
,
if
you
want
authentic
Mexican
then
this
is
not
the
place
for
you.I
have
to
give
Pedro
's
a
``
good
news
,
bad
news
''
review
.
I
tried
the
Camarones
wrap
-
big
mistake
.
The
shrimp
were
barely
warm
and
slimy
.
The
rest
of
the
filling
in
the
wrap
was
also
unappetizing
;
shredded
lettuce
and
maybe
some
tomatoes
in
a
disgusting
creamy
sauce
.
After
2
bites
I
had
to
give
up
,
I
could
n't
choke
down
any
more
.
I
give
the
waiter
credit
though
.
When
I
complained
he
offered
to
bring
me
something
else
or
take
if
off
the
bill
with
no
argument
.
My
party
ordered
the
``
table
''
Guacamole
,
a
2
avocado
version
mixed
to
your
preference
at
the
table
.
That
was
very
good
.
So
try
the
table
guac
,
but
give
the
shrimp
wrap
a
pass
.
The
waiter
was
also
truly
nice
.
So
like
I
say
,
good
news
,
bad
news.Pedro
's
is
a
place
that
I
remember
fondly
from
my
childhood
.
We
used
to
eat
there
from
time-to-time
when
I
was
a
kid
.
Sadly
,
the
place
has
n't
seemed
to
evolve
much
since
the
80
's
.
We
went
for
an
early
dinner
one
night
before
seeing
a
show
in
Madison
.
We
were
seated
at
about
4:30
pm
,
and
were
the
only
ones
in
the
dining
room
.
The
decor
is
80
's
``
americanized
Mexico
.
''
It
looked
exactly
as
I
remember
it
from
years
ago
.
It
did
seemed
to
be
kept
up
.
I
was
really
looking
forward
to
the
hot
fresh
tortillas
they
used
to
serve
.
There
is
a
tortilla
maker
in
the
middle
of
the
dining
room
.
Unfortunately
,
the
machine
was
n't
running
.
I
can
understand
that
since
the
place
was
pretty
empty
,
but
the
tortillas
they
gave
us
were
dry
and
hard
.
They
had
been
sitting
out
for
awhile
.
That
was
a
bit
disappointing
.
I
had
a
burrito
,
it
was
ok
.
Nothing
too
exciting
.
In
the
80
's
and
90
's
it
would
have
been
great
,
but
Mexican
food
in
Wisconsin
has
gotten
so
much
better
over
the
years
.
I
still
love
their
chips
and
salsa
,
though
!
However
,
that
probably
is
n't
enough
to
bring
me
back
again
anytime
soon.Badger
game
disappointment
!
Watered
down
drinks
,
slow
service
and
rude
management
!
My
husband
and
I
have
watched
many
badger
games
at
Pedro
's
.
Good
drink
specials
and
multiple
TVs
have
made
this
our
go
to
spot
for
years
.
The
service
is
always
slow
and
the
food
is
just
decent
but
it
's
a
good
spot
to
watch
a
game
...
Tonight
was
a
completely
different
story
!
My
Guinness
tasted
just
like
water
,
I
suspect
it
was
watered
down
.
Our
service
was
super
slow
.
We
were
there
for
over
30
minutes
before
we
received
chips
and
salsa
.
The
chips
were
hot
but
they
needed
salt
.
Their
salsa
tasted
like
ketchup
.
Once
we
ordered
,
again
our
food
took
forever
.
My
cousin
asked
for
sour
cream
and
waited
another
20
minutes
for
it
.
My
food
was
ok
.
The
tamale
was
actually
pretty
good
.
It
needed
spice
though
.
The
kicker
was
when
the
manager
,
Brett
,
started
changing
the
channels
shortly
after
halftime
!
We
asked
the
waitress
what
was
going
on
.
We
came
for
a
badger
game
.
Our
menus
had
badger
specials
,
FB
also
listed
their
badger
specials
.
Having
just
received
our
food
...
Yes
it
took
two
quarters
,
we
could
n't
relocate
to
another
establishment
.
Apparently
,
there
was
a
UFC
fight
on
.
We
asked
to
speak
to
management
,
this
is
when
we
met
Brett
.
We
asked
about
the
game
.
He
refused
to
turn
the
game
back
on
stating
that
they
paid
$
2000.00
for
the
UFC
fight
and
they
were
going
to
show
it
.
I
looked
around
at
the
sea
of
red
and
asked
him
what
his
current
demographic
/
customer
base
thought
of
missing
the
second
half
of
the
game
.
He
again
referenced
the
cost
.
His
solution
was
to
have
us
move
tables
in
the
middle
of
our
dinner
to
be
in
view
of
a
smaller
tv
with
no
sound
!
Worst
of
all
was
when
I
told
him
we
would
n't
be
returning
because
of
this
he
said
,
``
Ok
.
''
He
clearly
does
n't
care
about
his
customers
!
Awful!The
only
thing
good
about
this
place
is
Tuesday
and
Thursday
is
half
price
Margaritas
...
That
and
they
have
a
chip
,
salsa
,
cheese
and
bean
buffet
with
that.The
food
was
really
really
good
.
Fast
and
courteous
service
.
The
prices
and
menu
selection
was
very
reasonable
.
I
plan
on
returning
for
future
visits.Food
is
ok
.
Fajitas
were
pretty
good
.
Enchiladas
left
much
to
be
desired
.
Service
is
ok
,
kind
of
slow
especially
if
you
have
8
or
more
people
.
Table
is
served
the
standard
chips
and
salsa
.
Also
served
fresh
tortillas
and
butter
which
I
have
never
seen
anywhere
else
and
were
very
good.I
love
hosting
large
groups
here
!
They
are
so
accommodating
,
will
do
separate
checks
and
provide
excellent
customer
service
.
I
've
had
at
least
5
events
with
parties
of
20
+
people
-LRB-
sometimes
even
last
minute
-RRB-
and
they
do
n't
bat
an
eye
.
The
food
is
pretty
good
and
they
have
a
very
large
bar
selection
.
The
tortillas
are
fresh
and
my
favorite
dish
is
the
shrimp
fajitas.Pedros
is
a
decent
chain
for
Mexican
Resturants
,
however
it
comes
no
where
near
the
good
authentic
stuff
you
can
have
down
south
!
Starting
off
with
the
chips
and
salsa
is
always
so
good
,
but
so
filling
,
by
the
time
my
food
comes
,
its
all
I
can
do
to
eat
more
!
The
tortillas
are
also
to
die
for
,
a
little
butter
and
they
are
heaven
!
Chick
Enchiladas
Suiza
are
the
only
way
to
go
!
I
always
have
a
side
of
corn
cakes
as
they
are
delicious!Service
at
the
bar
was
good
,
food
not
so
good
.
My
fault
for
ordering
mashed
potatoes
at
a
Mexican
restaurant
.
Entree
size
very
small
for
the
price.great
fresh

and
chip

for

even
better

love
the
seafood
burrito
with
shrimp
good
enchildas
probarly
not
true
authentic
mexician
but
my
family
has
always
liked
it
good
place
for
large
groups
service
is
solid
we
come
as
much
as
any
sitdown
resturant
in
townWent
with
a
friend
who
remembered
it
being
good
from
years
ago
.
The
service
was
barely
adequate
.
I
ordered
the
$
10
Asado
burrito
.
I
kid
you
not
there
was
8-10
small
peices
of
cut
up
steak
.
That
was
it
.
The
rest
of
the
burrito
was
onion
.
It
was
so
bad
I
actually
got
sick
and
threw
it
up
when
I
got
home
.
I
ca
n't
believe
the
ridiculous
prices
for
a
small
amount
of
food
.
I
could
have
made
that
entire
meal
for
less
than
$
3
at
home
.
I
'll
never
go
back
.
And
I
'll
make
sure
to
let
all
my
friends
know
not
to
bother
going
at
all
.

Had
dinner
at
Pedro
's
on
a
recent
weeknight
.
I
had
never
been
before
but
have
always
noticed
that
the
place
looks
a
little
dumpy/weathered
from
the
outside
.
Sometimes
restaurants
that
do
n't
look
like
much
from
the
outside
can
end
up
being
amazing
so
we
decided
to
give
it
a
try
.
The
inside
of
the
restaurant
is
also
older
looking
and
probably
in
need
of
a
refresh
.
However
,
the
place
is
gigantic
and
it
was
nice
to
be
seated
right
away
.
The
service
was
quick
and
we
were
bought
a
basket
of
chips
and
salsa
-LRB-
gluten
free
!
-RRB-
and
a
basket
of
warm
flour
tortillas
-LRB-
sadly
not
gluten
free
-RRB-
.
I
had
a
mango
margarita
-LRB-
Pedro
's
has
lots
of
options
for
their
house
margs
-RRB-
which
was
great
.
They
have
a
gluten
free
menu
within
their
standard
menu
and
as
with
most
Mexican
restaurants
there
are
lots
of
g
free
options
.
I
had
tacos
in
corn
tortillas
with
veggies
and
rice
on
the
side
.
The
food
was
just
ok
,
not
awful
but
not
stellar
either
.
The
veggies
and
rice
were
luke
warm
which
was
disappointing
.
My
boyfriend
had
the
fajitas
which
he
said
were
``
just
ok
''
as
well
.
I
would
n't
mind
stopping
in
again
if
I
am
in
the
east
side
of
town
but
would
n't
go
out
of
my
way
to
come
here.I
last
visited

,
and
it
was
10:45

,

I
'm
uncertain
what
type

use
in

I

it

this
was
a
great
option
for
our
group
,
and
I
could
n't
have
been
any
happier
than
I
was
with
the
service
.
It
was
really
,
really
outstanding
.
I
'd
return
for
drinks
and
appetizers
again.Pedros
serves
up
everything
you
would
want
from
an
Americanized
,
cheesey
Mexican
restaraunt
.
They
have
some
over
the
top
mariachi
music
playing
in
the
dining
room
,
fake
parrot
cages
hanging
from
the
ceiling
,
free
chips
and

,
solid
service
,
gigantic
burritos
smothered
in
cheese
and
a
ginormous
variety
of
margaritas
.
While
I
wo
n't
venture
to
say
this
represents
anything
close
to
legitimate
Mexican
cuisine
,
it
is
exactly
what
the
doctor
ordered
for
like
95
%
of
Madisonians
.
My
favorite
things
about
this
place
:
-
Fresh
tortillas
,
pressed
and
warmed
in

-
Flavored
Margarita
variety
,
because

be

something
to
be
applauded

Pro
tip
:
Do
n't
order
off
the
menu
for
your
kids
,
a
buttered
tortilla
with
crushed
up
chips
and
a
little
salsa
is
probalby
the
best
thing
they
have
,
and
its
not
even
on
the
menu
.
Pretty
awesome
,
do
n't
knock
it
til
you
try
it.Bad
service
.
Waiter
was
rude
and
obnoxious
.
We
never
got
refills
on
drinks
or
salsa
.
The
menus
were
sticky
.
Fajitas
came
out
w
literally
one
tablespoon
of
cheese
.
.
we
live
in
Wisconsin
!
!!
The
chimichangas
were
on
point
though.Holy
hell
,
what
happened
to
this
place
??
This
had
been
my
go-to
place
for
beans-and-rice
Mexican
in
Madison
for
the
better
part
of
two
decades
,
and
I
had
converted
my
wife
into
a
Pedro
's
fan
.
I
'd
had
past
or
present
Madison
residents
take
issue
with
my
insistence
that
Pedro
's
was
a
great
casual
dinner
place
,
but
I
took
that
as
part
and
parcel
of
Madison
's
legendary
pretentiousness
toward
anything
that
's
not
``
edgy
,
''
such
as
old-school
Americanized
Mexican
food
.
Unfortunately
,
it
turns
out
any
snobbery
against
Pedro
's
may
be
justified
.
My
wife
and
I
stopped
in
for
the
first
time
in
3
or
4
years
and
we
were
both
sorely
disappointed
with
our
experience
.
The
burrito
is
smaller
than
it
used
to
be
--
I
suppose
that
's
how
they
've
been
able
to
hold
the
line
on
prices
so
the
size
reduction
is
probably
justified
--
but
my
wife
's
fajitas
were
chewy
,
and
both
dishes
lacked
that
``
kick
''
that
they
used
to
have
.
Our
quesadilla
appetizer
arrived
luke-warm
and
was
nearly
rock-hard
within
minutes
.
The
premises
have
n't
changed
in
the
nearly
20
years
I
've
been
eating
there
and
it
's
starting
to
show
its
age
.
Service
was
adequate
,
no
more
no
less
.
which
would
be
fine
if
everything
else
up
to
par
.
In
short
,
Pedro
's
lacks
that
extra
spark
that
used
to
make
it
worth
a
special
stop
when
visiting
or
passing
through
town
.
Not
to
mention
the
Mexican
cuisine
options
have
exploded
in
Madison
in
the
last
20
years
,
so
one
would
think
Pedro
's
would
need
to
step
up
their
game
rather
than
rest
on
their
laurels
.
Looks
like
we
'll
be
checking
out
the
newer
competitors
on
our
next
visit
to
Madison.Standard
family
diner
.
Nothing
surprising
here
.
A
decent
place
to
stop
for
breakfast.Oh
.
My
.
God
.
One
would
think
that
any
restaurant
in
America
's
Dairyland
,
especially
a
chain
restaurant
that
has
been
around
for
decades
,
could
serve
breakfast
without
screwing
it
up
.
Our
family
of
three
ordered
breakfast
for
dinner
tonight
and
this
Perkins
disappointed
the
heck
out
of
us
.
One
order
was
steak
and
eggs
:
the
steak
was
supposed
to
be
medium
and
the
eggs
over
hard
.
What
came
to
the
table
was
a
bloody
,
raw
steak
--
not
rare
,
mind
you
,
but
raw
--
and
eggs
with
a
translucent
,
inedible
crust
around
the
outer
edge
.
Some
of
that
crust
ended
up
in
one
of
the
other
orders
,
which
was
scrambled
eggs
with
biscuits
and
gravy
.
One
does
not
expect
the
possibility
of
breaking
a
tooth
when
eating
scrambled
eggs
,
but
not
one
,
not
two
,
but
three
two-inch
long
pieces
of
that
translucent
crust
ended
up
in
the
folded
,
dry
``
scrambled
eggs
.
''
Another
order
of
scrambled
eggs
--
mine
--
had
a
long
,
thin
,
hair-like
thread
of
indeterminate
origin
.
Was
it
the
same
substance
as
the
translucent
crust
?
Was
it
a
string
from
a
hairnet
?
Was
it
a
human
hair
?
When
I
pulled
it
from
my
mouth
,
it
split
in
two
and
curled
up
like
elastic
might
curl
up
.
Our
server
was
appropriately
apologetic
and
tried
to
make
things
okay
--
the
service
was
good
,
but
the
food
was
absolutely
horrid
!
The
manager
asked
us
how
our
dinner
was
when
we
went
to
pay
,
so
we
told
her
.
She
took
20
%
off
of
our
bill
but
,
truly
,
the
food
we
ate
was
overpriced
at
any
discount
.
If
we
all
had
n't
been
so
darn
hungry
and
tired
,
we
'd
have
left
without
eating
.
And
if
I
had
it
to
do
over
,
I
would
have
insisted
we
all
leave
after
finding
the
inedible
translucent
hard
gluey
stuff
in
the
eggs
and
find
somewhere
else
to
go
.
Do
NOT
repeat
our
mistake
.
AVOID
this
restaurant
.
Try
the
IHOP
down
the
road
if
you
want
breakfast
.
Go
across
the
interstate
to
Texas
Roadhouse
if
you
want
a
steak
.
Go
hungry
if
you
must
,
just
do
n't
eat
here
.
Please.Was
staying
at
the
comfort
inn
next
to
Perkins
and
the
clerk
told
me
they
gave
10
%
off
for
guests
.
I
figure
I
'd
get
a
late
night
burger
and
I
was
n't
disappointed
.
I
called
and
ordered
.
It
was
coming
off
the
grill
in
the
time
it
took
me
to
walk
over
.
Burger
was
good
and
staff
was
friendly.My
wife
introduced
me
to
Perkins
just
this
year
and
every
time
we
've
driven
through
Wisconsin
,
we
've
stopped
at
a
Perkins
.
This
was
the
3rd
Perkins
that
I
've
been
to
and
have
enjoyed
the
food
and
service
every
time
.
We
both
ordered
pancakes
with
a
side
of
bacon
.
The
food
was
very
good
and
the
service
was
even
better
.
My
wife
commented
that
either
Perkins
manages
to
hire
the
friendliest
people
or
they
have
excellent
training.This
is
so
below
average
.
The
restaurant
decor
is
out
dated
and
worn
out
.
Poor
service
below
average
breakfast
and
how
do
you
even
screw
up
breakfast
.
Manager
asked
how
was
everything
I
said
``
just
ok
``
he
said
ok
did
not
inquire
.
Food
did
not
have
quality
flavor
it
was
very
bland.Pretty
good
breakfast
.
Good
service
-
I
did
n't
wait
at
all
to
be
seated
or
to
receive
my
food
.
I
really
like
the
food
came
exactly
as
I
ordered
it.Well
,
The
pie
is
good
.
The
coffee
is
good
.
The
restroom
was
gross
.
But
they
did
have
lots
of
parking
.
My
breakfast
was
75
%
correct
.
As
the
Yelp
2
Star
rating
says
:
Meh
.
I
've
experienced
better.Not
so
good
.
Eggs
were
overcooked
,
I
could
not
chew
the
whites
,
and
the
hash
browns
were
burned
on
the
outside
and
raw
inside
.
Come
here
for
desserts
only
,
not
breakfast
.
The
service
was
excellent
and
friendly
and
the
restaurant
was
clean
.
Prices
were
quite
high
,
three
eggs
and
hash
browns
was
$
14.00
with
coffee.Note
:
This
review
is
location-sensitive
.
I
called
the
wrong
location
-LRB-
Sun
Prairie
-RRB-
when
I
needed
delivery
to
east
Madison
.
To
THEIR
credit
,
the
girl
there
was
incredibly
nice
and
gave
me
the
new
number
of
the
east
side
location
.
Rude
employee
,
Bad
food
,
Bad
service
.
Will
never
order
from
them
again
.
However
,
when
I
called
the
Commercial
Street
location
,
a
gentleman
answered
,
with
incredibly
loud
music
in
the
background
causing
me
to
barely
understand
the
questions
I
expected
.
He
asked
for
the
necessary
delivery
info
and
what
I
wanted
.
I
asked
him
which
would
be
easier
for
him
,
the
numbers
or
titles
of
what
I
wanted
-LRB-
given
that
I
looked
online
prior
to
calling
-RRB-
and
he
replied
with
`
whatever
,
no
both
'
.
I
started
my
order
and
he
corrected
me
rudely
telling
me
I
was
n't
referring
to
the
correct
numbers
,
that
they
belonged
to
another
store
-LRB-
there
's
only
one
website
-RRB-
.
After
taking
my
order
,
he
took
my
card
number
,
said
it
would
be
45
minutes
,
and
hung
up
.
The
delivery
man
was
very
cordial
,
however
,
the
food
was
the
worst
Chinese
I
've
ever
had
-LRB-
Order
:
Crab
Rangoon
,
Chicken
Fried
Rice
,
Pork
Egg
Roll
,
General
Tso
's
Chicken
-RRB-
-
the
chicken
and
rice
was
dry
,
the
general
tso
's
was
mostly
fried
dough
,
the
crab
rangoon
had
overpowering
green
onions
and
the
fortune
cookie
stale
.
I
would
n't
recommend
this
place
to
anyone.Was
not
feeling
well
yesterday
so
I
ordered
some
food
online
for
delivery
from
Chang
Jiang
.
Originally
I
though
I
had
enough
cash
to
pay
for
the
order
but
realized
as
I
was
finishing
my
online
order
I
'd
have
to
pay
by
credit
card
.
I
took
the
$
23
and
threw
on
the
table
next
to
the
door
so
I
could
tip
in
cash
.
When
the
guy
delivered
,
BTW
he
was
in
my
neighbors
driveway
about
2
feet
into
his
lawn
,
I
grabbed
what
I
though
was
a
$
3
tip
.
Woke
up
this
morning
and
realized
that
I
had
given
him
$
23
instead
of
3
.
I
forgot
to
remove
the
$
20
bill
when
I
handed
him
the
cash
.
I
did
n't
look
at
it
,
like
I
said
,
I
was
sick
.
I
called
this
morning
to
and
began
the
conversation
with
him
like
this
''
Hi
,
you
delivered
food
to
me
yesterday
on
____
St.
and
I
think
I
may
have
mistakenly
given
you
too
much
for
the
tip
.
He
started
yelling
in
to
the
phone
that
I
gave
him
a
$
3
tip
not
a
$
23
dollar
tip
.
He
was
ranting
and
raving
.
The
weird
part
is
that
I
had
not
even
said
the
amount
I
though
I
had
mistakingly
tipped
him
.
I
was
talking
calmly
and
he
was
ranting
that
I
also
had
stolen
his
pen
from
him
-LRB-
a
20
cent
pen
!
-RRB-
Why
would
someone
react
like
that
to
a
simple
inquiry
??
I
was
not
accusatory
,
I
was
simply
inquiring
.
And
then
for
him
to
say
he
wanted
to
come
over
and
pick
up
the
pen
I
had
taken
from
him
?
WTF
?
Ever
heard
of
Karma
dude?Solid
option
.
I
live
on
the
east
side
and
delivery
is
limited
.
Chang
Jiang
is
not
the
greatest
place
out
there
,
but
it
is
decent
.
They
have
online
ordering
or
over
the
phone
.
They
deliver
in
blizzards
and
on
Sundays
.
They
also
regularly
send
out
coupons
.
They
have
a
huge
menu
!
Their
appetizers
are
lacking
,
there
are
only
about
8
options
which
include
the
usual
crab
rangoon
,
egg
rolls
and
soup
.
I
generally
order
their
orange
chicken
or
their
General
Tsao
's
chicken
.
All
of
their
meals
come
with
fried
rice
-LRB-
unless
otherwise
noted
-RRB-
or
you
can
substitute
.
I
love
my
food
VERY
spicy
and
they
always
amp
it
up
when
I
request
that
.
They
make
it
exactly
how
I
like
it
.
Overall
flavors
are
decent
.
They
sauce
can
sometimes
be
overpowering
to
the
point
where
you
can
not
tell
the
different
between
veggies
and
meat
in
your
container
.
The
portions
are
inconsistent
.
They
had
switched
containers
for
awhile
and
portions
got
smaller
.
Then
all
of
a
sudden
we
are
back
to
big
containers
!
It
is
not
a
big
deal
,
I
still
got
a
ton
of
food
.
Basically
this
is
a
typical/standard
Chinese
food
place.Wow
,
this
place
is
so
hit
or
miss
.
I
'm
honestly
just
not
sure
what
I
'll
be
getting
for
delivery
each
time
I
order
-LRB-
the
same
thing
-RRB-
.
They
must
have
a
different
person
cooking
the
stuff
every
single
time
because
nothing
ever
comes
to
me
the
same
as
the
last
.
I
have
had
some
great
General
Tso
's
here
,
and
I
have
had
some
horrible
way
too
spicy
un
eatable
Tso
's
here
.
It
's
just
so
confusing
.
I
enjoy
the
lunch
special
the
best
.
Most
lunch
specials
are
around
$
4.99
and
come
with
fried
rice
-LRB-
or
white/just
ask
-RRB-
and
a
egg
roll
.
Great
!
It
's
enough
food
for
a
second
meal
for
most
.
Who
can
beat
that
?
Pretty
much
anything
and
everything
is
offered
under
this
lunch
special
as
well
.
What
a
deal
!
Great
egg
rolls
,
Very
good
Rangoon
!
Awesome
soups
!
Yet
...
like
I
said
,
you
ca
n't
expect
the
same
dish
every
time
.
It
's
a
surprise
to
what
quality
of
food
will
end
up
in
front
of
you
.
Pretty
quick
delivery
-LRB-
usually
around
25-30
minutes
-RRB-
.
Good
sesame
chicken
,
orange
chicken
,
beef
and
broccoli.First
off
-
as
an
11-year
Madison
resident
,
I
ate
at
Cracker
Barrel
for
the
very
first
time
-LRB-
here
-RRB-
last
weekend
.
We
met
friends
from
out
of
town
,
and
overall
it
was
pretty
good
.
The
staff
had
no
problem
pulling
together
two
tables
for
the
7
of
us
,
and
service
was
both
prompt
and
correct
.
CB
serves
breakfast
all
day
,
and
what
a
breakfast
it
is
!
Portions
were
fair
,
not
huge
,
and
the
price
was
right
.
Bacon
,
eggs
,
biscuits
and
grits
-
yum
.
My
only
gripe
was
that
the
sausage
gravy
was
gelatinous
and
plopped
out
of
the
bowl
instead
of
pouring
.
That
was
kind
of
gross
.
CB
clearly
caters
to
insterstate
travelers
,
and
it
does
this
well
.
You
can
also
find
some
interesting
items
in
their
huge
``
country
store
''
,
from
cutesy
mugs
and
figurines
to
sweatshirts
for
Gramps
and
Easter
dresses
for
the
young
`
uns.Food
is
good
,
can
be
bland
at
times
,
but
still
pretty
good
.
Service
is
top
notch
and
will
try
to
seat
big
groups
as
fast
as
they
can
.
This
place
fills
up
fast
on
weekend
for
breakfast
so
come
early.I
've
been
to
cracker
barrel
twice
.
The
food
was
ok
,
I
agree
with
Thomas
that
the
food
can
be
bland
.
Warning-if
its
busy
do
n't
expect
to
be
able
to
carry
on
a
conversation
very
easily
.
Can
be
really
loudIt
had
been
quite
a
while
since
we
ate
at
a
Cracker
Barrel
.
We
stopped
there
when
shopping
at
East
Towne
Mall
.
I
ordered
the
pot
roast
and
my
husband
ordered
chicken
and
dumplilngs
.
Yuck
!
It
had
more
salt
than
you
'd
find
in
food
at
McDonalds
.
The
meat
in
the
pot
roast
tasted
processed
.
The
dumplings
were
slimy
.
The
vegetables
were
so
salty
,
they
were
inedible
.
Pros
:
The
shop
is
very
cute
.
Cons
:
Do
n't
eat
the
food.I
am
sorry
to
hear
about
the
bad
food
some
people
had
here
because
we
have
never
had
a
bad
meal
here
.
-LRB-
update
,
just
had
a
bad
meal
here
.
The
shrimp
dinner
.
one
of
the
worst
I
have
ever
had
.
They
do
fish
so
well
but
their
shrimp
was
over
breaded
popcorn
shrimp
that
did
not
have
that
country
specialness
that
you
expect
from
CB
.
The
hushpuppies
were
also
dry
and
flavorless
.
-RRB-
I
have
had
very
good
trout
and
also
a
very
well
done
steak
.
It
fits
into
a
narrow
country
recipe
selection
but
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
that
you
ca
n't
beat
the
price
and
the
quality
of
food
.
Service
has
always
been
good
,
the
environment
is
pleasant
and
there
is
plenty
of
room
.
The
bathrooms
are
very
clean
.
The
gift
shop
has
something
for
everyone
.
We
almost
always
find
something
and
they
do
n't
particularly
cater
to
out
taste
.
In
the
midst
of
country
craft
,
bible
baubles
and
kitchen
kitch
-LRB-
is
there
such
a
thing
?
-RRB-
we
have
found
some
nice
decorative
items
,
ornaments
,
candy
,
and
other
gifts
.
Found
a
hair
in
an
egg
and
they
immediately
remade
the
entire
meal
and
the
manager
came
out
to
speak
with
us
.
Good
and
appropriate
recovery
.
My
pancakes
this
time
around
were
not
as
flavorful
as
the
last
.
They
were
still
good
.
On
a
cold
winter
day
get
a
seat
near
the
fireplace
and
have
a
nice
home
cooked
meal
.
The
coffee
has
always
been
good
too
.
It
is
n't
fancy
stuff
but
still
good
.
Folks
here
are
almost
always
very
pleasant
and
talkative
.
Update
:
The
French
Toast
was
nothing
special
.
Third
meal
I
have
had
here
that
I
did
n't
care
for
much
.
Avoid
it
.
Ham
was
so-so
as
was
the
smoked
sausage
.
Not
a
good
breakfast
for
me
.
Coffee
was
n't
good
this
time
either
.
Staff
continues
to
be
great
.
I
would
suggest
the
management
review
all
their
dishes
and
step
them
up
a
notch
.
The
meals
are
underpriced
.
Maybe
this
is
leading
to
less
quality
dishes
.
Stop
this
.
Raise
the
prices
and
improve
the
quality.I
am
writing
this
review
as
a
big
advocate
of
Cracker
Barrel
in
general
.
Every
city
I
travel
,
I
know
I
wont
be
disappointed
.
Not
to
sound
like
a
broken
record
,
but
my
favorite
is
the
Grandpas
breakfast
with
hash
brown
casserole
.
I
decided
to
get
the
apple
dumpling
dessert
here
and
to
my
big
surprise
,
they
do
not
peel
the
apples
here
in
the
apple
dumpling
.
Call
it
picky
,
but
other
two
previous
Cracker
Barrels
that
I
have
gone
to
,
they
peel
the
apples
.
It
tastes
much
better
and
when
i
told
the
waitress
that
,
she
simply
shrugged
it
off
.
When
my
friend
also
complained
that
his
berry
dessert
was
only
half
of
what
it
should
be
-LRB-
completely
deflated
and
only
half
the
bowl
-RRB-
,
she
did
n't
offer
to
take
it
back
or
anything
,
just
kind
of
laughed
it
off
.
Most
likely
,
we
probably
would
n't
have
sent
our
food
back
simply
because
I
use
to
work
in
the
food
industry
,
but
I
know
its
just
simple
etiquette
to
at
least
offer
.
Nevertheless
,
I
will
still
continue
to
go
to
Cracker
Barrels
no
matter
what
.
Good
food
at
a
GREAT
price.I
nicknamed
my
``
lunch
special
''
the
``
recession
plate
,
''
as
my
portion
was
significantly
smaller
than
my
table
mates
.
The
food
was
okay
,
just
kind
of
fatty
.
The
corn
muffins
had
so
much
butter
it
was
nauseating
-
and
i
love
butter
.
The
only
thing
that
saved
this
place
was
the
chocolate
bar
i
purchased
in
the
store
area
.
That
shit
was
good.I
really
like
CB
for
a
good
breakfast
meal
.
I
still
think
the
Original
Pancake
House
trumps
them
...
They
are
in
a
league
of
their
own
but
the
CB
does
provide
good
quality
and
breakfast
for
a
excellent
price
.
You
can
feed
a
family
of
5
and
everyone
be
full
for
a
great
price
.
Being
someone
who
does
n't
eat
pork
and
this
being
a
breakfast
country
restaurant
,
I
am
very
pleased
that
they
have
turkey
products
like
bacon
and
sausage
.
The
menu
is
very
large
as
they
have
two
,
one
for
breakfast
and
the
other
for
lunch/dinner
.
Service
has
always
been
good
when
I
've
dined
there
and
the
staff
has
good
knowledge
of
the
menu
.
I
reserve
4
and
5
stars
for
upscale
and
gourmet
restaurants
but
is
give
the
CB
a
solid
3
stars.Delicious
food
-LRB-
their
burgers
are
seriously
the
best
fast-food
burgers
-RRB-
!
The
service
here
is
fine
,
the
prices
are
a
bit
high
,
and
this
location
is
nice
and
quiet
.
All-in-all
,
an
okay
place
,
especially
considering
it
's
fast
food.Hardee
's
in
Madison
is
kind
of
a
tradition
for
my
family
whenever
we
drive
through
town
.
We
do
not
have
a
Hardee
's
where
we
live
so
it
is
kind
of
a
treat
for
us
.
Simply
put
,
the
food
is
better
than
Mc
Donalds
and
the
deals
are
comparable
.
The
service
is
not
quite
as
quick
but
your
food
is
fresher
when
you
get
it.It
's
pretty
good
,
but
it
is
expensive
.
Think
Culver
's
prices.Really
great
value
!
Best
fast
food
burgers
in
town
,
better
than
culvers
.
Went
on
a
Thursday
and
thick
burger
combo
was
$
6
bucks
with
tax
!
Burger
was
big
tasty
and
messy
.
Fries
we
're
hot
and
seasoned
nicely
.
If
your
thinking
red
robin
burger
without
the
sit
down
price
tag
,
come
here
and
you
'll
be
pleasantly
surprised
:
-RRB-
I
stopped
here
on
the
way
to
my
hometown
from
the
airport
one
of
the
last
times
I
was
in
the
Madison
area
.
I
'm
normally
a
huge
fan
of
the
Wisconsin
Swiss
Melt
,
but
the
one
I
had
here
was
not
so
good
.
First
,
the
sandwich
was
exceptionally
greasy
.
I
do
n't
think
I
've
ever
had
a
patty
melt-type
sandwich
that
was
that
greasy
in
my
life
.
Yeah
,
I
understand
this
is
a
joint
that
specializes
in
butter
burgers
,
but
this
was
extreme
,
even
for
Culver
's
.
Second
,
the
size
of
the
burger
was
pathetic
.
Admittedly
,
I
've
been
out
of
Wisconsin
for
a
few
years
now
,
so
maybe
my
recollection
of
the
size
of
Culver
's
burgers
is
n't
so
good
,
but
the
patty
on
this
particular
sandwich
was
seriously
thin
,
and
the
burger
came
no
where
close
to
covering
the
bread
.
If
you
're
just
passing
through
the
north
side
of
Madison
and
have
a
sudden
craving
for
Culver
's
,
I
'd
suggest
you
keep
going
and
stop
at
the
location
in
Waunakee
or
the
location
near
East
Towne
Mall
,
depending
upon
which
direction
you
're
heading.This
Culvers
gives
Culvers
a
bad
name
.
Ive
had
excessively
slow
service
,
hair
in
my
ice
cream
and
burgers
that
resemble
dog
food
and
that
's
enough
for
me
.
Ive
never
quite
seen
a
burger
paddy
so
thin
and
greasy
before
in
my
life
.
You
've
got
to
be
desperate
to
eat
there.The
bastard
child
of
two
sexy
Culvers.Grade
:
C
Chain
food
.
Okay
service
.
I
ca
n't
explain
why
I
do
n't
hate
this
place.For
a
chain
this
place
is
great
...
The
chips
and
salsa
is
AOK
The
Bean
burger
is
better
than
a
lot
of
other
places
.
and
the
desserts
are
good
too
-LRB-
the
blondie
brownie
-RRB-
the
servers
are
kinda
rude
and
uninformed
though.Our
waiter
was
very
friendly
,
he
had
a
southern
accent
.
I
could
not
tell
if
he
was
a
high
school
kid
or
college
kid
but
he
was
very
friendly
and
provided
great
service
.
I
had
the
lunch
special
-
half
soup
and
half
salad
.
For
soup
I
had
the
chili
-
it
was
way
too
soupy
.
Come
on
,
pack
the
protein
,
more
beans
and
more
meat
please
!
The
cobb
salad
was
not
bad
.
The
avocado
dressing
that
came
with
it
was
delicious
.
And
$
7
for
that
?
Oh
yeah.Good
food
.
Great
service
.
Ask
for
Waitress
Aimee
~
she
was
friendly
and
professional.Stopped
for
an
early
dinner
with
my
wife
,
she
wanted
to
try
the
two
for
twenty
special
.
As
soon
as
we
told
the
server
what
we
wanted
the
service
went
downhill
.
We
did
not
order
any
alcohol
and
we
were
having
the
special
so
this
was
not
going
to
be
a
big
check
for
the
server
but
restaruant
was
not
busy
so
any
check
should
be
better
than
no
check
.
Used
the
kiosk
to
pay
for
meal
since
i
could
n't
get
the
server
to
come
back
to
check
on
us.Discount
did
not
show
up
on
kiosk
I
shouls
have
been
more
aware
since
i
had
heard
a
similar
comment
from
another
table
when
we
came
in
.
Server
said
not
to
worry
that
the
amount
was
correct
.
I
pushed
for
reciept
showing
what
was
actually
being
charged
to
ny
card
.
server
said
she
needed
my
card
and
would
have
to
talk
to
the
manager
.
Finally
got
my
paper
reciept
with
correct
charges
but
kiosk
on
table
showed
the
over
charge
and
had
not
adjusted
.
My
wife
thought
we
were
going
to
be
billed
twice
for
the
same
meal
,
so
she
has
been
watching
the
debit
card
account
.
This
incident
killed
my
night
and
the
weekend
with
my
wife
constantly
checking
the
bank
account
.
This
incident
is
all
that
my
has
been
talking
about
to
her
friends
all
weekend
long
,
I
am
sure
that
this
will
continue
once
she
gets
to
work
tomorrow.Ordered
a
cup
of
the
chili
and
the
steak
fajitas
.
The
quality
was
consistent
with
other
Chili
's
I
've
eaten
at
in
the
past
.
Nothing
spectacular
but
then
nothing
terrible
either
.
The
atmosphere
is
typical
of
the
chain
,
and
kept
clean
enough
.
The
only
downside
was
the
waiter
.
He
messed
up
the
drink
order
by
bringing
a
Corona
instead
of
the
Blue
Moon
and
included
the
up
sell
beans
and
rice
,
which
I
had
told
him
I
did
n't
want
at
time
of
order
.
Both
mistakes
seemed
to
be
intended
to
get
the
ticket
price
up
to
increase
his
tip.It
's
a
national
chain
so
you
pretty
much
get
what
you
'd
expect
.
I
have
never
had
problems
with
the
service
and
the
food
is
always
good.Had
the
Santa
Fe
salad
.
Man
,
was
it
good!I
do
a
lot
of
shopping
at
Copps
because
1
-RRB-
it
's
close
and
2
-RRB-
I
usually
frequent
Copps
as
a
change
of
pace
from
the
smaller
markets
and
co-ops
.
As
far
as
large
chain
grocery
stores
go
,
Copps
has
a
wide
selection
in
pretty
much
every
food
category
,
including
a
coffee
stand
,
bakery
,
butcher
,
salad
bar
,
and
deli
-LRB-
whose
workers
are
the
most
surly
you
've
probably
ever
encountered
-RRB-
.
There
's
a
selection
of
organic
foods
that
is
decent
for
a
chain
grocery
,
a
good
cheese
aisle
,
and
a
well-stocked
liquor
section
.
Copps
has
weekly
sales
from
time
to
time
,
often
on
its
own
line
of
products
,
but
prices
in
general
tend
to
be
middle
of
the
road
or
higher
for
your
usual
goods
.
Be
sure
to
get
a
Copps
card
-LRB-
its
free
-RRB-
to
take
advantage
of
the
sales
.
If
you
have
a
chance
,
I
've
noticed
the
Copps
on
University
on
the
westside
is
*
much
*
more
posh
and
has
a
better
selection
and
display
of
its
items
,
particularly
the
service
counters
-LRB-
deli
,
bakery
,
etc.
-RRB-
.
Having
visited
this
Shopko
location
after
encountering
the
westside
Copps
made
things
look
a
little
bit
drearier
...
THANK
GOD
!
I
am
sick
of
co-ops
.
One
shop
for
everything
food
.
I
like
plastic
bags
and
large
carbon
footprints
.
I
'm
not
going
to
martyr
myself
and
pay
more
for
a
smaller
selection
for
some
pinko
environmentalist
agenda.It
's
a
Copps
.
They
generally
have
higher
prices
than
I
'd
like
,
and
I
find
their
image-signs
in
the
frozen
food
completely
counter-intuitive
,
but
it
's
clean
,
the
food
is
decently
fresh
,
and
if
we
're
in
the
area
we
'll
stop
in
for
a
thing
or
two
,
but
we
wo
n't
go
out
of
our
way
to
go
here
.
We
'd
much
rather
go
to
HyVee
.
The
service
is
so-so
.
No
one
outstandingly
friendly
,
and
no
one
outstandingly
rude.We
have
been
shopping
at
this
location
since
we
moved
into
the
neighborhood
this
past
year
.
Copp
's
-LRB-
the
past
year
or
two
-RRB-
has
really
gone
down
hill
.
We
normally
do
our
big
shopping
at
Woodman
's
because
it
's
cheaper
.
We
'd
go
to
this
Copp
's
more
but
1
,
the
prices
are
higher
MUCH
higher
than
almost
any
place
in
Madison
.
Also
they
have
a
horrible
time
having
things
in
stock
.
A
lot
of
shelves
are
barely
stocked
-LRB-
during
the
week
even
-RRB-
and
the
signs
in
the
frozen
area
are
dumb
,
having
lame
pictures
is
n't
helping
me
find
products
.
If
they
updated
a
few
things
,
had
more
things
in
stock
and
even
regular
items
in
stock
I
'd
give
a
better
rating
.
Also
the
parking
lot
is
pretty
dim/dark
.
Makes
me
feel
unsafe.Again
...
not
a
fan
of
Copps
,
in
general
.
This
one
seems
a
bit
older
and
a
bit
more
in
need
of
a
facelift
,
but
it
's
not
bad
.
Wide
aisles
,
plenty
of
check
outs
,
and
decent
produce
.
Prices
are
typically
higher
than
Woodman
's
,
but
Copps
allows
the
use
of
credit
cards
-LRB-
or
using
your
debit
card
as
a
credit
card
,
which
I
do
because
my
bank
gives
me
5
%
cashback
when
I
do
-RRB-
.
Bakery
items
are
usually
stellar
-
especially
the
chocolate
donuts
.
;
-
-RRB-
Cozy
place
with
good
fried
food
and
super
cheap
booze
.
I
expected
some
attitude
from
the
locals
when
stopping
in
here
before
a
party
nearby
and
got
none
--
partly
because
we
were
the
only
folks
there
but
also
the
bartender
was
nice
as
could
be
.
Perhaps
some
day
I
'll
go
back
and
point
out
the
inconsistent
apostrophe
position
in
their
signage
and
get
punched
in
the
face.A
friendly
locals
'
dive
bar
.
Do
n't
expect
much
,
however
,
it
's
a
nice
enough
place
if
you
need
to
whet
your
whistle
out
yonder.Due
to
the
third
annual
Schizophrenia
hardcore/gabber
event
,
my
friend
Aaron
and
I
found
ourselves
on
the
outskirts
of
Madison
and
in
need
of
whiskey
.
Luckily
the
warehouse
we
were
destined
for
was
by
Slices

are

and
the

is
awesome
.
I
lived
in
this

for
26
years

did
n't
know
this

existed

Come
in
and
ask
for

he
'll
treat
you
right

He
makes
a

sausage
sandwich
is
a

paired
with

.
The
sound

is
nice
and
the

is
deep

that
matters
to
you.The
bar
is
now
called
Slice

Justin

works

Kimmy

you

There
mixology
is
beyond

Great

even
better

Very

Yummy
teriyaki
and
big
portions
.
One
of
the
few
places
to
get
nearly-fresh
`
fast
'
food.Once
,
when
I
was
a
kid
,
I
was
reading
a
book
at
recess
because
I
was
a
big
nerd
and
that
's
how
I
rolled
.
This
kid
in
my
school
,
his
name
was
Weston
,
came
up
behind
me
and
,
without
warning
,
kicked
me
in
the
crotch
as
hard
as
he
could
.
It
was
the
kind
of
kick
where
I
did
n't
see
it
coming
.
His
foot
caught
me
right
in
the
jewel-box
and
lifted
me
a
good
six
inches
off
the
ground
.
I
felt
everything
go
weak
in
my
body
.
I
crumpled
to
the
ground
clutching
my
boys
and
screaming
.
I
cried
like
a
little
baby
.
You
would
have
,
too
.
Weston
ran
off
--
I
did
n't
find
out
he
was
the
one
who
did
it
until
days
later
.
When
the
playground
teacher
walked
over
to
find
out
what
was
wrong
with
me
,
I
could
n't
even
talk
to
tell
her
what
had
happened
.
I
thew
up
from
the
pain
.
When
I
could
finally
function
again
,
I
discovered
my
book
had
scattered
a
few
feet
out
in
front
of
me
and
landed
in
a
puddle
.
It
was
ruined
.
And
I
had
brought
that
book
from
home
.
For
weeks
,
nay
MONTHS
,
after
that
,
the
other
boys
in
my
class
thought
it
was
so
funny
that
I
got
nut-rocked
like
I
did
,
that
they
spent
most
of
their
free
moments
trying
to
find
ways
to
replicate
it
.
When
I
walked
through
the
halls
,
I
had
to
constantly
look
over
my
shoulder
,
lest
I
find
a
foot
planted
in
my
nards
.
When
I
was
at
recess
,
I
had
to
stand
with
my
back
to
the
wall
at
all
times
,
lest
someone
attempt
to
crotch-punt
me
across
the
playground
again
.
It
was
miserable
.
I
had
started
out
first
grade
loving
school
.
After
that
day
,
I
never
once
liked
school
again
.
Sarku
Japan
's
chicken
teriyaki
is
so
good
,
that
when
I
eat
it
,
for
a
few
blessed
seconds
,
I
forget
the
trauma
of
that
event.Grade
:
C
-
I
hate
Applebee
's
.
It
only
tasted
good
because
I
'm
on
a
diet.The
epitome
of
a
crap
chain
.
Why
did
I
get
talked
into
going
here
?
Because
I
am
a
tool
.
Crowded
,
loud
,
mediocre
food
,
slow
service
,
and
on
this
particular
occasion
a
strange
man
two
tables
down
and
across
the
aisle
staring
at
me
and
not
his
dining
companion
,
during
the
entire
meal
.
I
should
have
just
yelled
,
``
watch
my
head
spin
''
and
vomited
there
at
the
table.It
's
an
Applebee
's
...
what
do
you
expect
?
Every
Applebee
's
I
've
ever
been
to
has
sticky
tables
...
must
be
something
in
how
they
are
made
or
cleaned
.
The
shot
glass
desserts
are
n't
bad
,
but
if
you
go
here
,
you
know
what
you
are
getting
in
to.My
folks
love
this
place
and
I
ca
n't
imagine
why
.
I
had
the
chicken
wrap
and
it
could
not
hold
a
candle
to
the
wraps
at
the
Great
Dane
.
The
fries
are
so
overly
seasoned
they
are
almost
impossible
to
eat
without
a
huge
glass
of
water
.
Do
n't
go
there.This
needs
no
explanation.Service
has
always
been
excellent
.
usually
i
go
there
just
by
myself
but
sever
always
pays
a
lot
of
attention
to
me
.
I
am
not
a
big
fan
of
their
steaks
-
i
think
they
are
not
tender
enough
and
a
bit
chewy
.
but
the
rest
of
the
menu
is
amazing
!
try
parmesan
shrimp
or
their
pasta
bowls
.
2
for
20
$
including
an
appetizer
-
who
does
n't
love
that
?
thei
garlic
mashd
potatoes
loaded
with
sour
cream
are
very
good
too.Always
good
service
,
never
much
of
a
wait
.
Other
than
that
,
it
's
Applebee
's
...
you
should
already
know
what
to
expect.Service
was
great
and
quick
.
Our
drinks
arrived
quick
and
our
server
Melissa
had
honest
and
accurate
suggestions
.
She
was
really
friendly
and
fun
!
Only
problem
was
that
it
was
really
cold
because
of
the
air
conditioning
.
Otherwise
it
was
a
great
experience!The
service
was
great
,
I
love
my
server!TERRIBLE
!!!!!!
I
have
been
in
the
state
for
4
months
and
this
is
the
WORST
restaurant
choice
we
have
made
so
far
.
I
had
a
bad
feeling
and
should
have
listened
to
my
instinct
.
Wasted
$
40
.
Let
me
start
by
saying
the
host/hostess
were
the
nicest
staff
at
the
place
.
My
husband
ordered
the
7
oz
sirloin
with
riblets
,
seasonal
vegatables
and
mashed
potatoes
.
The
sirloin
was
mostly
fat
and
rubbery
.
There
was
no
meat
to
be
eaten
.
It
was
just
a
hunk
of
fat
.
The
riblets
even
had
a
weird
smoke
flavor
that
he
compared
to
cigarette
smoke
.
We
do
not
go
places
looking
for
an
all
smiles
server
,
but
this
guy
did
not
smile
and
when
he
saw
we
were
not
enjoying
our
meal
and
my
husband
's
plate
was
still
full
,
he
did
not
even
ask
if
the
food
was
okay
or
if
there
was
something
he
could
do
.
We
do
n't
like
to
complain
and
just
were
not
in
the
mood
to
even
let
him
or
the
manager
know
.
I
really
did
not
expect
the
food
to
be
so
bad
.
I
will
stick
to
TGIFridays
,
Texas
Roadhouse
and
Outback
Steakhouse
from
now
on
;
they
never
disappoint
and
we
have
no
problem
putting
down
$
50
or
$
60
plus
a
$
10
+
tip
.
For
the
same
$
40
spent
,
we
could
have
gotten
a
meal
we
actually
enjoyed
.
The
only
good
part
was
my
daughter
's
chicken
fingers
,
fries
and
pepsi
.
Sad
.
We
will
not
be
returning
.
For
such
a
nice
``
looking
''
exterior
,
you
would
think
they
'd
have
more
quality
food
and
servers
.
I
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.
.
sadly
.
Do
not
go
here
!
We
will
be
voiding
it
like
the
plague.Food
was
good
.
.
A
little
disappointed
in
my
Berry
Sangria
.
.
Wish
it
looked
and
tasted
as
good
as
the
picture
.
Nothing
stood
out
to
me
tho
.
I
might
go
back
for
their
cheese
sticks
tho
:
-RRB-
Last
time
I
went
I
was
very
disappointed
in
the
service
.
We
had
a
large
group
so
I
can
understand
it
taking
a
little
longer
than
normal
but
our
server
took
forever
to
ask
us
what
we
wanted
to
drink
-LRB-
we
were
a
little
later
than
the
rest
of
the
party
who
already
had
a
drink
-RRB-
.
Also
all
the
TVs
were
on
a
preface
channel
while
there
was
another
game
that
was
actually
on
.
I
do
n't
think
I
'd
ever
pick
to
go
there
again
.
Will
only
go
if
someone
else
wants
to.We
like
it
here
.
The
two
of
us
went
in
today
for
lunch
and
there
was
a
short
wait
-LRB-
15
minutes
-RRB-
so
we
decided
to
grab
our
drinks
at
the
bar
while
we
waited
.
The
Bartender
was
visually
a
bit
flustered
as
there
were
three
unsavory
looking
and
sounding
women
seemingly
trying
his
patience
with
their
drinks
and
menu
ordering
.
When
her
got
to
use
I
ordered
a
Cadillac
Margarita
on
the
Rocks
in
the
Big
glass
and
he
got
a
tall
Spotted
Cow
on
tap
.
I
continued
to
be
friendly
to
the
Bartender
as
I
know
the
type
and
he
was
tipped
$
3
for
the
drinks
.
While
we
got
down
off
our
bar
stools
he
did
say
`
thank
you
,
enjoy
your
meals
.
'
Our
waitress
was
Tasha
and
she
was
very
pleasant
;
we
ordered
the
mozzarella
sticks
as
an
appetizer
and
chatted
in
between
watching
basketball
and
Men
's
gymnastics
on
one
of
their
many
TV
's
.
I
ordered
the
bacon
cheeseburger
with
the
works
-LRB-
hold
the
cheese
-RRB-
and
he
ordered
two
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
trios
;
one
for
now
and
one
for
later
.
The
food
was
good
,
but
the
fries
were
sparse
and
non-crispy
while
they
were
seasoned
OK
.
He
had
another
Spotted
Cow
and
we
cashed
out
.
All
in
all
another
nice
afternoon
at
Applebee
's
.
Let
me
preface
this
by
saying
that
I
'm
usually
a
Burger
King
guy
-LRB-
I
like
their
mascot
better
,
McDonald
's
is
too
funny
looking
-RRB-
.
However
,
my
friend
was
in
town
,
and
I
thought
,
``
why
the
heck
not
?
live
a
little
!
''
so
I
brought
her
here
.
On
our
way
to
McDonald
's
,
also
known
as
``
Mickey
D
's
''
in
other
areas
,
I
begin
to
worry
that
maybe
I
should
have
called
to
reserve
a
table
in
advance
.
However
,
upon
arriving
,
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
no
line
!!
We
did
wait
a
minute
or
two
to
be
seated
,
but
apparently
,
this
is
one
of
those
seat
yourself
places
.
As
I
approached
the
front
,
I
was
immediately
mesmerized
by
their
huge
selection
of
burgers
.
Their
menu
ranged
from
McSingles
to
McDoubles
to
even
McTriples
!!
They
also
had
a
dollar
menu
consisting
of
items
costing
$
1.07
after
tax
.
I
decided
to
go
with
their
house
special
,
The
Big
Mac
,
and
their
seasonal
Chicken
``
McNugget
''
Pieces
.
When
I
opened
up
my
box
of
chicken
nuggets
,
the
pale-golden/yellow
skin
indicated
that
it
had
just
came
out
of
the
storage
unit
next
to
the
fryer
.
As
the
freshness
evaporated
with
every
bite
,
I
really
began
to
taste
all
the
other
kinds
of
meat
that
went
into
making
the
nuggets
.
I
think
I
even
tasted
some
pork
,
but
do
n't
take
my
word
for
it
.
Oh
my
God
and
then
you
have
the
dipping
sauces
!
These
little
containers
held
the
perfect
blend
of
artificial
sweetener
and
manufactured
taste
As
I
eagerly
unwrapped
my
Big
Mac
,
I
was
slightly
disappointed
to
find
that
it
was
n't
as
advertised
-LRB-
the
picture
on
the
display
made
it
seem
a
lot
bigger
!!
-RRB-
.
Oh
well
.
I
would
really
like
to
commend
the
chef
on
making
the
buns
just
how
I
like
them
,
extremely
soggy
.
I
was
even
more
impressed
that
the
soggy
,
limp
buns
were
able
to
maintain
their
round
form
.
This
is
some
pretty
advanced
cooking
technique
!!
Anyways
,
as
I
bit
into
my
Big
Mac
,
the
first
thing
I
tasted
was
the
mayo
.
Actually
,
it
was
the
only
thing
I
tasted
,
but
it
was
some
damn
good
mayo
.
Finally
,
if
you
're
watching
your
waistline
,
they
have
a
plethora
of
drink
options
.
Choices
like
Diet
Coke
,
Diet
Coke
Zero
,
Sugar-free
Diet
Coke
Zero
,
etc.
.
.
ensures
that
there
's
a
perfect
diet
drink
for
everyone
.
PS
:
Perfect
date
spot
for
Valentine
's
Day
.
Highly
recommended
!!
I
broke
down
and
was
craving
McDonald
's
and
wanted
to
check
out
the
newly
built
one
.
Ordered
the
new
bacon
clubhouse
burger
.
It
was
tasty
but
on
the
cooler
side
of
hot
.
Once
again
though
fries
as
bad
as
you
can
get
.
Cold
,
dried
out
and
down
right
uneatable
.
I
do
like
that
they
have
coke
zero
even
as
it
was
n't
mixed
properly
.
Service
,
what
service
.
No
warm
welcome
or
even
a
smile
and
it
was
a
manager
who
was
besides
himself
for
having
to
leave
his
set
position
to
help
me
the
only
customer
at
noon
in
line
.
Dining
room
looks
great
new
.
Dirty
as
all
hell
.
Looked
to
sit
at
3
high
tables
and
all
the
seats
had
greasy
soda
spots
all
over
them
.
How
hard
is
it
to
manage
a
place
like
this
.
I
've
done
it
quiet
successfully
for
many
years
.
And
yes
someone
can
contact
me
if
they
'd
like.I
am
95
%
sure
I
acquired
a
nasty
food
based
illness
here
.
I
ate
some
of
the
chicken
nuggets
,
and
within
2
hours
I
was
terribly
ill
,
vomiting
the
entire
contents
of
my
stomach
into
my
kitchen
sink
because
I
was
not
able
to
get
to
the
bathroom
.
It
was
that
bad
.
As
for
the
service
,
the
`
help
'
if
you
can
call
it
that
clearly
did
not
want
to
be
working
at
the
place
,
and
I
observed
several
questionable
hygiene
related
issues
in
regards
to
how
the
staff
handled
themselves
-
and
the
food
.
How
was
I
able
to
do
this
,
you
ask
?
Well
good
reader
,
the
reason
is
that
I
was
standing
for
10
minutes
at
the
counter
waiting
for
my
order
,
a
Hamburger
,
a
single
order
of
chicken
nuggets
,
a
baked
potato
,
and
a
large
soft
drink
.
I
had
ample
time
to
observe
these
things
.
I
know
only
the
most
`
interesting
'
person
would
actually
enjoy
working
at
a
fast
food
place
,
but
the
help
here
set
a
new
bar
of
horribleness
-
if
the
bar
was
buried
3
feet
into
the
ground
that
is
.
Add
in
the
for
lack
of
a
better
term
-
`
wiped
out
'
dining
room
which
was
filthy
,
and
you
get
fast
food
hell
.
Avoid
at
all
costs
-
go
to
another
Wendy
's
-
any
other
Wendy
's
.
Do
n't
even
want
to
give
this
place
any
stars
.
I
found
a
chunk
of
tin
foil
in
my
burger
.
I
took
it
up
to
get
a
new
one
and
the
person
did
n't
say
one
word
to
me
.
No
sorry
no
nothing
.
Just
took
the
burger
,
made
me
a
new
one
and
gave
it
back
...
without
saying
one
word
to
me
.
Customer
service
is
absolutely
terrible
which
is
a
shame
because
the
food
is
usually
good
there.Not
sure
what
happened
to
the
beef
at
Wendy
's
,
BUT
I
have
been
to
this
location
and
the
fish
hatchery
location
and
the
newer
thicker
beef
patties
have
a
strange
old
meat
flavor
.
Not
sure
when
or
if
I
will
go
back
.
This
used
to
be
a
favorite
.
Very
disappointed
.
I
wish
they
would
go
back
to
the
old
style
of
burgers.Speedy
,
friendly
service
,
rarely
messes
up
my
order
,
even
if
it
is
complicated
,
which
it
usually
is
.
Late
night
staff
get
swamped
regularly
,
but
handle
it
well
.
Great
vegetarian
and
vegan
options
.
-LRB-
I
feel
I
need
to
say
that
my
five
stars
is
versus
other
fast
food
restaurants
,
but
for
the
money
it
definitely
still
holds
its
own
.
-RRB-
After
months
of
inadequate
staff
who
constantly
messed
up
our
order
and
took
forever
,
something
changed
,
and
this
Taco
Bell
has
returned
to
what
it
had
been
.
Friendly
staff
,
reliable
service
.
And
that
tasty
Taco
Bell
quality
I
've
come
to
enjoy
when
I
'm
good
and
hammered
or
just
not
in
the
mood
to
cook
or
drive
very
far.Easily
the
best
TB
in
Madison
-LRB-
though
with
State
St
and
University/Segoe
closed
,
it
's
not
much
of
a
competition
-RRB-
.
Everything
is
made
very
well
,
very
fresh
,
and
very
fast
.
Great
service
.
The
location
rocks
too
right
between
30
and
Milwaukee
.
No
complaints
and
this
one
is
much
less
sketchy
than
the
one
on
Park.It
's
a
Taco
Bell
.
Certainly
you
have
n't
come
here
with
Rick
Bayless
expectations
,
but
it
's
still
a
top
tier
fast
food
choice
.
The
interior
is
great
and
clean
,
and
the
staff
is
generally
friendly
,
but
that
's
about
where
the
good
vibes
start
falling
.
Go
between
lunch
and
early
dinner
hours
,
and
you
'll
never
have
an
issue
.
At
least
,
I
have
n't
.
After
730pm
,
however
,
avoid
it
.
Mistakes

from
the
drivethru
,
the
waits
get
longer
as
the
night
goes
on
,
and
if
you
think
you
want
to
stop
here
around
``

''
time
,
prepare
to
be
overwhelmed
by
how
much
they
've
run
out
of
.
It
's
a
little
disheartening
due
to
the
proximity
of
our
drill
location
,
but
we
still
forget
the
late
night

get
suckered

Chalk
this
one
up
to
a
dare
to
see
if
I
could
eat

Not
a
problem
.
Interesting
clientle
aside
,
this
place
was
surprisingly
not
sucky.Red
Lobster
is
always
really
crowded
because
peeps
love
the
cheddar
biscuits
.
Who
are
we
kidding
here
?
We
all
know
it
's
the
damn
cheddar
biscuits
that
keep
em
'
coming
.
Even
the
wait
staff
knows
it
.
Our
waiter
had
his
shtick
down
to
a
science
and
his
main
sell
was
the
what
???
Cheddar
biscuits
.
In
fact
towards
the
end
of
our
meal
he
greeted
a
couple
that
had
just
sat
down
behind
us
,
and
ran
through
his
entire
spiel
word
for
word
as
he
had
done
for
us
.
The
humiliating
part
was
that
the
woman
has
the
EXACT
same
reaction
that
I
did
when
he
said
,
``
and
might
I
say
,
the
cheddar
biscuits
are
the
best
part
of
the
meal

Typical
Red
Lobster
.
Busy
.
Good
service
.
Food
is
delish
...
cant
get
enough
of
those
biscuits!Red
Lobster
is
consistently
excellent
.
The
Biscuits
may
be
a
draw
for
some
,
-LRB-
altho
I
can
only
eat
one
myself
-RRB-
.
I
go
back
over
and
over
because
of
the
great
staff
,
the
impeccable
Long
Island
Iced
Teas
and
the
always
Hot
Steamy
Perfect
FRESH
Lobster
.
Our
Madison
Red
Lobster
aims
to
please
like
no
other
chain
in
town
.
The
menu
is
extensive
and
never
disappointing
.
I
am
thrilled
to
have
them
here
.
Worth
the
time
and
money
,
every
visit.We
had
lunch
at
this
place
on
X'max
Eve
,
it
was
such
a
disappointing
lunch
given
the
food
was
not
served
30
minutes
after
we
finished
ordering
.
After
calling
the
manager
the
food
was
finally
on
the
table
but
apparently
there
is
something
within
this
restaurant
.
The
manger
was
friendly
but
the
waiter
at
our
table
was
showing
us
some
attitude
after
manager
was
called
up
.
So
,
service-wise
,
it
was
such
a
failure
.
Food
is
okay
,
just
like
any
other
red
lobster
place
,
but
please
keep
in
mind
that
waiting
for
30
minutes
is
never
acceptable.I
am
so
happy
they
are
n't
keeping
this
crab
and
scallop
``
pot
''
.
It
was
overly
messy
and
no
return
of
flavor
.
Better
off
just
having
steamed
crab
legs
instead
.
Overall
,
Red
Lobster
is
a
great
place
for
me
to
get
my
crab
fix
when
I
need
it
.
There
is
n't
any
other
affordable
place
in
town
to
support
my
cravings.My
wife
and
I
stopped
at
the
Red
Lobster
on
7/4/13
.
It
was
open
and
the
parking
lot
was
busy
.
We
started
with
the
wood
fire
grilled
bruschetta
with
shrimp
.
It
was
really
good
.
A
bottle
of
Kendall
Jackson
chardonnay
made
it
even
better
!
We
then
shared
a
trio
of
wood
fire
salmon
,
shrimp
skewers
,
and
crab
legs
.
It
came
with
a
salad
.
The
flavors
were
fine
.
The
portions
were
small
.
Our
server
was
pleasant
.
We
'd
return
,
but
would
probably
stay
at
the
bar
to
enjoy
a
bottle
of
KJ
with
2
orders
of
the
wood
fire
grilled
bruschetta
with
shrimp
and
pass
on
the
rest.love
their
special
biscuit
,
soft
and
delicious
.
the
seafood
is
fresh
and
nice
.
endless
shrimp
is
a
great
choice.I
absolutely
Love
Red
Lobster
.
I
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
eat
at
a
Red
Lobster
for
shell
fish
.
Unfortunately
,
I
have
never
had
a
good
meal
at
this
Red
Lobster
.
They
do
not
know
how
to
cook
seafood.Visited
this
location
on
2/27
with
a
friend
for
Lobsterfest
.
I
ordered
the
Lobster
in
Paradise
.
.
The
lobster
was
NOT
fresh
,
it
was
tough
and
very
chewy
.
I
was
really
bummed
out
by
this
because
I
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
dish
and
I
do
n't
normally
have
any
complaints
about
Red
Lobster
.
The
service
was
excellent
,
our
waiter
was
very
friendly
and
attentive.My
boyfriend
and
I
visited
for
the
first
time
ever
on
Thursday
.
I
work
for
Darden
,
so
I
was
expecting
great
service
and
delicious
food
.
The
food
was
nothing
amazing
,
but
it
was
still
a
decent
value
for
the
price
.
However
,
our
waiter
was
extremely
rude
.
He
acted
like
it
was
a
burden
to
serve
us
.
I
'm
assuming
it
was
our
age
,
but
that
should
n't
matter
.
I
'm
a
server
myself
and
it
's
wrong
to
treat
your
guests
like
they
are
wasting
your
time
.
It
made
the
entire
experience
quite
disappointing.Red
Lobsters
Biscuits
is
what
drives
me
to
dine
at
their
restaurant
.
However
,
now
that
they
sell
their
brand
of
biscuits
at
Costco
,
I
fail
to
see
why
I
would
ever
dine
here
again
.
I
love
seafood
.
It
's
my
favorite
food
.
However
,
Red
Lobster
seems
to
think
that
the
best
way
to
cook
a
good
seafood
dish
is
to
drown
it
in
garlic
and
butter
.
My
goodness
,
it
's
ridiculous
how
much
butter
and
oil
is
used
in
any
given
dish
.
I
am
-LRB-
was
-RRB-
a
huge
fan
of
their
Salmon
New
Orleans
.
It
came
with
wild
rice
,
broccoli
,
broiled
salmon
and
shrimp
covered
in
a
tabasco
butter
sauce
.
I
always
got
the
sauce
on
the
side
because
again
,
the
add
too
much
butter/oil
.
Since
the
dish
is
super
easy
to
make
,
I
decided
to
make
it
on
my
own
with
less
butter
.
Viola
!
Dish
turned
out
better
than
Red
Lobster
-LRB-
IMO
which
is
very
bias
I
will
admit
-RRB-
For
what
you
pay
to
get
a
good
meal
,
the
food
is
very
average
while
being
coated
in
nothing
but
butter
.
Even
the
salads
are
iffy
.
Their
food
is
nothing
special
.
The
most
decent
cooker
can
make
anything
on
their
menu
.
I
never
understood
why
the
lines
are
always
out
of
the
damn
door
when
I
drive
by
on
a
weekend
.
Convenience
?
Must
be
.
However
,
people
must
REALLY
like
it
considering
the
wait
time
on
a
Friday
or
Saturday
night
can
be
up
to
a
hour
.
If
I
am
to
leave
one
positive
comment
,
the
service
has
always
been
great
in
my
past
experience
dining
here.Solid
seafood
place
.
I
had
the
tilapia
last
visit
in
July
2014
and
it
was
tasty
.
The
service
is
good
but
not
exceptional
on
our
average
visit
.
I
could
call
this
3.5
stars
quite
honestly
.
The
one
thing
that
could
help
them
out
I
think
is
having
more
variety
of
fish
,
they
usually
have
salmon
,
mahi
mahi
or
flounder
sometimes
,
tilapia
and
one
other
fish
fry
generic
fish
like
a
cod
.
I
would
love
to
see
them
get
things
like
grouper
or
sea
bass
,
or
ever
more
tasty
fish
for
a
weekly
special
like
monkfish
or
barramundi
.
But
overall
a
solid
night
out
for
a
decent
price
for
what
you
get.I
came
through
this
dive
while
pub-crawling
amongst
friends
.
As
we
lined
up
at
the
bar
to
order
beers
and
grub
--
the
bartender
's
muttering
under
her
breath
``
oh
shit
.
''
should
have
tipped
us
off
to
the
piss
poor
service
that
awaited
us
.
Apparently
they
're
not
accustomed
to
seeing
a
group
of
~
12
people
waltz
in
this
dump
.
Go
fig
'
.
Mind
you
,
we
were
very
accommodating
,
and
considerate
of
the
surprise
rush
we
created
.
However
,
when
they
served
our
table
separately
and
completely
forgot
my
food
,
I
was
forced
to
demand
a
refund
.
They
're
lucky
I
was
n't
a
complete
a
**
hole
and
demanded
the
portion
of
the
tip
that
I
already
paid
toward
my
food
order
.
Sure
,
if
you
're
looking
for
a
very
lonely
dive
all
to
yourself
and
a
/
few
/
friends
,
this
might
be
your
place
.
But
for
us
,
it
was
a
complete
and
utter
disaster
.
Oh
,
did
I
mention
the
incessant
flies
throughout
the
establishment
?
Yeah
,
not
cool.I
have
a
feeling
this
place
usually
has
better
service
,
but
a
sudden
downpour
sent
everyone
to
Dexter
's
at
the
same
time
for
their
Fish
Fry
.
So
we
waited
...
and
waited
...
and
a
good
hour
later
our
fish
came
out
.
Folks
who
ordered
to-go
showed
up
only
to
sit
there
for
a
half
hour
and
,
well
,
wait
.
They
got
visibly
cranky
.
The
beer
battered
cod
is
really
good
,
so
are
the
waffle
fries
,
and
the
beer
guy/owner
-LRB-
?
-RRB-
is
definitely
uber
passionate
about
what
he
has
on
tap
...
just
was
n't
a
good
night
for
service
.
Do
n't
expect
anything
nice
,
this
is
just
a
small
bar/restaurant
full
of
Eastsiders
looking
for
a
great
micro-brew
and
some
good
fish.I
have
to
disagree
with
these
other
reviews
.
My
husband
and
I
frequent
Dexters
often
and
really
love
the
place
.
We
have
n't
ever
had
a
bad
experience
with
the
service
and
love
the
food
-LRB-
our
faves
are
the
waffle
fries
,
pub
chips
and
the
burgers
-RRB-
.
The
atmosphere
is
n't
all
that
,
but
nonetheless
it
's
a
great
little
neighborhood
pub
with
friendly
bartenders
,
good
food
and
great
drink
specials!Quick
Review
:
If
it
were
n't
for
the
stellar
fish
fry
and
the
awesome
beer
selection
,
this
place
would
be
a
solid
2.5-star
establishment
.
Alas
,
the
fish
is
unreal
and
the
beer
selection
rivals
many
-LRB-
if
not
most

of
Madison

Detailed
Review
:
The
Fish
Fry
Fanatics
stumbled
into
Dexter
's
Pub
this
past
Friday
and
decided
to
give
their
fish
fry
a
shot
.
The
menu
selection
is
vast
-
we
counted
at
least
6
or
7
solid
fish
fry
options
,
from
shrimp
to
Lake
Perch
to
Walleye
.
We
put
our
name
in
for
a
table
,
and
were
told
it
would
be
a
35-40
minute
wait
,
so
we
ordered
some
of
our
customary
Old
Fashioneds
.
We
were
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
the
bartenders
muddle
their
Old
Fashioneds
,
but
were
disappointed
by
the
inclusion
of
a
huge
chunk
of
orange
.
I
'm
sorry
to
say
,
but
a
Whiskey
Old
Fashioned
Sour
should
*
not
*
include
half-of-an-orange
as
garnish
.
Regardless
,
the
Old
Fashioned
was
solid
-
very
good
,
actually
.
So
much
so
that
when
we
ordered
a
second
round
and
requested
they
drop
the
orange
,
it
was
n't
a
problem
.
Dexter
's
recovered
nicely
,
and
as
luck
would
have
it
,
our
table
became
available
soon
after
we
grabbed
round
2
of
drinks
.
We
immediately
ordered
cheese
curds
,
salad
,
and
soup
.
I
went
with
the
vegetable
garden
soup
;
others
at
the
table
went
with
chili
and
salad
.
The
soup
and
salads
arrived
within
seconds
;
the
soup
was
good
-
not
great
,
but
good
-
and
it
could
've
been
a
little
warmer
.
I
'm
told
the
chili
was
good
as
well
-
not
life
altering
,
but
good
.
The
waiter
came
back
to
take
our
dinner
order
:
two
orders
of
beer
battered
cod
,
an
order
of
lake
perch
,
and
an
order
of
shrimp
.
He
said
he
'd
be
back
in
10
minutes
with
our
fish
.
Nearly
an
hour
later
,
we
flagged
down
a
waitress
for
:
refills
on
our
drinks
,
and
to
inquire
about
our
curds
and
fish
.
She
apologized
profusely
...
curds
came
out
a
few
minutes
later
-
apparently
they
forgot
about
us
.
The
only
benefit
to
being
forgotten
was
that
we
had
plenty
of
time
to
read
the
beer
menu
,
which
features
a
nice
selection
of
craft
beers
from
microbreweries
-
Dexter
's
does
n't
strike
me
as
a
place
that
would
feature
such
a
wide
selection
of
unique
beers
,
but
I
guess
it
goes
to
prove
that
you
can
never
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
.
Curds
were
excellent
-
not
your
typical
``
from
the
bag
''
curds
,
which
was
a
nice
surprise
.
They
were
breaded
and
featured
a
mild
white
cheese
;
they
were
cooked
perfectly
.
Fish
arrived
within
minutes
,
and
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
.
The
cod
was
phenomenal
.
Three
huge
pieces
with
a
mound
of
fries
-
now
that
's
what
we
're
talkin
'
about
.
The
batter
was
light
,
crisp
,
and
flavorful
.
The
fish
was
thick
,
meaty
,
and
perfectly
flavored
.
I
loved
every
single
bite
of
it
.
I
also
sampled
the
Lake
Perch
and
shrimp
-
both
of
which
were
excellent
as
well
.
Huge
props
to
Dexter
's
for
their
fish
fry
-
it
's
definitely
a
top-10
offering
.
In
the
end
,
they
also
made
things
good
as
the
waiter
comp
`
ed
us
our
drinks
and
curds
,
so
we
got
out
of
there
for
under
$
40
.
We
tipped
well
and
called
it
a
night
.
I
'd
definitely
go
back
to
Dexter
's
-
sure
,
they
dropped
the
ball
,
but
they
did
an
honorable
thing
and
made
everything
right
by
us
.
Thanks
,
Dexter

stars

keeping
.
I
ca
n't
rave
enough
about
how
delicious
the
pint
of
Gnarleywine
was
.
The
food
is
solid
,
as
many
people
have
already
Yelped
.
My
lake
perch
was
delicious
-
in
my
opinion
,
better
than
Avenue
Bar
's
.
I
was
full
when
I
finished
the
1/4
of
their
huge
serving
portion
.
Good
mix
of
crowd
.
Kids
,
20-somethings
,
old
and
all
.
I
shall
be
back
there
to
sample
more
beer
and
heckle
at
Olympic
games
on
a
TV
screen.Checked
out
Dexter
's
for
a
Friday
fish
fry
and
it
was
surprisingly
awesome
.
Great
atmosphere
for
a
neighborhood
bar
.
Unexpectedly
diverse
beer
selection
that
's
constantly
rotating
-LRB-
had
a
great
Lagunita
's
Hairy
Eyeball
-RRB-
.
Fish
was
some
of
the
best
I
've
had
in
Madison
.
Ordered
both
the
cod
&
walleye
and
both
were
delicious
--
thinly
battered
and
fried
perfectly
without
excess
grease
.
Waffle
&
brew
fries
were
delicious
too
.
Amazingly
,
after
over
a
thousand
calories
of
deep
fried
food
,
I
still
did
n't
feel
nasty
.
Thanks
for
helping
me
kinda
stay
catholic
.
Special
mention
to
their
outstanding
service
.
After
someone
stole
our
place
in
line
,
they
apologized
profusely
and
hit
us
up
with
a
free
spinach
&
artichoke
dip
appetizer
.
Very
sweet.I
wanted
fish
fry
last
night
,
but
we
did
n't
feel
like
driving
,
so
we
figured
we
'd
give
Dexter
's
a
try
.
-LRB-
It
's
3
blocks
from
our
house
.
-RRB-
My
first
impression
was
that
this
place
does
n't
belong
in
Madison
-
it
belongs
somewhere
much
farther
north
.
There
was
an
awesome
mix
of
people
there
,
which
is
always
a
good
sign
for
me
.
They
had
all
sorts
of
games
playing
on
the
multiple
tvs
-LRB-
not
just
basketball
,
hooray
!
-RRB-
and
my
boyfriend
was
delighted
to
note
that
they
have
shuffleboard
.
We
were
seated
immediately
-LRB-
pretty
good
for
a
Friday
night
-RRB-
and
placed
our
drink
orders
.
My
boyfriend
got
a
Great
Lakes
Irish
Red
something
or
other
,
and
I
ordered
a
Pyramid
Winter
Ale
,
which
was
n't
all
that
great
.
I
personally
wish
that
they
had
some
more
local
stuff
on
the
beer
menu
,
but
aside
from
that
,
I
ca
n't
really
complain
about
the
selection
.
For
dinner
,
I
ordered
beer
battered
cod
with
carrot
soup
,
and
my
boyfriend
ordered
a
burger
with
chili
garlic
fries
.
Our
food
was
AMAZING
.
This
is
hands
down
the
best
fish
fry
I
've
had
outside
of
da
nortwoods
,
definitely
the
best
I
've
had
in
Madison
so
far
.
The
soup
was
interesting
but
delicious
-
kind
of
spicy
with
a
hint
of
cilantro
.
I
did
n't
try
my
boyfriend
's
burger
,
but
the
chili
garlic
fries
were
awesome
.
I
'm
someone
who
believes
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
too
much
garlic
,
though
,
so
they
might
be
a
bit
much
for
less
of
a
garlic
lover
.
I
am
so
stoked
to
have
found
a
great
fish
fry
place
so
close
to
our
house
.
We
will
definitely
be
going
back
soon.I
'm
from
out
of
town
and
was
looking
for
a
place
to
have
some
beer
and
some
good
food
and
this
place
was
excellent
.
First
of
all
,
the
waitress
was
very
kind
with
great
service
and
helpful
advice
for
a
couple
``
newbies
''
.
The
beer
selection
was
great
and
we
got
a
pitcher
of
a
microbrew
for
$
10
,
which
I
thought
was
a
great
price
.
The
burgers
were
huge
and
very
tasty
along
with
the
cheesecurds
and
fries
.
I
will
definitely
visit
this
place
again
next
time
we
're
in
town.EXCELLENT
tap-beer
selection
with
many
microbrews
.
EXCELLENT
liquor
selection
as
well
with
lots
of
flavored
vodkas
and
rums
and
the
like
.
Prices
are
average
.
Always
a
diverse
and
friendly
crowd
.
The
food
is
okay
.
The
pizza
is
actually
pretty
delicious
,
but
the
other
food
is
not
remarkable
.
Great
jukebox
too
.
Lots
of
TVs
if
you
want
to
watch
a
game
.
The
dining
area
is
a
little
dreary
and
dark
,
but
the
bar
area
is
large
and
okay.The
food
is
good
!
I
particularly
like
the
more
unusual
offerings
,
like
the
mozzarella
rolls
.
The
pizza
is
only
mediocre
.
The
beer
selection
is
wide
and
diverse
,
with
an
emphasis
on
Wisconsin
brews
.
It
only
gets
really
crowded
for
trivia
nights
-LRB-
Tues
and
Wed
8-10
-RRB-
but
other
than
that
not
too
bad.I
have
been
to
Dexter
's
several
times
for
drinks
,
food
and
football
.
I
love
that
on
Badger
saturdays
they
have
a
shuttle
that
will
take
you
down
to
the
stadium
for
the
football
game
and
pick
you
back
up
.
Their
breakfast
is
FANTASTIC
and
very
large
portions
,
2
of
us
usually
share
something
.
They
have
a
great
selection
of
beer
and
pour
a
great
drink
too
!
The
wait
staff
is
fantastic
as
well
,
extremely
friendly
and
hard
working
.
They
seem
short
staffed
often
but
they
all
run
their
butts
off
and
there
is
hardly
a
wait
for
anything
!
Last
night
I
had
the
Rueben
w
/
waffle
fries
and
it
was
delicious
!
I
would
suggest
getting
a
big
screen
TV
for
watching
the
games
but
what
they
have
works
well
too
!
I
love
this
place
,
a
definitely
must
go
to
!
They
also
have
trivia
on
tuesday
which
is
a
blast
!
The
food
is
great
,
prices
are
cheap
,
staff
is
fantastic
...
what
more
could
you
ask
for?So
,
I
have
been
to
Dexter
's
before
to
play
some
cards
a
few
months
ago
,
but
it
was
n't
until
I
moved
into
the
neighborhood
that
I
decided
to
give
the
food
service
a
shot
.
I
ordered
a
steak
sandwich
and
some
fries
,
it
was
one
of
the
3
specials
being
offered
.
The
fries
were
decent
enough
,
but
the
sandwich
was
bland
dry
and
just
quite
dreadful
,
even
for
a
pub
.
My
friend
then
joined
me
and
we
ordered
the
worst
cheese
curds
I
've
ever
had
in
my
life
,
and
then
we
had
the
ironically
named
``
super
''
nachos
.
The
Super
Nachos
are
anything
but
super
.
The
ground
meat
-LRB-
not
positive
what
animal
it
came
from
-RRB-
was
again
under
seasoned
and
the
chips
were
stale
.
I
thought
about
sending
them
back
,
but
I
am
chalking
this
up
to
the
back
of
the
house
just
does
n't
give
a
shit
about
their
job
.
The
server
was
the
three
P
's
,
Pleasant
,
Prompt
,
and
Pregnant
.
She
was
the
reason
I
will
return
and
give
the
food
another
shot
,
and
why
this
Pub
is
getting
even
two
stars.Great
food
.
Has
a
local
feel
,
not
quite
dive-y
but
pleasantly
local
.
Not
unexpected
based
on
the
location
.
Went
for
the
Bell
's
tap

for
Mad-Craft-Beer-Week

and
I

've

's
quite
often
over
the
past
few
months
-LRB-
to
the
tune
of
around
twice
per
week
-RRB-
and
am
happy
to
report
that
every
visit
has
been
absolutely
STELLAR
.
There
's
the
obviously
excellent
beer
selection
-
it
's
constantly
rotating
,
and
it
always
tastes
fresh
and
wonderful
.
The
staff
really
know
their
beer
-
if
you
ever
have
a
question
,
do
n't
hesitate
to
ask
because
they
will
offer
a
sample
,
suggestions
,
and
plenty
of
information
.
The
food
has
been
incredible
with
every
visit
.
Sure
bets
:
the
hummus
platter
-LRB-
wow
,
that
IPA
hummus
is
unreal
-RRB-
,
the
waffle
fries
,
any
of
the
burgers
,
most
of
the
specials
,
and
of
course
,
the
fish
fry
.
I
've
had
several
burgers
-LRB-
The
Abbey
-LRB-
with
tomato
garlic
sauce
-RRB-
,
the
Defibrillator
-LRB-
onions
,
ham
,
bacon
,
egg
,
cheese
-RRB-
,
and
the
Patty
Melt
-RRB-
-
each
was
delicious
,
and
they
cook
them
exactly
to
order
.
I
've
had
the
Santa
Fe
Chicken
salad
-
wow
,
those
roasted
veggies
are
great
.
The
soups
have
also
been
excellent
-
I
recently
had
the
spicy
vegetable
and
the
chili
;
the
chili
features
a
spice
that
slowly
crescendos
-
by
the
end
of
the
cup
,
you
're
feeling
a
little
of
that
capsaicin
love
.
I
've
had
several
specials
,
including
a
turkey
melt
and
a
loaded
ham
and
cheese
.
And
of
course
,
I
've
had
the
fish
fry
several
more
times
and
am
PLEASED
to
report
that
it
remains
excellent
.
The
hearty
,
perfectly
applied
batter
and
the
flaky
fresh
cod
is
among
Madison
's
best
.
I
will
be
updating
my
fish
fry
review
with
new
pictures
and
details
in
the
near
future
.
Service
has
markedly
improved
-
the
staff
is
fast
,
friendly
,
and
as
mentioned
,
super
helpful
.
I
really
enjoy
their
company
-
it
's
great
to
drop
by
and
sit
at
the
bar
or
to
grab
a
table
and
chill
for
a
while
.

Summary
:
I
now
live
about
25
miles
from
Dexter
's
,
and
I
do
n't
hesitate
to
make
the
drive
.
If
someone
asks
,
``
feel
like
grabbing
a
bite
tonight
?
''
I
'm
always
happy
to
recommend
Dexter
's
,
even
if
it
means
a
30
+
minute
ride
.
It
's
that
good.I
love
their
friday
night
fish
fry
.
The
price
is
right
and
great
bluegil
and
perch
.
I
have
to
keep
going
back
there
.
love
it
!
I
defeintely
recommend
fish
or
even
sandwiches
,
burger
.
Oh
,
do
n't
forget
their
greasy
chili
gralic
fries
:
-RRB-
I
've
been
to
Dexter
's
several
times
before
for
drinks
and
really
liked
the
place
,
and
a
few
months
ago
we
went
for
the
Friday
fish
fry
and
the
food
was
delicious
-
some
of
the
best
fish
fry
we
've
had
in
Madison
.
However
,
when
we
went
back
a
month
or
so
later
,
we
had
a
horrible
experience
.
We
had
to
wait
nearly
45
minutes
for
our
food
and
then
when
we
got
it
-
it
was
terrible
.
My
boyfriend
had
the
garlic
chili
fries
and
they
arrived
not
only
COLD
,
but
DOUSED
in
disgusting
grease
-
they
were
inedible
.
We
mentioned
it
to
the
waitress
and
she
offered
to
bring
a
new
order
,
but
it
turned
out
the
new
order
was
just
as
terrible
as
the
first
one
.
I
had
the
roast
beef
sandwich
and
it
was
horrible
-
very
dry
and
bland
.
To
her
credit
,
the
waitress
did
give
us
free
cupcakes
to
take
home
to
make
up
for
the
horrible
food
-LRB-
although
it
turned
out
the
cupcakes
were
also
inedible
and
terrible
-RRB-
.
We
hoped
this
was
just
an
unusually
busy
night
and
not
the
norm
,
and
because
the
fish
fry
is
so
good
,
we
went
back
again
tonight
,
hoping
for
a
better
experience
.
We
were
wrong
!
We
went
around
7
and
waited
15
min
or
so
for
a
table
.
Once
we
were
seated
we
placed
our
order
right
away
with
the
waiter
,
since
we
already
knew
what
we
wanted
.
An
hour
later
,
we
were
still
waiting
for
our
food
.
All
we
ordered
was
the
fish
and
waffle
fries
-
so
nothing
complicated
-
and
on
such
a
busy
night
,
you
'd
think
they
'd
be
making
sure
to
keep
batches
of
fish
and
fries
going
steadily
into
the
fryer
.
When
we
finally
got
our
food
,
it
was
the
tasty
fish
we
'd
remembered
from
before
,
but
by
that
time
,
we
were
so
tired
and
crabby
from
having
to
wait
for
so
long
,
it
was
n't
quite
so
enjoyable
.
After
our
meal
,
we
had
to
wait
quite
a
long
time
for
the
waiter
to
bring
the
check
,
and
then
he
did
n't
come
back
to
pick
it
up
for
a
good
15
minutes
.
We
would
still
go
back
to
Dexter
's
just
for
drinks
,
but
I
do
n't
think
we
'll
be
going
there
to
eat
the
food
anymore
.
Two
terrible
experiences
with
inexcusably
long
waits
is
enough
to
keep
us
from
going
back
for
dinner
.
It
's
too
bad
because
the
fish
is
good
,
but
not
good
enough
to
justify
the
SLOW
service
.
Edit
:
Turns
out
the
fish
was
n't
so
good
-
ended
up
being
up
all
night
with
food
poisoning
.
Yup
,
definitely
will
NOT
be
going
back
there
for
dinner!Decided
to
stop
in
on
a
recent
Friday
to
try
the
fish
fry
based
on
reviews
.
Worried
that
would
be
waiting
for
a
table
,
we
went
in
hopeful
.
Got
a
booth
right
away
for
four
and
it
was
very
busy
.
I
had
been
in
here
pre-Sandlot
days
and
was
n't
impressed
but
this
``
make-over
''
is
proving
positive
.
Key
points
:
-
waitress
was
great
,
offered
tastes
of
beer
to
help
my
decision
-
perch
and
cod
,
both
good
and
plenty
of
it
-
pub
fries
were
great
,
not
overcooked
like
so
may
places
-
echoing
other
compliments
on
the
beer
selection
,
nice
-
fine
for
the
kids
too
,
at
least
earlier
around
dinner
time
-LRB-
5-7
-RRB-
I
'd
come
back
to
try
non-fish
fry
some
night.Really
nice
place
.
Great
beers
on
tap.I
will
preface
this
with
the
fact
I
deem
it
deplorable
that
a
WI
fish
fry
joint
does
not
have
pan
fish
of
some
sort
on
Friday
nights
.
I
've
been
to
Dexters
a
couple
times
now
and
am
in
love
with
one
thing
about
it
;
the
beer
selection
.
Pretty
impressive
for
a
tiny
little
place
.
Each
time
I
've
been
I
've
gotten
walleye
as
previously
stated
there
is
no
superior
crappie
,
bluegill
,
perch
,
etc.
.
.
and
I
refuse
to
order
cod
.
I
've
never
caught
a
cod
in
WI
waters
and
until
I
do
I
'm
not
ordering
it
.
The
walleye
is
ok
to
goodish
that
's
all
that
needs
be
said
.
We
again
had
the
kid
with
us
,
and
the
staff
was
very
kind
and
accomodating
.
Also
be
prepared
to
wait
for
a
table
on
Fridays
,
apparently
I
'm
the
only
fish
snob
around
and
the
cod
is
the
hot
item
I
guess
.
The
waiting
is
n't
too
bad
as
I
said
before
,
their
beer
offerings
are
pretty
boss
.
-LRB-
Yeah
I
said
`
boss
'
,
what
of
it
?
-RRB-
Lot
's
of
things
going
right
for
this
place
,
as
long
as
you
get
there
at
the
right
time
.
Great
selection
of
micro
brews
.
Interesting
and
delicious
food
.
The
last
time
I
went
in
for
food
and
a
beer
it
was
lovely
.
However
on
previous
occasions
,
I
was
freezing
in
winter
,
or
deafened
on
trivia
night
.
I
hope
they
get
a
better
announcer
and
a
better
PA
system
so
customers
do
n't
have
to
suffer
through
the
distortion.In
on
Tuesday
,
7/24
.
Tried
the
pizza
burger
after
someone
finally
decided
to
come
A.
get
a
drink
order
after
sitting
down
5
minutes
prior
.
B.
Recite
the
specials
off
the
chalk
board
because
they
did
n't
know
what
the
specials
were
.
The
burger
was
ok
,
but
did
n't
have
the
peperoni
flavor
I
would
have
expected
.
I
've
been
here
a
ton
of
times
,
and
the
food
is
for
the
most
part
,
very
good
,
but
service
this
evening
was
horrible
.
I
had
to
ask
for
another
beverage
1/2
way
through
my
meal
,
and
ultimately
walk
to
the
bar
to
pay
the
bill
.
Go
drunk
.
You
may
not
notice
that
the
staff
does
n't
give
a
crap
about
you
,
or
getting
your
money
.
We
could
have
walked
out
...
and
almost
did
without
paying.We
venture
here
often
,
as
it
's
walking
distance
from
our
house
.
Fine
fish
fry
and
good
other
offerings
.
Really
kid
friendly
before
7
-LRB-
seriously
,
the
dining
area
is
almost
like
a
day
care
sometimes
-RRB-
,
adult
friendly
after
.
Decent
beer
selection
most
of
the
time
.
Thumbs
up.I
frequent
this
place
because
it
's
close
to
where
I
live
,
and
I
do
team
trivia
on
Wednesdays
.
The
beer
selection
is
both
expansive
and
fresh
-LRB-
they
open
new
taps
frequently
-RRB-
,
and
the
food
is
excellent
bar-food
fare
with
some
healthy
salad-type
options
.
But
hey
,
you
're
there
for
bar
food
,
right
?
The
burgers
are
yummy
-LRB-
you
can
sub
in
chicken
or
black
bean
-RRB-
,
the
fries
and
rings
are
tasty
.
I
've
heard
good
things
about
the
pizza
,
but
have
n't
tried
it
.
There
are
lots
of
TVs
,
so
if
you
care
to
watch
some
sports
it
's
a
great
place
to
do
so
.
The
servers
are
very
nice
,
but
on
busy
nights
they
can
be
super
slammed
and
stretched
thin
,
so
you
may
have
to
wait
several
minutes
for
service
.
The
kitchen
is
n't
all
that
large
and
they
actually
cook
food
to
order
,
so
do
plan
to
wait
a
bit
for
your
meal
.
In
fact
,
that
's
the
only
down-side
I
can
think
of
about
this
place
-
the
service
can
sometimes
be
slow
.
If
you
're
not
into
trivia
,
I
suggest
that
you
avoid
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
nights
after
8:00
PM
or
so
,
because
that
's
when
the
trivia
crowd
is
there
and
the
place
is
packed
to
the
gills
.
**
Do
n't
pass
up
the
garlic
chile
fries
!
**
I
love
the
tap
beer
selection
and
all
of
the
entrees
we
've
tried
have
been
great!I
'm
not
sure
what
happened
to
Dexter
's
fish
fry
,
but
wow
-
it
seems
like
it
's
on
a
downward
spiral
,
which
is
unfortunate
,
because
it
used
to
be
one
of
my
very
favorites
.
I
've
revisited
this
fish
fry
three
times
this
year
,
and
each
time
has
been
underwhelming
-
I
'm
not
sure
if
they
've
switched
fish
suppliers
or
what
,
but
I
've
got
serious
reservations
about
returning
for
the
fish
fry
.
We
arrived
last
night
-LRB-
9/21
-RRB-
at
around
8:30
pm
,
and
the
place
was
packed
to
the
gills
.
As
luck
would
have
it
,
a
table
opened
up
near
the
bar
,
so
we
snagged
it
and
decided
to
eat
in
the
bar
area
.
An
extremely
helpful
waitress
immediately
took
our
drink
and
appetizer
orders
;
we
browsed
the
menu
until
she
returned
.
With
drinks
in
hand
and
the
appetizer
-LRB-
IPA
hummus
plate
-RRB-
underway
,
she
regrettably
informed
us
they
had
run
out
of
cod
.
We
opted
for
2
plates
of
the
lake
perch
and
1
plate
of
the
walleye
instead
-LRB-
I
was
dining
with
a
couple
of
friends
-RRB-
.
The
service
was
excellent
;
she
regularly
checked
on
us
,
refilled
drinks
,
and
kept
us
in
the
loop
the
entire
night
.
5-stars
for
service
.
The
fish
arrived
and
it
was
swimming
in
grease
.
Gone
was
the
excellent
batter
that
I
had
experienced
in
the
past
;
the
perch
was
rubbery
and
extreeeeeeemely
fishy
tasting
.
The
walleye
was
equally
greasy
,
over-battered
,
and
also
very
fishy
tasting
.
I
love
fish
,
and
my
friends
are
huge
fishermen
-
they
take
trips
to
Canada
,
the
boundary
waters
,
and
all
sorts
of
other
places
to
fish
.
But
even
they
agreed
that
the
fish
did
n't
taste
like
it
should
-
one
barely
finished
his
smallish
plate
of
perch
;
the
other
left
at
least
half
of
the
walleye
.
I
felt
especially
terrible
when
they
asked
me
why
I
felt
the
fish
was
so
good
here
...
:--LRB-
The
rest
of
their
food
remains
superb
,
especially
the
IPA
hummus
.
I
'm
certain
you
wo
n't
find
a
better
hummus
in
the
area
.
I
would
also
recommend
the
habanero
shrimp
and
any
of
their
burgers
-
they
're
excellent
.
Our
check
arrived
;
we
settled-up
and
left
,
disappointed
by
the
fish
.
It
's
a
shame
,
because
I
like
Nick
,
and
I
really
like
the
crew
here
,
but
something
is
amiss
...
:
-
-LRB-
Best
clam
chowder
I
've
ever
had
!
My
husband
loves
their
chili
and
I
believe
all
their
soups
are
made
from
scratch
and
I
've
always
been
pleased
...
We
typically
only
go
for
Friday
Fish
Fry
and
are
never
disappointed
,
just
be
prepared
for
a
long
wait
for
both
a
table
and
the
food
but
I
believe
it
is
worth
it
...
great
beer
choices
that
change
frequently
and
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
by
their
sandwiches
as
well
.
We
went
in
on
an
off
night
-LRB-
Monday
-RRB-
to
watch
a
football
game
...
We
were
seated
right
away
and
the
game
atmosphere
was
great
with
many
televisions
so
you
do
n't
have
to
worry
about
where
you
are
seated.I
have
been
to
Dexter
's
quite
a
few
times
now
,
usually
for
their
specialty
tappings
or
to
watch
a
football
game
.
Atmosphere
-
I
would
classify
Dexter
's
as
hole-in-the-wall
hipster-esque
classic
Wisconsin
bar
.
It
will
appeal
to
people
who
just
want
to
go
to
a
local
pub
and
crack
open
a
Hamm
's
.
It
will
also
appeal
to
people
who
want
an
unassuming
space
to
quaff
some
delicious
craft
beer
.
It
is
n't
fancy
,
but
it
is
roomy
.
My
one
complaint
is
that
it
is
always
chilly
.
I
usually
keep
my
coat
on
or
I
freeze
.
Food
-
The
food
at
Dexter
's
is
pretty
good
.
It
is
slightly
amped
up
pub
food
.
It
is
most
certainly
better
than
your
standard
pub
fare
.
They
have
some
yummy
options
for
spicy
,
heart-clogging
sandwiches
that
my
husband
loves
.
I
like
the
Fajita
salad
and
pulled
pork
sandwich
.
Beer
-
Fantastic
.
This
is
real
the
reason
to
go
to
Dexters
.
They
have
rotating
taps
of
featured
beer
.
They
are
attentive
to
trends
in
craft
brewing
and
will
often
have
something
that
is
new
and
difficult
to
find
.
Their
bartenders
are
usually
knowledgeable
about
the
beer
,
and
they
know
how
to
pour
a
hefeweizen
correctly
.
It
is
not
the
best
deal
you
will
find
in
town
,
but
they
will
also
have
pours
other
places
do
n't
get
.
Service
-
Also
pretty
good
.
I
have
no
complaints
about
the
staff
here
.
They
are
attentive
without
being
annoying
.
They
also
know
what
they
are
talking
about
which
is
refreshing
.
As
a
plus
,
in
the
warmer
months
,
they
have
an
outdoor
space
you
can
play
volleyball
.
Or
you
can
join
their
volleyball
league.Dexter
's
Pub
is
a
great
neighborhood
bar
.
Good
beer
selection
,
which
always
rotates
.
Great
service
,
friendly
staff
.
I
have
always
gone
on
Wednesday
night
for
trivia
-LRB-
8pm
-RRB-
and
its
usually
full
but
you
can
always
get
a
seat
if
you
arrive
around
7:30
pm
.
Last
time
,
I
had
the
portabella
mushroom
sandwich
.
It
was
good
,
but
sort
of
lacked
portabella
-LRB-
the
piece
was
pretty
small
and
meek
-RRB-
.
The
waffle
fries
were
good
.
Also
tried
the
hummus
one
time
,
which
was
awesome
!
Overall
,
Dexter
's
is
a
cool
spot
that
I
will
continue
to
frequent!This
has
easily
become
my
go-to
Friday
fish
fry
.
I
like
it
so
much
,
I
've
been
hesitant
to
even
write
this
review
.
Nonetheless
,
Dexter
's
does
it
right
.
Fresh
,
Bering
sea
cod
enveloped
in
a
crispy
,
salty
batter
keeps
me
dreaming
of
Fridays
.
The
clam
chowder
is
phenomenal
and
so
are
the
rest
of
their
soups
...
obviously
lovingly
tended
to
and
cooked
from
homemade
stocks
.
I
could
further
pontificate
,
but
no
need
...
the
execution
in
the
kitchen
is
stellar
.
Now
,
the
beer
list
is
exquisite
in
my
opinion
.
I
love
Madison
,
but
many
bars
get
so
caught
up
on
local-centric
taps
lists
.
Consequently
,
more
often
than
not
,
you
walk
in
to
see
the
taps
jammed
with
Ale
Ayslum
,
Lake
Louie
and
Capital
.
Not
bad
...
but
I
'll
be
damned
to
say
I
could
choke
down
another
Hopalicious
.
Dexters
,
on
the
other
hand
,
opens
their
taps
up
to
pretty
much
anything
.
From
Toppling
Goliath
-LRB-
which
I
love
,
but
you
ca
n't
really
get
outside
of
Iowa
and
Wisco
-RRB-
to
Belgian
Flander
's
Reds
,
they
kill
it
with
their
beer
selection
.
Also
,
I
really
respect
that
they
let
you
know
on
the
beer
list
what
's
on
deck
...
this
has
kept
me
coming
back
many-a-times
.
So
why
not
the
5-stars
?
Well
,
we
've
run
into
some
seriously
long
waits
,
both
for
a
table
and
then
for
the
fish
.
If
they
could
streamline
a
little
more
in
the
kitchen
,
I
'd
gladly
give
it
that
extra
star
.
In
the
mean
time
,
we
NEVER
come
here
on
Fridays
after
6pm
...
forget
it
.
If
you
do
n't
mind
dining
with
the
Greyhairs
...
you
'll
do
just
fine.After
reading
several
rave
reviews
for
the
fish
fry
we
decided
to
try
this
place
.
We
arrived
at
5:30
on
a
Friday
in
Lent
and
knew
we
were
already
in
trouble
when
parking
was
hard
to
find
.
The
dining
room
was
packed
and
we
were
told
there
would
be
an
hour
wait
.
Since
we
had
driven
across
town
,
we
decided
to
wait
it
out
in
the
bar
.
There
is
plenty
of
room
to
wait
and
have
a
beer
from
the
huge
selection
they
have
.
In
30
minutes
we
were
called
for
our
table
.
Two
of
us
ordered
the
lake
perch
and
one
ordered
the
deep
fried
cod
.
There
is
also
baked
cod
,
walleye
,
blue
gill
and
shrimp
to
choose
from
.
The
fish
comes
with
your
choice
of
-
baked
potato
,
waffle
fries
,
pub
fries
,
homemade
potato
chips
,
and
some
other
things
like
cottage
cheese
etc.
.
We
had
waffle
fries
,
potato
chips
and
the
pub
fries
,
which
are
beer
pattered
.
You
also
get
a
small
container
of
cole
slaw
and
a
white
grocery
store
roll
.
There
was
a
short
wait
for
our
fish
,
but
the
dining
room
was
still
packed
.
When
it
arrived
,
it
was
hot
,
tasty
and
a
generous
serving
.
We
were
all
very
satisfied
with
our
dinner
.
I
thought
the
homemade
potato
chips
were
excellent
,
they
came
out
warm
and
crispy
.
The
only
thing
I
did
not
care
for
was
the
tartar
sauce
,
ca
n't
place
what
it
was
,
but
had
a
funny
taste
to
it
to
me
.
Everyone
that
waited
on
us
was
friendly
and
efficient
without
being
intrusive
.
Wish
this
place
was
closer
to
my
side
of
town
,
but
we
will
definitely
try
it
again
.
Get
there
early
or
expect
to
wait!Absolutely
the
best
place
to
get
a
delicious
Reuben
and
brew
fries
in
town
!
My
favorite
dive
on
the
Eastside
of
Madison.I
started
out
on
a
quest
to
find
Madison
's
best
fish
fry
and
stumbled
upon
this
place
.
One
thing
to
know
beforehand
is
they
do
not
take
reservations
and
they
pack
the
place
on
Friday
nights
.
Expect
to
wait
a
while
.
This
is
a
nice
little
neighborhood
bar
on
the
east
side
of
Madison
that
has
a
huge
following
.
They
offer
several
different
types
of
fish
for
the
Friday
fish
fry
.
Fried
or
Baked
Cod
,
Perch
,
or
Walleye
.
I
went
with
the
fried
cod
which
was
absolutely
delicious
.
I
could
n't
turn
down
the
garlic
chili
fries
or
their
home
made
chili
.
Needless
to
say
I
could
have
used
a
wheel
chair
for
the
way
out
!
It
was
by
far
one
of
the
better
fish
fry
joints
to
go
to
in
town
and
I
will
for
sure
be
back
.
My
only
complaint
with
the
place
was
that
they
do
n't
take
reservations
and
they
wo
n't
do
carry
out
during
lent
-LRB-
due
to
an
overwhelming
amount
of
business
-RRB-
but
it
's
good
to
see
a
business
that
does
so
much
business
they
have
to
turn
some
away.Easily
one
of
my
favorite
local
hangouts
,
Dexter
's
is
a
``
dive
''
bar
without
the
``
dive
.
''
The
beer
selection
is
wonderful
,
bartenders
and
staff
are
knowledgeable
and
attentive
,
and
the
food
is
well
above
typical
bar
food
standards
.
There
are
tables
for
dining
,
a
long
bar
for
sitting
and
watching
the
game
,
and
volleyball
courts
out
back
for
summer
fun
.
If
you
're
going
for
the
food
,
I
have
to
recommend
the
fish
fry
and/or
nacho
platter
.
If
you
're
going
for
the
beer
,
you
wo
n't
be
disappointed
.
And
if
you
're
looking
for
a
fun
place
to
watch
a
Badger
victory
with
friends
,
you
've
got
the
right
bar

Met
my
wife
for
drinks
&
dinner
at
Dexter
's
Pub
.
They
have
a
great
tap
beer
selection
-LRB-
lots
of
micro
brews
-RRB-
.
They
also
have
many
bourbon
and
whiskey
options
.
I
opted
for
a
cold
and
yellow
pint
of
PBR
.
I
rode
my
bike
after
all
.
We
started
with
their
hummus
plate
.
We
'd
recommend
you
ask
them
to
put
the
pita
on
the
flat
grill
vs.
having
them
fried
or
plain
.
We
had
them
plain
which
was
okay
.
There
were
plenty
of
crisp
veggies
.
We
then
shared
a
catfish
po
`
boy
with
fries
.
The
catfish
was
generous
and
tasty
.
The
bread
was
okay
.
The
fries
were
great
.
They
do
a
great
job
for
only
having
a
flat
grill
and
a
deep
fryer.No
carry
out
on
Friday
nights
!?!
I
'm
new
to
the
area
and
was
looking
to
trying
Dexters
Friday
fish
fry
after
hearing
so
many
great
reviews
.
Unfortunately
I
did
n't
get
the
chance
as
they
do
not
provide
a
carry
out
option
on
Friday
nights
.
I
was
speechless
went
told
this
over
the
phone
!
I
did
try
another
place
-LRB-
Brothers
Three
-RRB-
that
was
happy
to
provide
carry
out
to
this
customer
and
it
was
wonderful
!
9/27/13
My
wife
and
I
stopped
in
for
lunch
.
Their
catfish
po
`
boy
is
even
more
awesome
because
their
bread
improved
!
They
have
many
great
reasons
to
stop
in
,
but
if
you
have
n't
tried
Central
Waters
Hop
Rise
Session
Ale
or
Central
Waters
Satin
Solstice
Imperial
Stout
grab
a
seat
and
imbibe!The
food
is
great
and
the
craft
beers
are
even
better
.
The
staff
is
very
friendly
but
I
docked
them
two
whole
stars
because
the
service
is
very
untimely
.
You
will
often
spend
time
waiting
for
what
you
want
,
and
if
you
are
in
a
large
group
prepare
to
be
there
a
long
time.How
hard
is
it
to
franchise
a
Portillo
's
?
You
know
,
the
Chicago
hot
dog
,
beef
world
famous
chocolate
cake
shake
chain
?
It
's
a
question
that
's
been
running
through
my
mind
since
moving
to
Madison
where
I
have
had
no
luck
finding
an
authentic
Chicago
style
Italian
beef
sandwich
.
Until
Lydia
dished
that
Dexter
's
is
way
more
than
a
hip
hangout
for
trivia
.
-LRB-
And
she
was
right
.
-RRB-
They
have
THE
BEST
Italian
beef
sandwich
I
've
found
in
the
608
and
pretty
darn
near
close
to
Portillo
's
.
Only
thing
that
's
slightly
off
from
the
hundreds
of
sandwiches
I
swallowed
back
in
the
windy
city
-
the
bread
.
But
that
's
not
enough
to
make
me
never
want
to
order
it
again
...
in
fact
I
'm
thinking
about
going
there
tomorrow
.
The
atmosphere
leans
more
neighborhood
dive
which
might
not
make
you
say
,
``
let
me
see
a
menu
,
''
but
do
!
Because
there
's
a
solid
selection
of
typical
bar
fair
kicked
up
a
notch
and
healthier
alternatives
too
if
you
're
not
a
fan
of
fried
.
The
craft
beer
selection
is
solid
and
changes
often
...
so
often
that
they
designed
an
app
for
smartphones
so
you
keep
track
of
what
's
what
!
THEY
HAVE
AN
APP
!
And
while
I
did
n't
partake
,
I
hear
housemade
desserts
are
pretty
rad
.
I
'm
ok
going
back
to
try
one
,
it
means
I
can
get
another
sandwich.I
do
n't
live
quiiiiite
close
enough
for
this
to
be
MY
neighborhood
bar
,
but
it
meets
all
the
requirements
:
laid-back
atmosphere
,
great
food
,
and
seriouslygreatcraftbeerlist
.
Their
beers
are
all
of
the
cant-pick-up-at-the-gas-station
variety
and
it
's
worth
coming
by
just
for
that
--
the
menu
diversity
is
the
cherry
on
top
of
my
craft
beer
float.After
going
to
the
Yelp
event
,
I
could
not
wait
to
go
back
!
We
went
for
Wednesday
night
fish
fry
.
This
is
not
a
year
round
occurrence
from
my
understanding
.
More
like
,
a
fall
occurrence
.
I
was
with
5
other
people
.
Four
ordered
the
fish
fry
.
There
were
three
fish
options
.
The
most
expensive
was
$
14
and
was
a
huge
amount
of
food
.
One
of
my
friends
ordered
the
fish
baked
and
it
looked
amazing
.
I
tried
the
Italian
Beef
.
While
,
it
is
not
a
Chicago
style
sandwich
,
it
did
not
disappoint
.
It
was
the
closest
I
have
found
to
Chicago-style
.
It
would
almost
be
there
,
except
for
the
bread
.
My
only
complaint
?
Adding
your
side
to
the
price
of
the
sandwich
.
Otherwise
,
the
owner
is
friendly
,
the
staff
is
friendly
.
The
beer
menu
is
ridiculously
long
.
Go
to
Dexter
's
,
it
will
not
disappoint.We
drove
45
minutes
through
rain
and
rush
hour
darkness
to
get
here
,
but
were
not
disappointed
.
Service
was
fast
and
we
had
two
great
beers
and
our
soup
before
we
knew
it
.
One
of
the
best
beer
lists
in
town
too
!
Great
homemade
chips
and
french
onion
dip
and
a
locally
made
pretzel
with
great
dips
came
next
.
Smelt
fry
was
great
!
Very
lightly
breaded
as
advertised
-LRB-
nothing
like
the
pre
breaded
frozen
kind
-RRB-
and
great
tartar
sauce
.
Pizza
had
great
thin
crust
.
We
would
definitely
come
back
again
for
many
reasons.As
a
non
beer
lover
-LRB-
I
know
,
I
know
-RRB-
,
I
was
n't
expecting
to
fall
in
love
with
Dexter
's
.
I
do
n't
think
one
has
to
worry
about
that
considering
my
experience
.
Our
food
was
just
so
...
terrible
.
I
ordered
the
salmon
salad
,
not
having
any
huge
expectations
with
it
due
to
ordering
it
at
a
hipsterish
hole
in
the
wall
type
establishment
.
The
salmon
was
a
weird
color
...
it
had
greasy
fried
peppers
,
croutons
,
tomatoes
and
cucumber
...
I
was
pretty
sure
I
was
going
to
get
food
poisoning
but
miraculously
,
I
did
not
.
My
husband
ordered
a
burger
...
the
bun
was
dry
and
crusty
,
he
asked
for
it
medium
well
and
it
was
slightly
alive
still
.
Plus
,
they
did
n't
even
provide
a
leaf
of
lettuce
or
tomato
.
Just
cheese
,
a
ball
of
raw
hamburger
and
1/3
of
a
slice
of
bacon
.
Our
meal
was
so
unsatisfying
but
at
least
the
waffle
fries
were
the
highlight
of
the
night!Just
in
case
anyone
was
wondering
...
the
Italian
beef
sandwich
and
hot
wings
are
just
as
tasty
when
you
take
them
to
go
.
You
know
...
in
case
you
needed
that
information
.
I
crisped
up
the
waffle
fries
in
the
oven
when
I
got
home
,
and
it
was
like
sitting
there
.
But
without
the
friendly
faces
and
awesome
tap
line
up.Still
tasty
!
This
is
just
an
update
to
say
that
trivia
night
is
only
on
Tuesdays
now
,
and
Friday
night
is
very
busy
with
their
fish
fry
-
so
go
early!I
love
Dexter
's
.
It
's
a
short
walk
away
,
so
I
go
there
a
lot
.
I
've
been
there
dozens
of
times
.
Their
daily
specials
are
usually
what
I
check
out
,
and
they
come
with
a
cup
of
soup
.
And
that
soup
is
usually
amazing
.
Their
chili
is
always
fantastic
.
Their
fish
fry
is
also
very
good
.
They
have
a
beef
brisket
sandwich
called
the
BBLT
that
is
always
really
good
.
They
have
plenty
of
beer
on
tap
,
and
plenty
of
televisions
for
your
viewing
pleasure
.
The
staff
is
always
friendly
and
willing
to
recommend
something.My
husband
,
my
mom
,
and
I
braved
Dexter
's
on
a
Friday
night
for
fish
.
Oh
man
,
I
am
so
glad
we
did
!
We
went
into
it
expecting
a
wait
,
and
we
did
end
up
waiting
about
an
hour
and
a
half
.
At
first
,
we
had
to
stand
in
the
bar
area
,
but
we
got
drinks
relatively
quickly
and
were
able
to
snag
a
table
after
about
a
half
hour
of
standing
.
Their
beer
selection
is
amazing
.
I
tried
3
different
new-to-me
beers
and
there
were
still
a
bunch
more
I
wanted
to
taste
.
Hooray
for
options
!
We
ordered
soon
after
sitting
down
and
did
n't
have
to
wait
long
for
our
appetizer
-LRB-
spinach
dip
with
veggies
&
pita
-RRB-
.
The
dip
was
good
and
their
pita
-LRB-
fried
-RRB-
was
as
awesome
as
you
would
assume
fried
pita
would
be
.
Our
meals
were
great
too
!
Between
the
three
of
us
we
had
cod
,
perch
-LRB-
or
bluegill
?
woops
,
ca
n't
remember
-RRB-
,
and
a
shrimp
po-boy
.
I
would
order
any
of
our
three
choices
again
.
In
summary
:
the
fish
fry
is
worth
the
wait
&
the
Friday
night
crowd.We
went
to
Dexter
's
on
Friday
for
the
fish
fry
at
the
start
Craft
Beer
week
.
So
we
knew
the
wait
would
be
long
.
It
was
about
an
hour
or
more
wait
to
eat
.
But
that
did
n't
matter
because
we
got
to
have
a
couple
of
tasty
beers
.
Once
we
sat
down
to
eat
,
we
started
off
with
the
clam
chowder
.
I
loved
it
.
The
chunks
of
clam
were
huge
and
tender
,
not
chewy
.
The
soup
was
n't
too
thick
that
it
overshadowed
the
clams
,
onions
and
potatoes
.
We
both
ordered
the
deep
fried
cod
.
One
of
the
best
we
've
had
.
It
came
out
hot
and
crispy
.
The
batter
was
n't
too
oily
and
you
could
taste
the
flakey
cod
.
The
waitress
was
very
busy
but
always
available
if
we
needed
anything
.
I
ca
n't
wait
to
eat
there
more
.
I
love
the
atmosphere
at
Dexters
.
It
's
a
great
mix
of
people
who
are
friendly
and
there
to
enjoy
the
beer/food
.
Dexter
's
is
a
nice
neighborhood
bar
with
good
beer
selection
,
and
GREAT
drink
specials
.
Always
something
to
drink
for
cheap
.
I
only
discovered
this
when
looking
for
a
place
to
watch
the
Stanley
Cup
playoffs
-LRB-
Go
Hawks
!
-RRB-
.
The
food
is
pretty
mediocre
.
The
pizza
is
good
-
they
seem
to
make
it
fresh
.
I
probably
would
n't
go
out
of
my
way
to
come
here
had
I
not
lived
in
the
neighborhood
at
the
time
.
The
pub
quiz
seems
to
be
a
good
pull
on
Tuesdays
,
outdoor
volleyball
too
,
and
the
crowd
seems
fun
in
general.This
place
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
reasons
known
by
me
and
Steve
L.
:--RRB-
I
'm
fairly
new
to
the
world
of
craft
beers
,
but
I
'm
a
big
fan
of
the
beer
list
here
.
Always
something
new
and
interesting
to
try
.
I
have
n't
had
a
proper
dinner
here
yet
,
just
appetizers
.
They
have
been
just
``
ok
''
.
The
menu
sounds
promising
,
though
.
I
like
the
open
style
of
the
kitchen
area
,
always
curious
to
see
what
folks
are
up
to
in
there
.
The
wait
staff
was
very
attentive
,
if
slightly
impersonal
,
as
well
.
I
found
it
odd
that
a
waitress
was
allowed
to
work
wearing
flip
flops
,
though
.
-LRB-
I
notice
details
.
-RRB-
It
was
a
nice
cozy
place
to
wind
up
the
end
of
my
work
week
last
night
.
To
be
continued
...
Have
n't
been
back
for
the
fish
fry
for
quite
some
time
,
but
have
been
in
for
drinks
and
appetizers
on
numerous
occasions
since
the
last
review
of
nearly
2
years
ago
.

Old
Country
Buffet
is
above
average
as
far
as
American
buffets
go
.
If
you
're
in
the
mood
for
it
,
it
's
pretty
tasty.It
's
old
country
buffet
,
what
do
you
expect
?
Lots
of
different
stuff
to
choose
from
,
and
definitely
caters
to
those
who
want
to
eat
themselves
into
bland
oblivion
.
If
you
go
here
looking
for
exotic
,
flavorful
,
unusual
cuisine
skillfully
prepared
by
a
fantastic
chef
you
must
be
well
deluded.Ahhhhh
,
``
The
land
of
&
''
A
meal
&
a
heart
attack
,
or
1000
cc
's
of
insulin
.
Never
was
a
fan
of
Old
Country
Buffet
,
but
the
new
revamp
has
brought
some
life
into
this
old
staple
.
It
's
still
full
of
Blue
Hairs
and
people
who
sport
clothes
that
are
covered
w
/
stains
and
holes
.
Also
,
if
you
are
rotund
like
I
am
,
your
self-esteem
will
be
boosted
when
you
realize
no
matter
how
fat
you
are
,
their
is
always
someone
fatter
at
the
Hometown
Buffet
.
Food
choices
here
are
awesome
.
Mexican
,
American
,
Italian
...
all
piping
hot
and
ready
to
pig
on
.
The
salad
bar
has
surprisingly
fresh
veggies
and
staff
works
hard
to
keep
the
place
clean
and
well
stocked
.
Too
bad
every
freakin
kid
in
the
place
has
to
touch
everything
,
wipe
their
hands
on
their
nose
,
then
bare
hand
the
items
.
I
even
saw
the
staff
kick
some
woman
out
for
filling
up
an
old
``
Country
Crock
''
container
w
/
chicken
wings
.
I
guess
takeout
is
n't
allowed
.
LOL
Good
desert
choices
too
.
Soft
serve
and
the
usual
box-made
cakes
and
pies
.
The
quality
of
the
food
wo
n't
win
any
awards
.
Not
nearly
as
good
as
a
freshly
prepared
5
star
meal
,
but
better
than
prison
.
What
do
you
expect
for
$
9.95
?
For
those
that
like
an
abundance
of
mediocre
food
that
is
poorly
cooked
than
this
is
the
place
to
be
.
For
those
that
actually
like
good
food
I
would
suggest
another
restaurant
and
preferably
not
a
chain
.
The
only
saving
grace
was
the
frozen
yogurt
and
the
fried
shrimp.Okay
selection
of
hot
and
cold
stations
for
a
buffet
restaurant
that
is
near
the
interstate
and
right
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
.
The
sweet
station
made
my
day
-
frozen
yogurt.If
you
are
into
buffets
,
try
them
out
.
Food
is

.
Food
is
hot

Good

.
It
's
good
for
a
family
of
picky
eaters.All
you
can
eat
for
under
$
10
...
...
what
is
there
to
complain
about
??
If
you
want
junk
food
and
you
want
lots
of
it
oh
this
is
THE
place
to
go
!
You
've
got
several
hungry
mouths
to
feed
and
not
that
much
$
$
in
the
wallet
...
then
this
is
THE
place
to
go
.
Other
than
that
I
'm
not
sure
why
you
would
go
here
...
Truly
a
guilty
pleasure
.
I
love
the
salad
bar
-LRB-
it
always
has
chick
peas
-RRB-
.
I
certainly
have
a
weak
spot
for
the
meatloaf
and
the
sweet
ketchup
sauce
,
in
fact
it
my
favorite
meatloaf
in
town
.
Do
I
always
end
up
with
heart
burn
?
You
bet
!
Will
I
come
back
again
-LRB-
mostly
cause
the
6
'
-5
''
teen
boy
always
asks
-RRB-
?
Of
course!This
buffest
reminded
me
of
a
Las
Vegas
buffet
except
all
the
food
gave
me
heartburn
.
I
'd
been
to
a
hometown
buffet
before
so
when
my
bf
suggested
it
I
relied
on
my
memory
of
the
experience
and
agreed
to
go
.
Unfortunately
my
memory
must
have
been
jilted
by
the
occasion
or
this
Hometown
Buffet
was
just
bad
,
I
dont
know
.
what
I
do
know
is
that
the
food
is
cheap
,
about
10
$
per
person
.
It
is
also
soft
.
And
by
this
i
mean
everything
is
overcooked
.
And
it
all
gave
me
heartburn
that
lasted
all
day
.
So
will
I
be
back
?
Maybe
in
about
10
years
when
I
've
forgotten
about
this
experience.I
love
the
Mac
n
cheese
.
But
the
last
time
I
went
,
I
grabbed
a
chocolate
cake
.
When
I
took
my
first
bite
,
I
was
hard
!
And
the
cheese
cake
was
not
good
either
.
$

Cheap

american

Not
much
more
to
say
.

I
have
been
to
this
hometown
buffet
multiple
times
,
a
lot
for
family
holidays
.
Recently
we
moved
to
California
,
went
to
a
hometown
buffet
here
,
and
were
severely
disappointed
.
Hopefully
we
wo
n't
get
food
poisoning
,
but
it
is
n't
looking
very
promising
I
wanted
to
write
a
review
on
the
Madison
one
since
it
is
sooo
much
better
.
First
off
,
great
selection
of
food
!
Beyond
great
.
I
do
n't
think
I
have
tasted
something
I
did
n't
like
.
We
normally
always
have
the
same
waiter
,
his
name
is
Carlos
,
and
he
is
great
!
The
manager
Tony
is
THE
BEST
!
Seriously
!
I
miss
going
to
this
place.I
go
here
solely
for
the
fried
chicken
and
chicken
tenders
,
with
sides
of
mashed
potatoes
with
gravy
and
stuffing
.
The
yeast
rolls
are
nicely
honey
buttered
.
The
salad
and
fruit
bar
is
really
good
too
.
But
the
other
choices
do
n't
interest
me
.
The
dessert
are
not
too
good
except
the
ice
cream.So
this
is
a
typical
buffet
.
Wide
selection
of
food
and
it
was
decent
.
They
had
a
good
spread
for
Thanksgiving
with
all
the
typical
food
and
sweets
.
I
would
not
be
a
regular
,
but
when
I
am
looking
for
a
huge
meal
that
is
decently
priced
,
I
will
visit
Hometown
again
.
Since
I
visited
on
Thanksgiving
the
place
was
packed
.
The
staff
did
a
great
job
keeping
the
buffet
well
stocked
and
I
was
seated
in
about
10
miniutes.Surprisingly
excellent
Easter
Dinner
.
Prime
rib
to
die
for
-LRB-
better
than
we
've
had
at
Great
Dane
's
brunch
-RRB-
,
and
their
homemade
horseradish
cream
is
really
good
.
Actually
has
some
snort
to
it
!
Coconut
cream
pie
&
carrot
cake
both
delicious
.
May
become
our
new
Easter
tradition
!
-LRB-
Sure
liked
not
having
to
clean
up
my
trashed
kitchen
!
-RRB-
Wow
this
place
is
the
suck
.
We
ate
there
twice
.
The
first
time
the
tofu
was
massively
burned
to
a
crisp
and
the
second
time
I
found
a
rusty
fishing
hook
in
my
pasta
bowl
.
WTF
??
I
've
eaten
at
other
locations
and
they
are
just
fine
,
but
this
one
must
have
bad
staff
and
management
problems
because
they
are
the
SUCK
.
Stay
away.Good
food
,
reasonable
prices
.
I
've
been
to
the
location
on
Univ
avenue
and
it
's
pretty
good.I
like
the
East
town
location
.
Good
food
,
love
the
ability
to
eat
on
the
patio.Location
is
a
lot
different
than
the
downtown
one
,
crazy
busy
around
the
lunch
hour
...
but
the
food
...
oh
the
food
!
There
is
nothing
like
the
indo
peanut
.
It
may
not
be
authentic
,
but
it
is
delicious
,
for
sure
.
Worth
a
stop
-
be
extra
nice
to
the
staff
,
they
are
awesome.I
love
Noodles
&
Company
,
and
fact
being
this
one
is
only
a
few
miles
away
from
my
home
when
I
drive
back
from
work
-
I
always
call
in
for
a
pick
up
.
My
penna
rosa
is
the
best
from
here.I
might
have
found
a
new
addiction
.
I
ca
n't
count
the
number
of
times
I
visited
Noodles
and
Company
while
I
was
in
Madison
.
I
loved
it
so
much
that
I
emailed
them
to
see
if
they
would
open
one
in
Auburn
.
Only
time
will
tell
.
I
really
only
tried
their
Asian
menu
.
I
tried
the
Japanese
udon
noodles
and
the
Vietnamese
peanut
saute
,
with
the
later
being
my
favorite
.
I
've
had
the
Pad
Thai
in
the
past
-
when
I
lived
in
Columbia
MO
,
and
I
remember
that
being
excellent
as
well
.
It
is
fast
food
but
really
does
n't
feel
like
it
.
The
food
comes
to
you
after
you
are
seated
in
fine
white
china
.
Everything
I
've
tried
has
been
wonderfully
made
and
essentially
everything
on
their
menu
is
vegetarian
.
You
can
add
a
protein
if
you
desire
.
The
only
blah
item
was
the
Flatbread
.
I
have
visited
three
different
locations
in
Madison
.
This
one
is
a
bit
smaller
than
the
one
on
University
but
it
is
still
great
.
The
employees
keep
the
tables
clean
and
are
always
willing
to
help
.
I
love
Noodles
.
I
know
I
'll
be
back
a
few
more
times
before
headed
back
to
my
village
of
Auburn.Always
a
family
favorite
!
Tastes
great
,
cheap
,
and
filling!Wonderful
as
always
.
It
's
our
go-to
for
a
quick
bite
to
eat
.
Your
kids
will
like
the
Wisconsin
Mac
n
Cheese
.
Mine
do.It
's
been
5
years
since
I
've
been
here
ya
'll
!
The
last
time
I
was
here
I
bit
down
on
what
appeared
to
be
a
rusty
piece
of
metal
resembling
a
fish
hook
.
However
,
because
we
like
to
live
life
on
the
edge
we
decided
to
go
here
again
this
last
weekend
.
I
did
n't
have
any
noodle
dishes
this
time
though
,
I
tried
the
strawberry
spinach
salad
minus
the
blue
cheese
and
bacon
.
It
was
really
,
really
good
.
Everything
tasted
fresh
and
the
balsamic
fig
dressing
was
delicious
.
My
dining
companion
and
the
minor
had
the
Indonesian
noodle
bowl
with
tofu
,
and
the
thai
bowl
.
They
both
seemed
to
enjoy
their
dishes
.
Guess
what
?
No
one
got
forked
with
a
piece
of
metal
this
time
!!!
Indications
for
going
back
look
good.I
go
here
all
the
time
-LRB-
about
4
times
a
month
-RRB-
and
i
have
never
had
a
bad
meal
or
bad
service.I
love
Noodles
but
this
location
is
going
downhill
fast
.
They
undercook
/
overlook
my
chicken
every
time
.
They
are
also
getting
good
at
under
boiling
noodles!Food
is
always
great
tasting
and
ready
in
no
time
!
Also
they
have
a
great
variety
of
pastas
and
sandwiches
.
Ca
n't
say
enough
about
how
awesome
this
place
is!Hidden
vegan
item
bursting
with
flavor
that
even
the
most
zealous
carnivore
could
endure
:
Whole
Grain
Tuscan
Linguine
sans
cream
topped
with
tofu
.
Giggity
.
If
you
've
not
had
the
pleasure
of
sinking
your
chompers
into
their
Ride
Krispy
Treat
,
you
're
not
living
life
to
the
fullest
.
I
'm
convinced
the
generous
wedge
of
ooey
gooey
marshmallowy
goodness
is
straight
out
of
an
angelic
bake
sale
recipe
book
.
I
do
n't
want
the
secret
-
I
just
want
them
to
never
stop
-
ever.I
think
this
might
be
the
only
place
in
the
area
that
consistently
gets
my
order
right
.
I
always
get
take
out
so
I
ca
n't
speak
to
the
dine-in
experience
.
My
food
is
always
fresh
,
the
proper
temperature
,
nicely
packaged
and
correct
.
This

in

has
been

The

service
was

were

you
are
slow

was
there
for

night
-RRB-
but
7-8
dirty
tables
with
nobody
walking
around

clean

kind

gross
as

not

Good
service
,
and
the
fare
I
've
come
to
expect
from
Noodles
locations.I
can
finally
say
that
I
've
been
to
the
elusive
Eagle
's
Crest
in
the
sticks
of
northeast
Madison
.
Two
days
later
,
I
am
still
struggling
to
digest
the
burger
I
consumed
on
Sunday
morning
.
They
do
n't
even
glamorize
this
real-deal
burger
with
16oz
beef
,
8
strips
bacon
and
a
think
layer
of
melty
cheese
for
$
8
.
I
ca
n't
even
see
how
they
make
money
.
Is
it
the
best
burger
in
Madison
?
I
do
n't
think
so
.
It
's
not
very
well
seasoned
and
the
massive
amount
of
meat
is
hard
to
handle
.
Is
it
an
adventure
in
fun
townie
bar
that
has
good
cocktails
?
Yes.Horrible
service
.
We
went
for
``
Taco
Tuesday
.
''
We
waited
for
nearly
15
minutes
before
walking
up
to
the
bar
to
ask
if
we
could
get
some
service
.
``
I
thought
you
were
helped
''
the
lady
grunted
at
me
as
she
took
our
order
.
She
was
the
only
bar
keep
in
the
place
.
Must
have
an
Alzheimer
's
style
memory
.
Nearly
10
minutes
later
our
drinks
showed
up
.
We
witnessed
others
get
their
food
that
had
ordered
after
we
did
.
We
ordered
the
taco
special
,
so
being
``
Taco
Tuesday
,
''
one
would
think
these
would
be
readily
available
.
Finally
after
1/2
hour
,
we
got
our
food
tossed
on
the
table
.
The
personable
waitress
did
n't
notice
our
drinks
were
empty
,
so
I
had
to
walk
the
glasses
to
the
bar
to
get
them
refilled
.
While
waiting
quietly
,
some
Harley
-
riding
local
came
in
and
he
was
greeted
like
royalty
.
He
barged
right
in
front
of
me
and
he
got
served
pronto
.
The
bar
tender
went
to
him
like
files
to
a
fresh
pile
of
doo
.
Thanks
.
Looks
like
the
only
way
you
'll
get
served
here
is
if
you
are
known
by
the
employees
,
ride
a
Harley
,
have
more
tattoos
than
stripper
convention
or
poor
hygiene
.
The
food
was
decent
.
At
$
5.75
for
a
taco
,
the
price
was
awesome
.
I
'd
go
back
if
it
were
n't
for
the
lousy
service
.
Maybe
I
should
buy
a
new
Electra-Glide
next
time
I
want
a
taco.This
place
was
gross
and
depressing
.
We
live
nearby
,
but
I
will
avoid
ever
going
back
.
We
went
to
Taco
Tuesday
and
were
greeted
with
horrible
service
and
even
worse
food
.
I
did
not
come
here
expecting
anything
nice
or
classy
,
so
even
with
low
expectations
I
left
feeling
slightly
down
and
depressed
from
this
sad
place.I
try
to
not
speak
like
a
rapper
,
but
``
haters
gon
na
hate
.
''
Seriously
,
this
place
is
a
dive
bar
,
not
a
high-end
french
restaurant
.
The
servers
sometimes
double
as
bartenders
.
You
do
not
go
to
this
place
for
the
fast
service
,
that
is
what
people
made
McDonald
's
for
.
You
go
for
the
1lb
.
burgers
!
They
range
from
$
7
-
$
8
.
How
do
they
make
money
?
Is
it
the
best
burger
?
No
.
Is
it
in
the
top
5
of
burgers
that
I
have
eaten
?
Yes
.
Definitely
.
Everything
is
well
thought
out
right
down
the
to
the
bun
choice
.
The
burgers
all
come
with
kettle
chips
.
I
hate
kettle
chips
.
Hate
them
.
You
know
what
?
I
ate
theirs
.
So
good
.
Yeah
,
the
service
took
awhile
,
but
you
do
not
go
to
a
dive
bar
to
get
out
of
there
fast
.
The
server
was
friendly
and
precise

I
did
not
want
onions

I
did
not
get

.
That
care
barely
be
said
about
high
end
restaurants
.
It
was
nice
to
sit
back
and
relax
and
then
the
burger
came
.
They
are
huge
.
I
had
a
cheeseburger
.
I
barely
made
it
through
half
.
They
are
cooked
medium
well
,
but
they
are
still
so
juicy
.
The
vegetables
are
fresh
and
generous
.
I
had
two
pieces
of
tomato
large
enough
that
one
covered
the
burger
.
My
friend
had
the
bacon
cheeseburger
.
I
could
barely
see
the
burger
under
the
bacon
.
It
was
amazing
.
I
dared
not
try
that
on
my
first
time
out
.
I
can
not
wait
to
try
their
hot
ham
and
cheese
.
It
comes
with
two
HUGE
slices
of
ham
.
They
have
brunch
on
Sundays
.
I
am
talking
myself
down
from
finding
any
excuse
to
go
there
again.If
you
are
craving
a
massive
bar
burger
from
a
towny
bar
,
this
is
the
place
to
go
.
The
burgers
are
so
large
that
you
should
plan
on
cutting
it
in
half
and
take
the
other
half
home
.
They
are
excellent
!
If
you
order
the
bacon
burger
,
you
can
expect
at
least
6
plus
long
stripes
on
bacon
on
it
,
I
was
completely
amazed
with
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
burger
.
Amazing
.
I
have
also
been
to
the
Eagle
Crest
on
Taco
Tuesday
.
Prepare
yourself
for
the
largest
taco
you
will
ever
see
.
If
you
order
the
taco
salad
they
give
you
a
very
large
plate
stacked
high
with
chips
and
all
the
fixings
.
It
's
great
.
More
than
any
one
person
can
eat
in
one
sitting
.
This
is
a
bar
people
!
Do
n't
expect
proper
waitress
service
,
the
bar
tenders
are
serving
you
most
of
the
time
.
Just
be
happy
that
this
particular
bar
has
amazing
food
.
Since
this
is
a
bar
,
maybe
the
best
Bloody
Mary
in
town
.
It
comes
in
a
large
mug
with
2
huge
shrimp
,
a
beef
stick
,
pickle
,
and
green
olives
.
A
meal
in
itself
.
If
your
hungry
and
do
n't
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
,
this
is
the
place
I
would
suggest
.
My
new
favorite
bar.I
had
gone
to
Eagles
crest
for
lunch
a
few
times
and
decided
to
take
my
family
,
from
out
of
town
,
one
weekend
.
When
we
arrived
,
there
was
a
sign
on
the
front
door
saying
that
it
was
customer
appreciation
day
.
We
Bought
a
round
of
drinks
and
found
a
table
to
sit
at
.
Other
patrons
were
going
through
the
food
line
which
was
set
up
at
the
pool
table
.
But
my
sister-in-law
went
To
get
a
veggie
plate
,
One
of
the
female
staff
came
from
around
the
bar
and
slapped
the
plate
out
of
her
hand
And
told
us
that
we
were
not
welcome
there
.
We
finished
our
drinks
and
left
.
As
we
were
leaving
we
checked
the
sign
on
door
again
to
see
if
it
was
marked
private
party
,
but
it
was
not
.
After
that
experience
I
will
never
go
back
to
Eagles
Crest.Yum
,
yum
,
yum
.
I
felt
the
need
to
update
the
restaurant
.
Nothing
has
changed
and
that
is
what
I
love
!
Consistency
is
appreciate
when
the
quality
is
so
high
.
I
appreciate
that
their
burgers
are
as
special
,
juicy
and
flavorful
as
always
.
They
are
not
trying
to
dress
up
the
place
or
make
things
so
fancy
.
The
truth
is
,
they
stick
to
good
,
simply
and
quality
food
.
So
thank
you
for
staying
the
same
and
staying
fabulous.Service
was
atrocious
.
We
're
en
route
from
Baraboo
to
Chicago
and
had
a
group
of
7
.
Though
it
was
Memorial
Day
,
the
restaurant
was
n't
packed
yet
we
waited
25
minutes
for
a
table
.
Another
20
before
our
orders
were
taken
and
drinks
brought
.
The
restaurant
itself
was
truly
filthy
-
stained
,
disgusting
carpet
and
very
poor
layout
so
patrons
are
walking
through
service
areas
.
Not
cool
.
Should
have
gone
to
Log
Cabin
in
Baraboo.when
we
got
there
we
ask
for
a
couple
minutes
to
decide
on
food
and
beverages
...
after
the
server
had
not
come
back
for
25
mins
we
left
.
Your
food
is
not
that
great
so
customer
service
should
be
where
you
shine
.
.
just
a
tip
.
I
will
never
return
to
this
location.Two
adults
and
one
kid
equals
a
40
dollar
meal
.
It
's
not
like
we
ordered
everything
on
the
menu
either
.
The
kid
had
pancakes
and
a
drink
,
the
adults
each
had
an
omelet
and
one
drink
.
The
pancakes
were
great
,
but
the
omelets
were
super
salty
,
and
the
ingredients
were
the
furthest
thing
from
fresh
.
The
service
was
horrible
.
They
kept
forgetting
things
,
and
it
felt
like
they
were
trying
to
rush
us
out
the
door
,
even
though
there
was
only
one
other
table
there
.
Another
reviewer
mentioned
having
to
walk
through
a
service
area
,
and
it
's
true
.
To
get
to
the
bathrooms
you
have
to
walk
through
a
narrow
service
area
that
seems
awkward
.
The
bathrooms
were
nasty
dirty
,
next
time
I
'll
just
hold
it
.
To
top
it
off
I
got
food
poisoning
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
suffering
immensely
.
Thanks
International
House
of
Poop
!!!
Too
institutional
.
Out
of
a
can
,
bag
,
box
,
or
freezer
.
Parking
is
very
limited
.
Not
a
fan.It
's
old
.
It
's
small
.
The
staff
was
attentive
.
Food
showed
up
quick
and
tasted
like
IHOP
food.TERRIBLE
MANAGEMENT
!
-
Over
a
year
after
I
quit
working
at
this
IHOP
because
of
terrible
management
.
I
called
in
a
to-go
order
for
my
boyfriend
and
I
-
When
I
got
there
,
I
ended
up
having
issues
with
my
debit
card
so
I
ended
up
running
across
the
street
to
pull
money
out
of
the
bank
.
When
I
got
back
,
I
asked
Jenelle
,
the
manager
,
if
I
could
have
my
food
warmed
up
cause
it
was
cold
and
she
approached
me
with
an
atrocious
attitude
,
and
told
me
nope
and
walked
off
.
So
I
said
,
alright
,
forget
it
,
and
left
the
$
30.00
in
food
and
walked
out
the
door
.
I
will
never
eat
there
again
because
I
've
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
food
gets
cold
and
hard
almost
immediately.Though
there
are
some
very
good
breakfast
places
closer
to
our
home
,
my
husband
is
enamored
of
IHOP
pancakes
.
So
when
we
get
coupons
in
the
Sunday
paper
we
come
here
for
breakfast
.
They
underwent
some
sort
of
change
last
year
.
The
place
closed
down
,
then
seemed
to
reopen
almost
immediately
-
hiring
new
people
-LRB-
judging
by
the
help
wanted
sign
on
the
marquee
-RRB-
and
redecorating
.
The
decor
is
bland
and
unremarkable
-
standard
American
Chain
Restaurant
style
.
We
never
had
any
problems
with
the
food
before
-LRB-
we
go
maybe
four
times
a
year
-RRB-
.
The
food
is
still
fine
.
I
personally
wish
they
had
more
crepes
on
the
menu
but
will
survive
with
my
lingonberry
sauce
.
As
others
have
mentioned
,
you
do
need
to
walk
through
a
narrow
wait
station
on
the
way
to
some
of
the
tables
.
I
do
n't
like
this
,
but
the
staff
all
seem
used
to
it
and
so
it
is
n't
the
worst
thing
ever
.
I
've
never
used
the
restroom
so
ca
n't
comment
on
that.So
my
family
and
I
are
trying
to
enjoy
our
meals
while
a
group
of
customers
on
the
other
side
of
the
incredibly
small
dining
room
are
having
a
loud
conversation
,
taking
calls
via
their
cell
phone
speakers
,
and
listening
to
YouTube
videos
on
their
phones
.
I
tell
our
server
about
it
and
the
manager
is
then
informed
.
When
the
manager
walks
past
the
group
to
investigate
,
they
're
not
being
noisy
so
nothing
is
said
.
The
noise
then
picks
up
again
and
our
server
comes
by
to
drop
off
our
check
.
We
're
told
that
our
meal
is
comped
by
50
%
,
which
I
'll
obviously
take
,
but
that
nothing
was
being
done
about
the
noise
because
the
manager
did
n't
hear
anything
.
So
my
complaint
was
without
merit
and
the
loud
group
should
n't
have
been
told
that
other
customers
were
complaining
about
the
noise
they
were
making
?!
What
an
incompetent
manager
!
The
food
was
merely
meh
.
Other
than
the
noise
issue
,
our
server
was
fine.Neighborhood
delivery
and
takeout
great
...
certainly
a
step
higher
than
the
other
chains
in
this
level
.
They
do
n't
biast
305-stars
for
Papa
John
's
?
Am
I
crazy
?
Yes
.
Probably
.
But
it
really
is
worth
of
the
rating
.
Why
?
-
So
easy
to
order
online
;
brilliantly
intuitive
and
logical
-
The
inside
of
the
store
is
spotless
-
I
've
never
seen
it
in
disarray
-
Staff
is
friendly
and
efficient
-
Consistent
quality
;
there
's
no
hoping
the
pizza
is
as
good
as
a
previous
time
-
it
just
is
-
Never
greasy
-
Quite
possibly
the
best
``
well
done
thin
crust
''
pizza
I
've
ever
had
in
the
Madison
area
.
It
holds-up
without
flopping
over
,
even
when
piping
hot
,
and
it
's
always
perfectly
cooked
,
without
being
burned
or
overly
charred
.
I
'm
not
a
fan
of
their
commercials
or
PJ
's
personal
philosophies
.
That
said
,
I
have
yet
to
find
a
better
thin
crust
in
Madison
.
I
'll
keep
looking
,
though.Papa
John
's
is
great
pizza
!
Unfortunately
,
I
never
had
the
opportunity
to
get
it
delivered
.
After
calling
the
store
I
was
informed
the
front
door
of
my
residence
was
past
the
delivery
boundary
.
My
back
door
is
adjacent
to
the
street
they
deliver
to
.
Did
n't
matter
to
the
phone
operator
and
never
even
considered
finding
a
way
to
make
it
work
.
The
employee
's
response
,
``
the
boundary
has
to
be
set
somewhere
''
works
in
theory
unfortunately
this
customer
lives
in
reality
.
Really
disappointed
with
the
service
being
offered
.
I
understand
there
are
policies
but
being
20
feet
past
an
arbitrary
boundary
is
absurd
.
Thanks
Papa
!!
Standard
Chinese
fare
done
well
with
very
friendly
service
and
quick
orders
to
go
-LRB-
typically
15
minutes
max
-RRB-
.
If
the
menu
were
more
interesting
this
would
be
a
4-star
joint
.
Nevertheless
,
the
dishes
are
great
values
,
so
I
come
by
fairly
often
for
pickup
.
A
large
order
of
one
dish
lasts
me
two
nights.Grade
:
B
-
Aside
from
the
sub
zero
restaurant
temp
and
the
scary-looking
Mongolian
Warriors
-LRB-
just
out
of
the
time
machine
-RRB-
belching
loudly
while
dining
,
this
food
was
good
and
inexpensive.Personally
,
my
favorite
chinese
food
place
in
Madison
.
They
have
excellent
food
,
excellent
service
,
large
portions
-LRB-
which
are
awesome
reheated
at
home
-RRB-
and
inexpensive
!
I
love
it
!
My
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
always
freezing
in
there!Got
some
take-out
from
there
based
on
the
reviews
on
this
site
.
Quite
expensive
and
very
low
quality
,
like
what
one
would
expect
from
the
crummy
delivery
places
around
here
but
not
delivered
and
costing
as
much
a
a
nice
meal
other
places
.
I
usually
think
the
`
good
'
chinese
places
have
decent
hot
and
sour
soup
,
this
stuff
was
the
thick
inedible
slop
straight
out
of
a
cheap
buffet
.
I
dunno
if
I
was
expecting
too
much
but
this
certainly
did
not
deliver.Quality
is
consistent
and
prices
are
more
than
fair
.
The
staff
is
very
kind
and
accommodating
.
It
's
our
go
to
Chinese
carry-out
.
I
would
n't
say
it
's
the
most
authentic
,
but
then
again
,
it
's
delicious
and
cheap!Owners
Lon
and
Wong
are
super
-LRB-
and
always
there
,
which
makes
it
consistent
-RRB-
.
Ambiance
and
winter
heating
are
lacking
,
but
the
food
is
always
hot
and
good
.
A
jewel
of
a
place
in
a
town
with
few
decent
Chinese
restuarants
...
Excellent
Ma-Po
tofu
,
I
usually
do
not
order
this
because
of
how
simple
it
is
to
make
at
home
,
but
was
very
glad
that
I
did
.
The
service
is
always
extremely
good
.
Speaking
of
which
,
the
waitress
I
have
had
both
times
I
visited
is
one
of
the
best
wait
staff
I
have
had
anywhere
,
including
much
pricier
venues
.
Prices
are
great
and
everything
I
have
tried
is
very
well
done.Friendly
staff
and
quick
service
but
,
unfortunately
they
could
n't
make
up
for
the
unappetizing
dining
room
and
BLAND
food
.
I
'll
be
shopping
around
for
another
Chinese
place.This
place
was
recommended
to
me
as
some
of
the
best
Chinese
food
in
Madison
.
Totally
agree
!
I
went
here
for
a
Wednesday
lunch
at
2
pm
and
I
was
the
only
person
there
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
stereotypical
,
but
if
you
've
ever
walked
into
an
empty
Chinese
restaurant
in
the
mid
afternoon
...
you
're
probably
going
to
have
to
make
your
presence
known
by
ringing
a
bell
or
yelling
an
awkward
``
hello
''
towards
the
kitchen
.
Not
in
this
case
,
I
was
promptly
greeted
and
offered
to
sit
anywhere
.
My
food
was
excellent
.
Nothing
daring
,
just
general
tso
's
chicken
.
Good
sauce
,
good
flavor
,
good
consistency
.
Lunch
does
n't
get
any
better
at
$
4.95
which
includes
an
entree
,
rice
,
and
soup
!
Summary
:
friendly
service
,
awesome
food
,
good
prices
.
I
'll
be
back.Really
great
Chinese
food
.
Something
about
this
restaurant
gives
you
the
impression
that
the
cooks
and
staff
really
care
about
your
food
.
Everything
is
delicious
and
there
's
a
sense
that
it
's
more
`
homemade
'
than
other
Chinese
restaurants.I
've
only
eaten
in
Wong
's
a
few
times
.
I
really
prefer
to
get
the
takeout
.
They
are
very
nice
about
making
substitutions
-LRB-
I
hate
onions
!
-RRB-
.
I
got
ta
say
that
the
food
from
this
restaurant
is
really
good
and
the
service
is
very
nice
.
I
came
here
and
a
lady
served
me
and
she
also
was
very
attentive
.
Price
is
always
good
when
you
're
student.Zoinks
.
You
know
how
you
drive
by
a
place
over
and
over
and
think
...
``
Man
why
have
n't
I
tried
that
!
''
Weeeeeeeeeeellllll
it
kills
me
to
say
but
sometimes
it
's
for
the
best
.
After
tripping
up
and
down
Atwood
for
5
months
going
from
here
to
there
,
I
finally
bit
the
bullet
and
gave
them
a
try
.
While
the
woman
-LRB-
owner
I
assume
-RRB-
helping
me
was
lovely
,
the
food
was
all
Wong
.
Sorry
.
Bean
sprout
overload
populated
the
chop
suey
-LRB-
a
safe
choice
I
thought
because
its
so
standard
-RRB-
,
the
eggroll
lacked
flavor
outside
of
the
peanut
butter
used
to
seal
it
and
the
egg
foo
young
which
was
a
guilty
pleasure
staple
of
carry
out
growing
up
made
me
feel
GUILTY
,
like
really
guilty
for
consuming
it
.
Oily
and
in
an
all
too
rich
sauce
,
it
just
did
n't
jive
with
my
belly
.
I
'd
say
I
will
go
back
,
but
honestly
I
feel
like
I
went
pretty
safe
,
pretty
standard
.
I
'd
be
afraid
to
try
again
and
branch
out.This
was
decent
for
Chinese
.
The
service
was
great
and
the
people
were
friendly
.
However
the
food
was
run
of
the
mill
Chinese.My
sister
brought
this
great
restaurant
to
my
attention
and
I
will
forever
be
thankful
.
She
's
been
coming
here
for
several
years
so
I
knew
that
this
place
had
something
going
for
it
,
and
boy
it
really
did
.
For
our
lunch
stop
,
we
ordered
the
general
tso
's
chicken
,
kung
pao
chicken
,
and
the
house
special
chow
mein
.
All
were
above
average
,
but
the
general
was
beyond
expectations
.
The
breaded
chicken
pieces
were
out
of
this
world
--
soft
,
pillowy
-LRB-
yes
pillowy
-RRB-
and
simply
addicting
with
each
bite
.
If
you
're
into
Chinese
like
I
am
,
you
know
that
many
general
tso
's
chicken
dishes
tend
to
be
overly
breaded
,
crusty
,
and
include
questionable
chicken
parts
rolled
into
one
.
Not
this
place
!
You
got
ta
check
it
out
.
As
for
the
kung
pao
&
house
special
,
they
both
could
have
had
more
umff
and
kick
to
it
,
but
good
nonetheless
.
The
only
thing
we
worried
about
as
we
enjoyed
our
3
dishes
was
the
lack
of
patrons
.
We
got
here
just
before
2pm
on
a
Wednesday
and
there
was
only
one
customer
and
a
few
pickup
orders
.
What
's
the
dealio
Madison
?
I
've
been
to
nearly
all
the
Chinese
joints
in
Madison
and
this
place
for
sure
ranks
pretty
high
.
To
our
assurance
,
the
lady
owner
said
they
were
swamped
the
other
day
so
that
made
us
feel
slightly
better
.
Besides
the
great
food
,
their
prices
are
more
than
reasonable
and
the
service
is
genuinely
inviting
.
The
lunch
menu
does
n't
include
anything
over
$
5.95
,
which
includes
an
entree
,
rice
,
and
soup
.
The
lady
owner
-LRB-
who
recognized
my
sister
from
previous
visits
-RRB-
talked
with
us
for
quite
some
time
and
enjoyed
playing
with
my
baby
nephew
while
we
ate
.
All
in
all
,
a
great
visit
that
will
definitely
make
me
come
back
for
more
.
^

We
moved
to
the
atwood
area
about
a
year
ago
,
and
have
visited
Wongs
several
times
.
It
does
not
have
an
ambiance
to
write
home
about
,
but
the
food
has
been
consistently
good
:
flavorful
,
not
greasy
and
very
reasonable
portions
and
prices
.
The
owners/staff
are
all
very
nice
and
friendly
too
.
Its
not
a
place
to
bring
a
hot
date
,
but
for
a
nice
quick
meal
its
a
great
spot.Think
Panera
Bread
with
more
of
a
coffee
shop
feel.If
you
like
light
to
medium
roast
coffee
this
is
the
place
to
be
.
I
could
n't
find
better
one
on
east
side
of
Madison
in
last
few
years
with
the
same
consistency
.
Always
not
too
slow
not
too
busy
.
You
can
hear
another
person
if
you
are
not
alone
.
Never
had
a
problem
.
Had
lunch
once
,
if
I
remember
correct
it
was
on
ok
side
.
Plenty
of
free
parking.I
like
this
place
.
The
service
was
prompt
with
a
smile
.
Everytime
I
went
while
visiting
Madison
the
coffee
was
great
.
They
either
have
an
excellent
roaster
,
or
train
their
staff
really
well
-LRB-
or
both
-RRB-
.
I
like
my
coffee
to
taste
like
coffee
.
Not
the
sugary
,
foo
foo
,
macha
frappa
jacka
whatever
.
So
if
you
believe
that
coffee
roasting
is
an
art
and
not
a
fad
,
check
this
place
out
.
It
has
a
great
energy
too
.
Local
art
and
jewelry
designers
are
supported
there
and
there
is
a
cozy
fireplace
!
Good
post
movie
date
spotThis
place
is
OUTSTANDING
!
It
is
the
perfect
location
to
meet
up
with
friends
or
go
to
by
yourself
.
The
noise
level
is
perfect
not
too
loud
.
.
not
to
quiet
.
Plus
,
besides
the
great
selection
of
drinks
-LRB-
especially
sugar-free
-RRB-
they
also
have
a
wide
selection
of
food
unparalleled
to
starbucks
or
caribou
.
Happy
Sipping!We
really
like
this
place
.
Cozy
,
fireplace
,
really
good
coffee
.
Some
nice
paintings
on
the
wall
but
the
one
is
a
myth
.
It
shows
Monona
Terrace
with
the
sun
setting
nearby
.
-LRB-
I
think
it
is
the
sun
-
I
forget
-RRB-
Anyway
,
the
terrace
sits
toward
the
north
and
it
would
be
pretty
tough
to
paint
the
sun
there
.
Other
than
that
it
is
a
good
painting
.
The
painting
of
downtown
Madison
in
the
rain
is
fantastic
.
I
wonder
if
I
could
buy
that
one
?
Enjoy
the
coffee.So
I
was
in
Madison
the
other
day
picking
up
my
carpooler
near
the
East
Town
Mall
and
I
admit
...
I
was
trying
to
find
anything
that
would
give
me
a
caffeine
buzz
...
okay
I
admit
it
,
I
was
seeking
out
a
Starbucks
because
at
this
point
...
Anything
will
do
!!
I
Yelped
Coffee
Shops
nearby
and
got
this
little
gem
!
Too
cute
!
Coffee
was
awesome
and
also
got
a
bagel
to
go
.
The
scene
inside
was
comfy
and
cozy
,
too
bad
I
had
to
jet
,
otherwise
I
would
have
enjoyed
sipping
on
my
java
inside
instead
of
on
the
highway
!
I
am
happy
I
know
about
this
place
tucked
back
off
the
well
beaten
path!Staff
did
not
acknowledge
us
in
any
way
until
we
ordered
,
and
were
unable
to
answer
basic
questions
about
their
products
.
We
ordered
a
chicken
salad
sandwich
;
it
was
adequate
,
but
I
've
had
better
.
It
was
accompanied
by
a
small
bag
of
off-brand
kettle
chips
and
a
tiny
plastic
sample
cup
full
of
``
pasta
salad
''
,
which
was
just
some
tough
,
flavorless
penne
noodles
sprinkled
with
oregano
.
I
expect
a
side
dish
accompanying
a
sandwich
to
be
small
,
but
seriously
,
a
sample
cup
?
Maybe
it
was
intended
to
be
decorative
.
We
also
had
a
``
classic
''
smoothie
,
which
was
supposed
to
be
made
with
real
fruit
and
contain
strawberries
,
banana
and
orange
.
It
was
decent
,
but
so
heavy
on
cheap
orange
juice
that
it
overpowered
the
other
flavors
.
Aside
from
the
disappointing
food
and
lack
of
service
,
it
seemed
to
be
a
nice
enough
space
.
They
had
some
distinctive
furniture
and
a
variety
of
seating
,
including
both
a
bar
and
comfy
chairs
around
a
fireplace
;
a
private
room
in
the
back
available
for
reservation
;
and
a
large
outdoor
patio
featuring
a
sandbox
for
the
kids
.
The
food
seemed
over-priced
for
the
quality
,
but
overall
the
pricing
was
competitive
with
other
cafes
in
the
area
;
while
I
ca
n't
recommend
it
for
lunch
,
the
patio
might
be
a
good
place
for
parents
to
meet
for
coffee
while
their
kids
play
in
the
sandbox
.
Honestly
,
I
ca
n't
see
any
other
reason
to
come
here.I
have
lunch
here
all
the
time
.
The
veggie
wrap
,
Greek
breakfast
burrito
and
the
caprese
sandwich
are
terrific
.
They
serve
great
local
coffee
and
desserts
too
.
The
meeting
room
in
the
back
can
be
reserved
for
small
groups
-LRB-
say
10-15
-RRB-
.
Friendly
staff
and
locally
owned.Great
coffee
,
amazing
atmosphere
.
Food
is
also
really
really
good
!!
Healthy
lunch
items
on
the
menu
.
Quiches
are
delicious
,
hot
,
but
not
made
to
order
.
Can
be
a
little
pricey
on
the
beverage
side
-LRB-
$
3-5
for
lattes
,
coffee
,
mocha
,
or
hot
chocolate
-RRB-
.
Urban
interior
with
cozy
surroundings
.
Snuggle
up
to
the
fireplace
or
find
a
table
or
up
top
counter
to
plug
in
the
computer
.
I
like
the
mix
of
people
and
the
free
WiFi
while
sipping
on
a
Hot
Chai
Latte
.
Kiddie
area
outside
and
inside
.
Patio
area
in
summer
is
nice
but
not
shaded
.
Back
room
area
is
great
for
10-15
people
and
can
be
reserved.Cool
Beans
saved
my
Christmas
vacation
!
While
in
town
visiting
family
over
the
holidays
,
my
hubby
and
I
found
Cool
Beans
.
It
was
our
refuge
as
we
endured
the
stresses
of
visiting
family
.
The
coffee
and
food
is
good
.
The
3-way
fireplace
is
awesome
!
What
a
terrific
place
to
hang
out
,
not
be
bothered
,
and
work
on
the
computer
.
The
staff
is
friendly
the
place
is
clean
and
inviting
.
The
East
Side
has
needed
a
place
like
this
for
a
long
time
,
and
I
'm
glad
that
Cool
Beans
has
finally
filled
that
niche
.
The
next
time
we
're
in
town
,
we
'll
make
sure
to
stop
in
for
a
cuppa
Joe.Absolutely
best
coffee
in
Madison
,
topped
with
a
healthy
serving
of
excellent
service
.
Ambiance
is
perfect
for
studying
-LRB-
this
is
,
in
fact
,
my
second
home
-RRB-
,
hanging
out
with
friends
,
reading
a
book
by
the
fire
,
or
conducting
a
business
meeting
.
They
have
an
excellent
assortment
of
drinks
-LRB-
caffeinated
and
not
-RRB-
and
food
.
Skip
the
poor-tasting
,
cookie-cutter
Starbucks
and
experience
some
real
coffee
made
by
people
who
actually
take
pride
in
their
job
...
and
check
out
the
latte
art
before
you
put
your
lid
on
--
they
're
getting
good
!
:
-RRB-
Good
food
,
comfy
environment.Cool
Beans
.
Neato
.
Far
out
.
When
did
speech
become
so
convoluted
with
things
like
verbs
and
syntax
?
Lucky
for
us
,
Cool
Beans
on
the
east
side
keeps
it
real
...
in
more
ways
than
one
.
First
off
,
the
seating
is
plentiful
,
and
when
you
add
a
cool
outside
space
during
the
warmer
months
,
there
's
no
shortage
of
real
estate
if
your
going
at
it
solo
or
in
a
huge
group
.
There
's
even
a
back
room
that
looks
like
it
can
be
closed
off
with
a
set
of
doors
.
Coffee
and
tea
are
what
you
'd
expect
,
not
the
best
brew
I
've
had
in
town
,
but
certainly
not
the
worst
.
But
it
's
their
food
options
that
blew
me
away
originally
.
They
really
take
the
whole
``
cafe
''
thing
to
a
new
level
with
a
plentiful
amount
of
soup
,
salad
and
sandwich
options
to
satisfy
anyone
.
Think
Panera
,
but
much
better
.
Much
much
better
.
The
particular
day
I
was
there
I
dug
into
some
minestrone
and
a
half
of
a
jerk
sandwich
served
up
on
a
toasted
pita
.
Both
were
quite
tasty
.
Add
some
free
WIFI
and
decadent
looking
pastries
and
you
have
the
makings
for
a
pretty
nifty
spot
for
chit-chat
,
laptop
'n
or
busting
out
the
bridge
set
.
People
still
do
that
,
right?This
is
a
great
place
to
study
or
to
get
your
post-workout
smoothie
!
The
ambiance
is
great
for
studying
,
just
loud
enough
to
keep
me
from
feeling
antsy
and
quiet
enough
that
I
do
n't
get
annoyed
by
other
patrons
.
This
is
possibly
the
best
cafe
for
a
balance
of
coffee
and
food
.
I
would
actually
eat
here
,
as
opposed
to
most
coffee
shops
.
Really
,
90
%
of
the
time
I
'd
rather
starve
than
eat
the
stale
baked
goods
.
Also
,
right
next
to
Princeton
Club.Very
nice
atmosphere
.
The
White
chocolate
macadamia
nut
latte
was
awesome!There
are
a
lot
of
things
I
liked
about
Cool
Beans
Cafe
.
-
It
's
local
and
not
a
chain
-
The
post
it
note
collage
reading
material
provided
for
you
while
you
wait
for
your
coffee
-
The
featured
non-profit
highlighted
on
the
back
table
on
the
way
to
the
restrooms
-
The
three
sided
fireplace
-
The
local
artists
work
and
jewelry
for
sale
However
,
I
find
the
coffee
overpriced
for
the
quality.Cozy
and
fun
coffee
shop
.
I
've
had
a
sandwich
and
chai
tea
a
few
times
with
a
friend
here
.
I
have
bought
two
of
their
coffee
cups
and
I
love
them
.
Great
place
to
chill
out
on
a
cold
day.I
have
been
to
Cool
Beans
a
couple
of
times
thanks
to
a
co-worker
.
This
is
a
great
place
to
grab
a
cup
of
coffee
with
a
friend
or
meet
for
a
work
meeting
.
The
coffee
is
great
and
I
usually
buy
the
endless
cup
as
I
stay
for
a
couple
of
hours
.
The
food
is
great
as
well
.
The
sandwiches
are
definitely
something
to
try
.
The
staff
are
very
friendly
and
the
atmosphere
is
cozy
.
There
are
tables
and
chairs
throughout
and
then
there
are
some
comfy
chairs
if
looking
for
a
more
relaxed
seat
.
If
you
are
in
Madison
on
the
East
Side
this
a
great
place
to
go.This
place
is
cute
,
very
comfortable
inside
and
the
staff
is
really
nice
:-RRB-
I
got
a
breakfast
sandwich
and
a
white
chocolate
mocha
both
were
so
delicious
!!
skip
the
starbucks
and
head
over
here
,
I
would
highly
recommend
this
place!Another
great
local
cafe
found
by
the
power
of
yelp
!
This
cafe
is
right
by
the
major
highways
and
was
on
my
way
driving
through
IL
.
Its
on
your
right
side
after
you
turn
into
the
street
and
the
sign
is
easy
to
find
.
This
place
has
lots
of
seating
,
a
great
big
fireplace
in
the
middle
with
couches
around
it
makes
the
environment
very
inviting
to
sit
down
and
chat
with
friends/coworkers
.
I
tried
an
iced
mocha
with
whipped
cream
topped
,
they
offer
their
coffee
in
3
sizes
.
With
my
iced
mocha
I
also
ordered
a
chocolate
croissant
.
Both
were
delicious
and
there
were
so
many
different
choices
in
dessert
that
i
want
to
try
!
Next
time
Im
in
the
area
I
am
definetly
going
to
have
to
try
their
tiramisu
!!
This
place
may
be
out
by
the
mall
,
but
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
write
in
Madison
.
The
staff
here
are
amazingly
helpful
.
The
coffee
is
fabulous
-LRB-
locally
roasted
-RRB-
,
the
food
is
fresh
and
tasty
,
and
-LRB-
even
though
it
isnt
advertised
-RRB-
they
have
Gluten-Free
bread
!!!!
:-RRB-
They
even
have
a
separate
meeting/gathering
room
.
Love!I
was
on
the
east
side
for
the
evening
and
saw
Cool
Beans
.
I
remembered
I
had
a
coupon
and
decided
to
try
them
out
.
The
staff
was
helpful
in
making
my
choice
of
drink
,
I
got
the
Turtle
latte
.
It
was
so
amazing
and
the
girl
and
the
guy
who
were
working
there
were
friendly
as
could
be
.
I
will
be
going
back
!
Worth
checking
out.Fresh
ingredients
!
I
had
the
grilled
veggie
sandwich
.
It
was
good
but
next
time
I
'll
ask
if
they
can
throw
some
pesto
on
it
as
well
.
Had
a
bite
of
my
husband
's
grilled
chicken
pesto
and
ca
n't
get
the
flavor
out
of
my
mind
...
mmm.I
love
stopping
at
Cool
Beans
for
a
quick
work-day
lunch
!
It
's
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
bring
a
friend
when
we
're
meeting
up
during
the
work
week
.
Their
food
is
great
and
made
fresh
-
I
've
never
had
a
bad
dish
here
,
but
my
favorite
is
the
grilled
vegetable
sandwich
with
the
side
salad
.
I
am
also
a
big
fan
of
their
coffee
drinks
.
Hazelnut
lattes
are
my
go-to
.
Great
little
cafe
!!!
Monty
's
is
a
Madison
favorite
.
Breakfast
all
day
.
Fantastic
comfort
food
.
Friendly
service
.
Veggie
options
.
While
nothing
spectacular
,
it
's
consistently
pretty
damn
tasty
.
Of
note
:
popular
breakfast
-LRB-
expect
to
wait
-RRB-
and
the
Meatloaf
of
the
Gods.Great
old
school
diner
with
some
tasty
comfort
food.Honestly
,
I
ca
n't
see
what
the
fuss
is
all
about
with
Monty
's
.
It
's
certainly
a
staple
of
the
Madison
community
,
and
the
food
is
decent
,
but
I
find
it
overpriced
,
and
the
waits
too
long
for
the
quality
of
the
food

Classic
diner
feel
gives
it
a
slight
bump
,
but
really
,
I
think
it
's
an
average
place
,
with
average
food.This
diner
offers
an
unexpectedly
large
number
of
vegetarian
options
,
including
a
fantastic
``
Sheldon
''
sandwich
--
their
veggie
analog
to
the
Rueben
.
Fresh
hot
fries
would
have
nudged
this
rating
to
five
stars.Yeah
,
it
's
nice
there
are
a
lot
of
veggie
options
,
but
I
feel
like
they
are
spreading
themselves
too
thin
.
No
one
I
went
with
was
really
impressed
with
their
food
,
and
the
weird
thing
was
that
the
waitress
brought
out
half
the
table
's
food
,
making
a
few
people
wait
.
Anyone
who
's
been
a
waitress
knows
not
to
do
that
.
I
do
appreciate
tempeh
,
seitan
and
tofu
on
menus
,
but
it
would
be
nice
if
they
did
it
well.Having
heard
only
good
things
,
I
had
pretty
high
expectations
for
Monty
's
but
I
felt
let
down
by
the
service
and
really
let
down
by
the
food
.
The
meals
ordered
,
chicken
in
a
pie
and
salmon
cakes
were
both
luke-warm
and
tasted
like
they
had
lived
under
a
warming
lamp
for
quite
some
time
.
This
place
it
not
worth
the
reputation.There
are
definitely
hits
and
misses
at
Monty
's
.
As
a
pesco
vegetarian
,
I
appreciate
a
restaurant
where
I
have
more
than
3-5
options
The
hits
would
include
the
vegetarian
meatloaf
dinner
,
carrot
curry
soup
,
the
salmon
ceasar
salad
,
almost
all
of
their
baked
goods
,
and
almost
all
of
their
breakfast
items
.
The
misses
include
the
vegetarian
reuben
-LRB-
called
the
Sheldon
-RRB-
,
it
's
just
too
dry
.
Ditto
on
the
vegetarian
BLT
.
The
waits
at
weekend
brunch
and
lunch
time
are
long
.
At
times
,
I
have
experienced
legendary
slow
service
so
dine
with
only
people
you
can
stand
being
around
for
2
hours
or
more
.
Despite
the
negative
,
I
enjoy
it
,
and
I
take
people
who
are
new
to
Madison
here
,
and
they
love
it
too.Old
school
--
I
enjoyed
the
meatloaf
and
there
are
some
really
great
options
if
you
are
dining
with
a
vegetarian.Grade
;
C
-
I
do
n't
understand
why
people
make
such
a
big
deal
out
of
this
below-average
place
.

fools
Madison

Do
n't
believe
the

:
-
easy

-

-

-

-

Weaknesses
:
-
they
could
only
*
almost
*
find
the
gluten-free
menu
and
were
n't
sure
what
was
in
some
of
the
sauces
-
the
women
's
bathroom
was
about
120
degrees
and
stuffy
-
desert
options
looked
non-existent
for
the
gluten-free
crowd
,
though
I
did
n't
look
very
closely
It
was
still
a
fun
place
to
have
brunch
with
a
friend
,
even
if
I
ended
up
drinking
way
too
much
coffee
.
I
had
an
omelette
and
it
was
fairly
standard
.
Apparently
people
say
it
's
overpriced
for
Madison
,
though
since
I
live
in
San
Francisco
,
I
'm
not
really
one
to
say
.
I
would
have
happily
given
another
point
if
only
the
staff
could
have
found
the
gluten-free
menu.We
went
here
for
breakfast
on
a
Sunday
.
It
was
very
crowded
,
but
we
only
had
to
wait
20-30
minutes
.
I
'm
not
gon
na
lie
,
some
of
the
staff
seem
incompetent
,
but
they
are
nice
in
general
.
I
am
giving
it
3
because
:
-
Cool
,
old
style
,
but
generic
diner
interior
-
Reasonable
prices
-
Food
was
decent
-
Crowd
was
good
,
chill
-
there
were
a
good
number
of
veg
options
,
but
not
too
many
for
us
meat
eaters
-LRB-
yum
-RRB-
It
is
about
the
most
vegetarian-friendly
diner
I
've
ever
known
.
Some
things
on
the
menu
are
stellar
--
like
the
tofu
wrap
and
the
yummy
waffle
fries
--
and
others
are
so-so
.
Is
suppose
that
,
as
far
as
``
diner
''
food
goes
,
it
's
better
than
average
,
but
you
're
not
really
paying
``
diner
''
prices
...
The
staff
always
seems
sort
of
out
of
it
and
not
thrilled
to
interact
with
customers
.
We
regularly
wait
long
stretches
to
get
some
attention
from
our
server
once
we
are
sat
.
But
the
faked-up
old
diner
feels
groovy
and
you
always
leave
painfully
full.My
review
would
probably
be
higher
,
had
I
not
just
the
other
day
had
one
of
the
worst
meals
of
my
life
at
Monty
's
Blue
Plate
diner
.
My
meatloaf
sandwich
was
so
salty
is
almost
inedible
.
At
first
I
thought
it
was
the
gravy
that
had
the
excessive
salt
,
then
I
figured
it
was
the
meatloaf
.
After
plodding
through
this
sodium-induced
nightmare
I
realized
that
the
whole
damn
thing
was
pure
salt
,
like
that
one
episode
of
the
Original
Series
Star
Trek
,
the
one
with
the
salt
beast
,
that
's
made
of
pure
sodium
.
This
place
has
a
varied
menu
with
a
good
selection
of
vegan
or
vegetarian
dishes
.
I
would
recommend
the
Palomino
or
Comet
in
MIlwaukee
,
both
vegan
and
vegetarian
friendly
diners
,
over
this
place
any
day
of
the
week.Monty
's
is
basically
a
shiny
Denny
's
in
the
heart
of
Madison
's
Atwood
neighborhood
.
On
the
plus
side
,
you
wo
n't
leave
the
diner
with
an
empty
stomach
.
The
portions
are
generous
,
potatoes
seasoned
just
right
and
the
servers
keep
your
coffee
fresh
.
It
's
not
worth
waiting
more
than
30
minutes
to
sit
,
but
smaller
parties
of
2
to
3
can
get
in
relatively
fast
.
Decent
menu
selection
and
the
pies
look
good
by
the
counter
...
but
saving
room
for
pie
is
a
challenge.I
have
been
going
to
Monty
's
for
years
and
I
have
always
had
the
same
thing
to
say
:
the
service
sucks
.
The
food
is
okay
,
I
mean
,
it
's
a
diner
.
There
is
a
wide
variety
of
vegetarian
options
which
is
nice
.
I
also
have
to
mention
that
I
wo
n't
be
eating
here
again
soon
as
they
have
very
recently
taken
my
2
favorite
items
off
the
menu
;
the
tuna
steak
sandwich
,
and
the
cajun
chicken
sandwich
.
The
cumin
chipotle
mayonnaise
on
the
tuna
sandwich
was
one
of
the
only
reasons
I
would
even
still
go
to
Monty
's
.
The
service
is
always
terrible
.
you
can
count
on
a
long
wait
for
your
waiter
to
take
your
order
,
for
them
to
bring
your
drinks
,
and
your
food
,
and
the
longest
wait
of
all
is
always
for
the
check
.
I
have
contemplated
a
dine
and
dash
many
times
.
I
counted
the
minutes
one
time
,
and
it
was
45
minutes
from
the
time
I
finished
eating
to
when
the
check
came
.
It
was
n't
because
the
waitress
did
n't
see
me
from
behind
the
counter
either
,
she
was
talking
to
another
server
.
Once
,
I
was
eating
with
a
friend
,
and
we
were
waiting
for
15
minutes
to
even
have
our
waiter
come
to
the
table
,
so
we
just
left
.
Believe
me
,
the
service
being
slow
is
never
because
there
is
n't
enough
servers
or
too
many
diners
.
The
food
is
decent
,
but
it
's
not
great
by
any
means
.
It
is
still
pretty
okay
,
although
I
've
had
some
bad
meals
.
The
meatless
meatloaf
is
only
saved
by
the
cashew
gravy
,
and
the
salmon
cakes
are
awful
.
The
tuna
sandwich
was
really
good
,
but
the
size
and
bun
has
changed
over
the
years
,
and
recently
been
replaced
by
3
kinds
of
pastrami
sandwiches
.
The
grilled
chicken
salad
is
good
,
as
is
the
feta
dill
burger.I
've
never
been
even
remotely
let
down
by
Monty
's
.
Is
it
busy
a
lot
?
Yes
.
Are
you
probably
going
to
have
to
wait
30
minutes
to
sit
down
?
Yes
.
Is
the
service
slow
because
it
's
so
busy
?
Yes
.
I
've
never
been
under
the
impression
that
the
service
is
slow
because
they
're
incompetent
,
but
just
because
they
're
busy
.
Besides
that
,
I
've
never
noticed
it
being
*
especially
*
slow
...
just
kind
of
slow
,
which
does
n't
really
bother
me
.
Let
me
take
a
moment
here
to
recommend
the
Meatloaf
Sandwich
:
Get
it
served
cold
.
Just
trust
me
here
.
Do
not
get
it
hot
.
I
've
had
it
served
both
ways
:
Cold
,
it
is
a
sandwich
so
delicious
that
fireworks
go
off
in
your
head
;
Warm
,
it
is
an
open-faced
abomination
with
gravy
and
mashed
potatoes
poured
all
over
it
.
Their
cheeseburger
was
surprisingly
good
-LRB-
I
'd
even
go
so
far
to
say
that
it
's
one
of
the
best
burgers
I
've
had
in
Madison
-RRB-
.
They
had
a
special
entree
one
evening
,
``
Cheeseburger
Mac
&
Cheese
,
''
which
was
out
of
this
world
.
It
really
tasted
like
a
cheeseburger
over
noodles
!
They
serve
a
great
chef
salad
,
have
awesome
spicy
waffle
fries
,
and
I
would
die
100
times
over
for
the
buttermilk
biscuits
they
serve
with
breakfast
.
Their
expansive
dessert
case
is
as
tasty
as
it
is
impressive
looking
.
I
was
beyond
sold
on
this
place
one
time
when
I
ordered
a
piece
of
german
chocolate
cake
for
dessert
.
It
was
n't
a
piece
so
much
as
it
was
a
towering
slab
.
It
was
so
tall
,
in
fact
,
that
it
was
n't
until
I
'd
eaten
enough
of
it
that
I
noticed
that
the
waiter
-LRB-
who
was
wearing
a
mohawk
and
kilt
-RRB-
had
written
,
``
Das
ist
Deutsch
''
in
chocolate
on
the
plate
.
I
've
had
questionable
service
twice
:
Once
was
when
I
reserved
a
pie
for
a
dinner
I
was
going
to
and
they
did
not
have
it
when
I
got
there
,
but
tried
to
placate
me
by
selling
me
a
larger
,
more
expensive
pie
.
That
was
after
I
approached
the
counter
and
saw
several
staff
members
stare
at
me
for
20
minutes
before
I
was
finally
helped
.
The
other
time
was
when
I
was
there
for
coffee
and
dessert
with
friends
,
and
we
paid
with
a
card
.
The
waiter
told
us
,
upon
picking
up
the
card
,
``
You
know
,
if
you
can
,
you
should
really
give
me
my
tip
in
cash
.
We
do
n't
see
it
on
our
paychecks
for
another
2
weeks
otherwise
.
''
Um
...
thanks
for
the
advice
on
how
we
should
tip
you
.
How
about
we
do
n't
tip
you
at
all
?
But
those
two
experiences
aside
,
nothing
has
been
able
to
lessen
my
love
of
Monty
's
and
all
its
glory.Monty
's
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
places
on
the
near-east
side
.
I
've
long
loved
their
Meatloaf
of
the
Gods
,
fat
and
calories
be
damned
.
However
,
our
last
5-6
experiences
have
been
exercises
in
frustration
,
with
such
charming
features
as
a
$
100
overcharge
on
my
debit
card
for
a
$
23
meal
.
-LRB-
yes
,
you
read
that
right
-RRB-
.
Yes
,
the
server
was
new
,
yes
they
corrected
it
,
but
still
.
We
ate
there
again
last
night
-
I
'm
a
firm
believer
in
the
power
of
the
19th
chance
-
,
only
to
leave
with
a
renewed
resolve
that
there
are
many
better
options
available.What
a
cute
little
place
.
Does
n't
seem
like
the
smoothest
run
location
.
The
food
we
were
served
was
good
and
served
as
requested
...
they
serve
breakfast
all
day
,
which
is
really
nice
.
I
thought
the
food
was
well
priced
and
the
service
was
efficient.I
had
just
moved
from
Colorado
,
back
here
,
to
the
midwest
.
So
of
course
,
I
ordered
the
meatloaf
.
I
told
the
server
that
it
was
better
than
my
mom
's
,
and
that
's
no
hyperbole
--
it
's
DAMN
good
!
I
will
most
certainly
be
coming
back.I
've
been
in
Madison
for
10
days
or
so
and
I
've
made
this
observation
:
Madison
residents
are
spoiled
rotten
!
ROTTEN
!
There
is
nothing
like
Monty
's
back
home
in
Boston
.
I
dare
all
you
haters
visit
its
counterpart
in
Boston
,
the
South
Street
Diner
.
Have
a
meal
there
and
report
back
to
me
.
I
will
have
a
hankie
ready
to
wipe
away
your
tears
of
disappointment
.
At
Monty
's
today
,
I
accidentally
dumped
sugar
all
over
my
french
fries
.
Even
though
I
'm
clearly
a
stupid
klutz
,
they
gave
me
new
fries
anyway
.
My
chocolate
malt
was
perfect
.
Once
I
slurped
it
all
up
,
I
felt
a
little
sad
...
and
then
I
discovered
there
was
ANOTHER
malt
waiting
for
me
and
I
felt
like
a
winner
!
And
believe
it
or
not
,
I
'm
a
connoisseur
of
vegetarian
reubens
.
I
've
tried
them
all
over
the
country
in
CA
,
RI
,
MA
,
CT
,
NY
and
Monty
's
in
the
best
I
've
ever
had.The
food
can
be
good
here
-LRB-
not
great
but
good
-RRB-
but
the
biggest
problem
for
me
is
the
AWFUL
service
.
Somebody
teach
these
people
some
customer
service
.
I
swear
that
the
guy
who
waited
on
me
the
last
time
I
was
there
was
high
.
The
interminable
waiting
for
refills
on
drinks
and
the
check
drove
my
blood
pressure
through
the
roof
.
I
've
determined
that
the
secret
to
getting
good
service
from
anyone
here
is
to
be
a
hot
looking
college
girl
...
that
seemed
to
keep
the
waiter
's
attention
focused
on
the
table
next
to
mine
...
Maybe
she
was
one
of
the
more
positive
posters
here.We
dont
live
on
that
side
of
town
any
more
but
when
we
do
go
there
on
a
Sunday
,
we
like
to
stop
there
for
lunch
.
And
few
times
this
summer
even
with
gas
price
,
we
drove
there
for
lunch
.
You
cant
leave
there
without
trying
one
of
their
pies
or
cakes
.
Usually
,
I
wont
have
room
after
the
regular
food
so
I
end
up
taking
home
the
pie
.
Never
been
there
without
having
to
wait
for
20
minute
or
so
.
But
it
's
all
worth
the
wait
.
I
just
wish
they
make
the
place
just
a
little
bigger
or
do
soemthing
about
the
noise
level
.
I
'm
a
meat
eatter
but
I
tried
their
bean
burger
there
and
now
that
's
all
I
eat
there
.
Besides
the
dessert.Breakfast
places
are
generally
my
favorite
types
of
places
to
dive
into
in
new
cities
simply
because
breakfast
is
my
favorite
meal
of
the
day
.
I
'd
never
been
to
Madison
before
and
I
must
say
it
's
a
lovely
city
.
Of
course
we
were
there
in
late
May
when
the
temperature
was
a
balmy
67
with
nice
breezes
throughout
.
Monty
's
was
good
,
very
good
,
in
fact
.
So
good
that
we
went
there
2
days
in
a
row
.
We
were
traveling
with
some
vegetarians
and
they
were
able
to
find
tasty
eats
on
the
menu
as
well
.
There
was
disappointment
in
their
version
of
eggs
benedict
which
had
a
mornay-type
sauce
that
really
tasted
burnt
.
Like
burnt
crap
,
actually
.
Maybe
I
just
do
n't
like
mornay
sauce
but
ugh
.
Coffee
was
good
,
we
tried
some
of
their
desserts
and
enjoyed
the
diner
atmosphere
from
our
cozy
booth
.
Well
done
,
Madison
,
well
done.I
love
the
vegetarian
Rueben
and
stuffed
myself
with
the
potato
pie
,
but
I
have
n't
been
thrilled
with
my
breakfast
experiences
here
.
I
had
the
Scrambled
Something
or
Other
on
the
day
that
it
happened
to
have
asparagus
in
it
.
I
never
did
find
any
asparagus
,
but
the
eggs
turned
a
horrendous
shade
of
gray
.
The
potatoes
were
hardly
cooked
all
the
way
through
,
but
at
least
the
biscuit
was
good
.
I
'm
convinced
the
Mornay
sauce
is
sausage
gravy
-
I
used
to
live
in
France
and
never
had
Mornay
sauce
like
the
stuff
at
Monty
's
!
Still
-
I
give
the
place
props
for
having
so
many
vegetarian
options
.
It
's
fun
to
go
out
and
have
more
to
choose
from
than
an
iceberg
lettuce
salad
or
grilled
cheese.I
was
in
Madison
overnight
and
ate
at
Monty
's
not
once
but
twice
.
The
vegetarian
food
was
that
good
.
Madison
does
not
seem
to
have
much
in
the
way
of
vegetarian
restaurants
.
Monty
's
was
at
the
top
of
the
list
when
I
did
my
research
.
But
the
vegetarian
menu
at
Monty
's
is
pretty
hard
to
beat
,
especially
for
a
place
that
caters
to
carnivores
as
well
-LRB-
unusual
-RRB-
.
About
half
of
the
menu
is
vegetarian-friendly
,
with
a
couple
of
vegan
items
as
well
.
The
veggie
meatloaf
was
the
best
of
the
food
we
ate
-LRB-
not
including
the
pie
-RRB-
,
but
the
tempeh
in
the
veggie
BLT
was
nicely
prepared
too
.
We
did
n't
try
breakfast
items
,
but
tofu
scrambler
was
available
and
looked
great
.
The
food
was
delicious
,
the
desserts
were
enormous
and
divine
,
and
we
thought
the
service
was
fast
and
friendly
.
We
were
there
on
a
Sunday
evening
and
a
Monday
lunch
,
and
neither
time
did
we
wait
for
a
table
.
I
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
's
looking
for
a
restaurant
for
both
the
carnivores
and
the
herbivores
,
while
satisfying
both
groups
.
That
's
not
easy
to
do
,
and
Monty
's
did
it
well.This
is
my
absolute
favorite
restaurant
and
anytime
I
come
home
for
a
visit
I
have
to
stop
by
to
have
some
Meatless
Loaf
of
the
God
's
or
a
Gobbler
!
Top
it
all
off
with
a
Cup
of
Mud
or
an
off
the
hook
slice
of
pie
or
cake
and
you
have
one
amazing
meal
that
can
only
be
found
in
Mad-town
.
Yummy
,
yummy
,
yummy
!
Has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
diners
in
Mad-town
.
Delicious
veggie
chili
,
spicy
cornbread
,
malts
and
desserts
,
as
well
as
the
amazing
array
of
other
veggie
options
.
Just
yesterday
,
I
tried
the
new
Spinoccoli
Quiche
with
fruit
,
which
was
pretty
darn
good
...
coffee
is
always
hot
and
refills
frequent
.
Still
have
yet
to
try
the
famous
zucchini
pancakes
,
but
next
time
,
I
must
.
I
must
also
remember
to
save
room
for
dessert
!
Look
forward
to
returning
sooner
than
later
to
try
some
of
the
other
new
lunch
options
on
the
menu
.
Only
downer
is
the
wait/lack
of
parking
on
a
busy
day
.
Overall
,
two
thumbs
up
from
me
,
Monty.I
liked
the
1950s-diner
ambience
of
this
joint
.
It
was
crowded
and
bustling
when
we
went
,
though
we
did
n't
have
to
wait
for
a
table
,
unlike
people
in
larger
groups
.
It
seems
to
be
a
popular
weekend
brunch
spot
.
The
service
was
friendly
and
prompt
and
our
waiter
picked
up
that
I
was
vegan
-LRB-
without
me
telling
him
-RRB-
and
helpfully
told
us
that
some
things
-LRB-
such
as
the
rolls
-RRB-
were
n't
dairy-free
.
He
substituted
toast
and
English
muffins
for
us
.
I
found
my
vegan
tofu
scramble
with
potato
hash
to
be
decent
,
but
nothing
spectacular
.
My
friend
thought
the
same
of
his
``
Sloppy
Faux
''
sandwich
which
came
with
waffle
fries
.
The
prices
are
reasonable
at
around
$
7-10
a
dish
and
the
portion
sizes
are
good
.
They
do
offer
at
least
eight
or
nine
vegan-friendly
dishes
from
scrambles
to
burgers
to
meatloaf
.
Madison
needs
a
place
like
this
which
offers
vegan
brunch
foods
so
I
appreciate
Blue
Plate
is
around
.
The
vibe
is
good
and
they
have
parking
.
But
the
quality
of
the
food
could
stand
to
improve
a
bit.Fun
place
!
Very
hip!Dear
Monty
's
,
I
miss
you
so
,
so
much
out
here
in
Boston
.
We
've
had
quite
the
long-term
relationship
:
from
late-night
pie
after
high
school
dances
,
to
my
stint
as
a
busgirl/counter
in
the
ever-important
Sunday
brunch
rush
,
your
old
blue
tshirts
with
``
World
's
Best
Coffee
''
on
the
back
,
to
dinner
before
a
show
at
the
Barrymore
,
to
my
going
back
each
time
I
'm
in
town
to
run
into
familiar
faces
.
For
years
,
Tim
and
Roma
and
a
large
posse
have
made
this
tiny
former
gas
station
a
stalwart
in
the
Madison
dining
scene
.
Monty
's
,
you
and
the
Barrymore
have
rejuvenated
Atwood
Ave.
You
,
and
your
vegetarian
comfort
food
,
zucchini-potato
pancakes
,
scrambled
something-or-other
,
andes
mint
cheesecake
,
chocolate
malts
-LRB-
do
n't
ask
how
much
ice
cream
goes
into
those
,
btw
.
but
it
's
all
from
the
Chocolate
Shoppe
-RRB-
,
muffins
,
pumpkin
bars
.
I
could
go
on
and
on
.
And
how
.
For
all
of
you
lucky
enough
to
reside
around
this
place
,
please
take
advantage
.
There
's
nothing
like
it
anywhere
else
.
Sincerely
,
AngelinaMonty
's
is
awesome
.
Their
vegetarian
comfort
food
is
great
and
there
are
lots
of
choices
.
Get
the
spicy
waffle
fries
with
your
sandwich
;
they
are
not
actually
spicy
,
but
they
're
delicious
.
I
also
love
the
milkshakes!I
live
down
the
road
from
Monty
's
and
it
's
being
in
walking
distance
helps
give
it
a
half
a
star
.
I
also
tend
to
go
at
off-peak
times
which
I
think
has
helped
me
have
a
better
experience
-LRB-
mid
mornings
on
the
weekends
can
get
very
crowded
and
you
'll
have
a
wait
-RRB-
.
I
've
tried
many
things
here
and
have
never
had
anything
bad
.
Some
things
though
were
just
meh
.
I
really
enjoyed
their
french
toast
.
It
was
big
and
fluffy
on
the
inside
and
cooked
just
right
on
the
outside
.
Their
omelets
and
other
egg
dishes
I
've
tried
were
pretty
standard
.
The
serving
sizes
are
pretty
big
.
I
'm
not
a
veg
,
but
I
appreciate
that
they
had
several
options
available
for
those
who
are
.
Overall
I
think
it
's
a
fun
place
to
take
friends
who
are
visiting
from
out
of
town
before
heading
down
to
the
farmer
's
market
early
on
a
Saturday
morning.I
came
here
for
brunch
on
a
saturday
.
I
got
the
GLBT
:
Guacamole
,
lettuce
,
bacon
and
tomato
.
It
was
delicious
!
I
love
that
this
place
serves
Sprecher
root
beer
.
Seems
like
that
's
a
standard
for
Madison
,
but
I
love
it
and
I
'm
thrilled
whenever
I
can
order
it
.
Yum
!
We
also
got
one
of
their
delicious
pies
to
go
,
and
it
was
killer
.
So
even
if
you
're
full
after
breakfast
or
lunch
,
grab
one
of
the
desserts
to
go
for
later
enjoyment
.
I
thought
service
was
good
here
;
we
got
our
food
in
a
decent
amount
of
time
.
Be
warned
,
it
can
be
hard
to
get
to
via
car
,
since
the
street
arrangement
in
that
area
is
totally
wacky
.
However
,
it
's
worth
the
hunt
,
since
you
get
Monty
's
at
the
end
.
Now
that
the
weather
is
nice
,
check
out
the
botanical
gardens
afterwards
,
since
it
's
close
to
this
restaurant.Another
one
of
my
weekend
staples
.
Monty
's
is
the
best
diner
in
Madison
--
mainly
because
of
their
great
vegetarian
selection
-LRB-
they
have
a
whole
vegetarian
SECTION
...
a
relieving
site
for
hungry
vegetarian
eyes
.
-RRB-
My
carnivorous
friend
are
big
fans
of
Monty
's
as
well
,
so
it
's
not
for
vegetarians
only
.
I
like
their
overall
ambiance
and
their
waitstaff
is
good
if
not
great
.
The
deserts
are
a
MUST
.
Their
shakes
are
really
something
to
drool
over
,
and
their
pies
and
cakes
are
delicious
as
well
.
Oh
,
and
scrumptious
breakfasts!Last
time
I
was
there
we
had
a
table
for
four
people
.
We
ordered
:
one
Reuben
,
one
Sheldon
-LRB-
Reuben
's
vegetarian
cousin
-RRB-
as
is
,
two
vegan
Sheldons
.
What
can
I
say
,
my
friends
and
I
like
kraut
.
But
yeah
.
The
Sheldon
can
be
made
vegan
,
and
even
without
cheese
-LRB-
gasp
-RRB-
it
's
really
delicious
.
Someone
else
mentioned
that
it
was
dry
,
but
I
order
this
almost
every
time
and
am
never
disappointed
.
The
fries
are
awesome
.
Good
-LRB-
but
expensive
-RRB-
Bloody
Marys
.
They
have
vegan
pie
slices
and
can
make
VEGAN
MILKSHAKES
.
:
-RRB-
I
am
a
vegetarian
and
this
is
the
only
place
i
can
get
good
comfort
food
!
Me
and
the
bf
started
with
the
oreo
shake
.
We
ordered
one
but
they
were
nice
enough
to
split
it
for
us
...
and
we
did
n't
ask
...
bonus
points
there
.
I
ordered
the
meatless
meatloaf
sandwich
,
which
was
served
open
face
with
mashed
potatoes
and
cashew
gravy
...
It
was
weird
looking
but
so
so
so
delicious
.
Made
of
carrots
and
cheese
and
other
goodness
the
whole
plate
was
fabulous
!
BF
got
the
TNT
BLT
...
he
was
not
a
fan
but
I
loved
that
too
...
just
a
basic
veg
blt
,
with
the
spicy
waffle
fries
.
I
do
not
like
their
ranch
dressing
though
...
it
's
like
the
generic
brand
.
For
dessert
we
got
some
of
the
carrot
cake
and
raspberry
cheesecake
to
go
...
I
will
from
now
on
always
get
dessert
,
it
was
the
best
part
!!!
Next
time
I
am
trying
the
FAt
Elvis
Cake
!!!
**
update
.
***
Tried
the
Fat
Elvis
Cake
...
AMAZING
!
Banana
bread-cake
layered
with
peanut
butter
frosting
topped
with
chocolate
frosting
...
Will
definately
get
this
again!Can
'
t
do
animals
,
ca
n't
do
dairy
,
yet
am
a
food
warrior
.
Indeed
,
Madison
abounds
with
options
for
a
gal
like
me
,
but
Monty
's
marks
my
favorite
eatery
in
the
city
.
Intentionally
old-school
in
its
decor
and
prices
,
it
's
a
throwback
that
appeals
to
anyone
with
a
frontal
cortex
.
My
waitress
brought
me
a
gratis
cup
of
the
home-made
veg
soup
as
I
was
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
counter
an
she
had
n't
seen
me
for
a
few
minutes
-LRB-
aaaaand
the
tip
started
to
go
up
-RRB-
.
I
had
the
meatless
meatloaf
thing
also
mentioned
here
,
and
good
LORD
the
portion
size
was
outta
control
.
The
roll
was
the
size
of
a
Yorkshire
pudding
and
the
mashed
potatoes
were
actually
made
of
potato
,
fancy
that
.
The
meatless
loaf
itself
was
solidly
good
-LRB-
shredded
root
veg
with
a
cheesy
binder
-
wish
I
had
known
that
prior
to
ordering
,
but
should
've
asked
-RRB-
but
a
bit
oily
and
the
cashew
gravy
was
goooood
.
So
many
great-looking
options
for
veg-heads
like
myself
,
hallelujah
a-MEN
,
and
they
even
have
a
small
wine
list
and
beer
.
I
could
n't
get
through
the
entire
pile
of
food
,
despite
being
a
hormonal
food
warrior
that
day
,
yet
I
craved
a
sweet
and
Monty
's
has
soy
ice
cream
.
WTF
,
OTHER
DINERS
?
I
nearly
wept
at
this
one
.
I
had
the
mint
chip
,
2
scoops
,
which
again
were
more
like
two
grapefruit
spilling
over
the
sides
of
the
bowl
.
That
,
I
could
do
.
My
total
bill
came
to
$
8
.
EIGHT
.
I
added
a
50
%
tip
and
blew
Monty
's
a
kiss
as
I
left
;
I
shall
RETURN
!
Waitress
was
a
sweetie
,
the
staff
all
seemed
to
be
pretty
happy
,
and
the
place
was
approaching
fullness
when
I
left
.
My
fondness
for
Monty
's
justifies
the
caps.This
is
a
diner
and
should
be
treated
as
such
-
the
service
is
hit-or-miss
,
the
atmosphere
is
n't
anything
special
,
and
everything
on
the
menu
is
pretty
good
.
A
few
tips
for
enjoying
all
this
place
has
to
offer
:
1
.
Share
a
malt
or
shake
with
someone
-
they
are
delicious
and
HUGE
,
so
way
too
much
to
eat
with
the
well-portioned
meals
,
but
half
of
one
is
perfect
and
satisfying
.
2
.
Find
something
that
you
like
on
the
menu
and
stick
with
it
-
there
are
a
number
of
exceptional
things
on
the
menu
-LRB-
i.e.
the
Meatless
Meatloaf
-RRB-
,
but
everything
else
is
average
.
I
'd
probably
give
this
3
stars
,
but
the
amount
of
vegetarian
options
is
fantastic
and
deserves
another
star.I
would
n't
eat
here
for
breakfast
unless
you
like
poached
eggs
that
are
hard
cooked
or
a
soggy
english
muffin
.
Something
so
frighteningly
easy
to
make
-LRB-
the
Mediterranean
:
toasted
english
muffin
,
veggie
medley
,
poached
eggs
-RRB-
turned
out
terribly
wrong
.
Makes
me
wonder
how
the
basics
escaped
them
this
morning
...
Except
when
it
comes
to
the
pies
.
Pie
pie
pie
!
coffee
,
pie
,
dessert
,
pie
,
bakery
,
cakes
,
yummy
,
beautiful
...
pie
!
Catch
my
drift?After
seeing
old
friends
at
the
last
Latin
Night
at
The
Cardinal
-LRB-
http://www.yelp.com/biz/cardinal-bar-madison#hrid:KfYiEWXAc-SlP_qEiUO6Hw
-RRB-
we
agreed
to
meet
here
for
breakfast
on
Monday
morning
.
Well
,
not
all
of
us
made
it
but
good
times
were
had
while
eating
.
This
is
the
closest
to
a
`
real
'
diner
that
Madison
has
that
I
've
been
to
but
they
have
some
truly
kick
ass
pieces
of
fat
French
Toast
.
I
had
bacon
&
eggs
,
french
toast
w
/
coffe
&
cream
and
my
daughter
had
the
Blue
Plate
Omelette
w
/
home
fries
and
orange
juice
.
Good
place
to
come
with
a
group
of
old
friends
or
your
kids
-LRB-
if
they
know
how
to
act
right
in
public
...
-RRB-
Monty
's
offers
many
vegetarian
options
.
For
example
,
they
offer
the
Reuben
sandwich
for
meat
eaters
and
the
Sheldon
for
vegetarians
.
I
am
consistently
disappointed
when
I
visit
Monty
's
.
On
the
last
visit
,
I
my
fries
were
cold
and
my
glass
was
dirty
and
cracked
.
A
companion
ordered
a
plain
cheeseburger
and
it
was
loaded
with
onions
.
The
carrot
cake
was
obviously
old
--
the
cake
was
dried
and
the
frosting
was
crusty
.
Another
companion
got
the
German
chocolate
cake
which
was
also
dry
.
It
's
a
cool
place
,
but
needs
better
food.My
impression
of
Monty
's
is
very
conflicting
.
On
one
hand
,
I
want
to
say
Monty
's
is
an
awesome
place
with
great
food
.
On
the
other
hand
I
want
to
say
Monty
's
is
overrated
.
Let
me
explain
.
I
love
Monty
's
because
of
the
options
.
If
you
are
a
vegetarian
or
vegan
you
are
n't
confined
to
the
world
of
salads
.
There
are
many
delicious
and
satisfying
options
.
If
you
do
n't
restrict
your
diet
in
any
way
,
there
are
many
great
meaty
and
chalorically
rich
options
for
you
too
.
Watching
carbs
?
Get
a
sandwich
in
a
wrap
.
Looking
for
a
healthy
lean
meat
option
?
Choose
one
of
the
several
good
chicken
dishes
.
I
personally
steer
towards
the
lean
meat
or
veggie
dishes
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.
It
's
really
hard
to
find
a
restaurant
that
caters
to
my
needs
as
well
as
my
boyfriend
's
nonrestrictive
diet
needs
.
This
place
does
it
well
and
at
a
pretty
decent
price
.
Though
,
I
do
n't
personally
think
Monty
's
is
overrated
,
I
feel
that
the
point
needs
to
be
made
.
Whatever
you
order
will
be
fresh
and
pretty
tasty
.
However
,
say
you
order
The
Meatloaf
of
the
Gods
,
it
may
not
be
what
you
expect
if
you
are
the
type
of
person
that
is
looking
for
traditional
`
the-way-mom-made-it
'
meatloaf
slathered
with
ketchup
.
If
you
are
looking
for
an
extensive
breakfast
menu
consisting
of
traditional
American
breakfast
combos
-LRB-
i.e.
-
a
dish
that
contains
ALL
of
the
following
:
pancakes
,
eggs
,
hash
browns
,
3
kinds
of
meat
and
toast
-RRB-
,
Denny
's
or
Perkin
's
may
be
a
better
option
for
you
.
They
put
their
own
spin
on
the
more
traditional
dishes
and
have
created
an
awesome
list
of
in-house
specialties
.
Whether
you
eat
meat
or
not
you
MUST
try
The
Meatless
Meatloaf
of
the
Gods
.
It
's
amazing
.
Like
your
beef
?
Definitely
try
the
Blueplate
Burger
!
Do
n't
like
beef
so
much
but
still
want
a
burger
?
Try
the
Blueplate
Burger
with
a
locally
made
walnut
burger
.
No
matter
who
you
are
,
Monty
's
is
worth
a
try.Monty
's
is
a
great
diner-esque
restaurant
.
I
could
n't
even
imagine
counting
all
the
times
I
've
been
here
in
all
my
years
in
Madison
.
Hungover
,
bright
eyed
and
bushy
tailed
,
ready
for
bed
,
and
otherwise
.
Want
breakfast
?
Go
to
Monty
's
.
Lunch
?
Monty
's
.
Dinner
?
You
guessed
it
,
Monty
's
.
The
food
is
consistently
good
.
The
cook
will
often
come
out
to
the
tables
and
joke
with
the
customers
which
is
pretty
refreshing
.
If
you
're
looking
for
weekend
breakfast
,
there
may
be
a
line
,
but
at
least
you
can
sip
coffee
while
you
wait
.
Good
coffee
,
at
that
!
Monty
's
will
always
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
.
Oh
!
And
lots
of
vegetarian
options
,
also.Maybe
I
got
the
wrong
thing
,
but
I
'm
thinking
these
Madison
institutions
thrive
on
folks
who
would
rave
about
a
can
of
Spaghettios
if
it
was
served
as
an
original
dish
and
was
priced
at
$
8.95
...
because
that
was
my
experience
with
a
turkey
club
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
what
it
tasted
like
,
because
all
I
could
taste
was
the
french
roll
it
came
on
.
Why
you
ask
?
Because
it
had
once
slice
-LRB-
yes
folks
-
ONE
slice
of
turkey
-RRB-
,
two
slices
of
bacon
,
some
tomato
,
and
lettuce
.
I
really
paid
nearely
9
bucks
for
a
sandwich
with
one
slice
of
turkey
?
Are
east
siders
so
beholden
to
their
institutions
that
they
are
afraid
to
be
critical
of
poor
value
,
and
sub
par
food
?
Service
was
service
...
nothing
memorable
,
but
then
again
I
'm
not
expecting
expert
service
at
a
place
that
serves
soda
in
a
plastic
cup
.
Sorry
if
I
sound
bitter
,
but
I
'm
really
starting
to
get
irritated
w
/
all
this
Madison
dining
nonsense
.
I
have
yet
to
be
really
thrilled
by
what
I
eat
.
Oh
,
and
who
toasts
a
hot
dog
bun
?
Cooking
school
101
will
tell
you
the
bun
will
fall
apart.The
only
reason
I
did
n't
give
it
5
stars
is
because
there
is
ALWAYS
a
wait
,
but
what
can
you
do
.
The
food
is
delicious
.
Once
you
get
a
table
,
enjoy!Monty
's
Blue
Plate
Diner
is
one
of
those
funny
contradictions-in-terms
that
is
a
restaurant
which
is
both
good
but
overrated
.
Overall
,
though
,
it
is
far
and
away
my
favorite
Food
Fight
place
and
a
fairly
reliable
spot
to
get
a
good
meal
.
Monty
's
food
is
better
than
hit-or-miss
but
not
quite
consistently
good
.
Most
of
the
things
I
've
eaten
there
,
especially
the
breakfast
foods
,
have
been
delicious
-LRB-
and
huge
-RRB-
,
but
I
've
had
a
couple
of
very
sub-par
meals
-LRB-
one
was
so
bad
I
literally
could
not
eat
more
than
a
couple
of
bites
-RRB-
.
The
things
that
I
ate
and
disliked
are
now
off
the
menu
,
so
that
does
say
something
for
their
ability
to
identify
what
's
working
and
what
is
n't
.
What
I
can
say
is
that
the
egg-based
breakfast-y
menu
items
are
almost
universally
good
.
The
``
scrambled
something-or-other
''
never
fails
to
disappoint
,
nor
does
the
newer
Blue
Plate
Omelet
-LRB-
the
one
with
cheddar
,
avocado
and
bacon
...
good
lord
!
-RRB-
.
And
the
breakfast
burrito
is
especially
good
,
even
without
chorizo
-LRB-
which
is
how
I
usually
order
it
-RRB-
.
As
for
the
breakfast
side
items
,
the
potatoes
are
just
okay
;
the
biscuits
are
great
.
Most
importantly
of
all
,
the
coffee
is
superb
-LRB-
even
my
mother
thinks
so
and
she
drinks
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
coffee
than
I
do
-RRB-
.
Unfortunately
,
I
tend
to
shy
away
from
the
lunch
and
dinner
items
so
I
ca
n't
really
speak
to
their
quality
.
The
pies
,
though
,
are
heaven
.
And
it
's
certainly
worth
noting
that
the
menu
pays
special
attention
to
including
veg
*
n
options
.
The
atmosphere
is
pretty
awesome
.
Outdoor
seating
is
spacious
and
comfy
.
Indoors
,
the
blue-topped
tables
are
fun
for
making
patterns
with
the
wet
bottom
of
your
water
glass
.
Get
a
booth
if
you
can
;
the
tables
are
a
bit
cramped
.
The
waitstaff
are
generally
friendly
and
attentive
.
The
upshot
is
that
if
you
think
you
'll
enjoy
eating
at
a
diner
that
's
70
%
greasy
spoon
and
30
%
hipster
hot
spot
,
and
if
you
like
breakfast
foods
and
are
a
``
good
orderer
''
-LRB-
you
choose
from
menus
wisely
-RRB-
,
Monty
's
is
an
excellent
choice.Corned
beef
hash
,
please
marry
me
.
You
come
with
eggs
,
fruit
,
and
a
delicious
biscuit
.
You
are
potatoey
and
oniony
and
wonderful
.
Coconut
cream
pie
,
you
make
my
booty
more
bootylicious
.
Mmm.Awesome
breakfast
!!!
Had
the
``
something
or
other
scramble
''
and
it
was
amazing
,
kinda
like
an
omelette
that
is
scrambled
but
with
more
cheese
!
Breakfast
also
comes
with
a
super
fluffy
,
light
biscuit
and
some
sliced
,
browned
potatoes
.
Delicious
,
absolutely
delicious
.
Plus
the
waiter
took
pity
on
us
being
so
hungover
and
gave
me
some
aspirin
,
so
he
automatically
ranks
high
in
my
book
.
The
cupcakes
are
a
must
have
as
well
.
I
tried
the
Fat
Elvis
and
was
amazed
;
banana
cake
stuffed
full
of
peanut
butter
and
frosted
with
plenty
of
chocolate
!
Now
i
see
why
everyone
loves
the
bakery
here.I
like
this
place
because
they
have
so
many
vegetarian
options
.
I
loved
the
vege
BLT
with
strips
of
tempeh
yummy
:-RRB-
I
love
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
as
well
.
I
do
think
their
prices
are
kind
of
high
,
but
the
food
hits
the
spot!Monty
's
goes
back
a
very
long
time
in
Madison
and
is
a
great
place
to
get
a
home-cooked
style
meal
.
I
used
to
go
with
my
parents
as
a
kid
,
and
now
as
an
adult
I
've
started
to
rediscover
how
much
I
loved
their
food
.
Nestled
in
the
eclectic
Atwood
Ave
neighborhood
,
Monty
's
presents
a
50
's
style
diner
with
yummy
lunch
specials
like
meatloaf
-LRB-
very
good
meatloaf
-RRB-
,
sandwiches
,
and
a
wicked
good
brunch
.
They
also
have
ridiculously
delicious
chocolate
shakes
,
so
do
n't
be
afraid
to
splurge
while
you
're
there
.
One
of
the
other
great
things
about
Monty
's
is
the
atmosphere
;
the
area
around
it
is
filled
with
little
mom
and
pop
shops
,
the
Barrymore
theater
,
and
relics
of
an
older
time
.
Take
a
stroll
around
if
it
's
a
nice
day
and
your
bound
to
find
something
you
like
.
If
not
,
I
'm
sure
you
probably
enjoyed
the
food
as
all
the
dishes
I
've
ever
had
were
great
and
the
portions
were
generous
.
There
are
a
few
drawbacks
though
that
held
me
back
from
giving
a
5
star
review
.
First
,
there
is
usually
a
very
long
wait
.
The
place
is
popular
,
but
I
do
n't
feel
that
the
food
and
eastside
location
-LRB-
I
live
far
westside
-RRB-
always
justifies
the
overall
experience
.
Secondly
,
the
service
is
hit
or
miss
.
I
've
had
some
waitresses
who
were
prompt
and
polite
,
making
me
feel
right
at
home
,
and
others
who
were
sarcastically
rude
to
the
point
where
people
in
my
party
almost
had
to
say
something
.
Furthermore
,
the
kitchen
does
n't
always
look
clean
,
as
trays
of
biscuits
have
been
left
sitting
out
and
flies
have
been
a
buzzing
.
Setting
all
those
things
aside
though
-LRB-
which
I
know
may
be
hard
for
some
-RRB-
,
the
blue
plate
is
a
Madison
delight
that
should
not
be
missed
.
The
food
is
so
good
you
'll
be
stuffed
in
a
recliner
when
you
get
home
pining
for
more.We
went
here
over
the
summer
and
I
still
dream
about
the
biscuit
that
comes
with
the
breakfasts
.
The
wait
for
brunch
was
long
,
but
the
free
papers
and
indoor/outdoor
waiting
area
made
it
entirely
bearable
.
The
menu
,
as
others
have
mentioned
,
is
very
very
vegetarian
friendly
.
We
tried
the
pesto
+
mushroom
omelet
,
which
was
original
and
delicious
,
as
was
the
spinach
+
feta
omelet
.
We
also
tried
a
recommended
milk
shake
,
which
was
worth
the
splurge
.
This
will
be
the
first
place
we
stop
next
time
we
are
in
Madison
.
Our
server
was
friendly
and
everything
we
ordered
was
delicious.My
wife
and
I
have
been
here
twice
and
have
loved
it
each
time
!
This
is
not
only
a
nice
place
to
go
if
you
're
craving
something
vegetarian
.
They
have
great
sandwiches
and
bowls
that
are
enjoyable
,
The
pies
are
usually
fantastic
!
So
many
choices
...
I
do
n't
think
you
can
go
wrong
.
For
a
place
that
looks
like
your
classic
greasy
diner
,
it
offers
a
more
home-cooked
feel
with
a
veggie
vibe
.
Definitely
worth
checking
out!I
love
Monty
's
.
The
atmosphere
is
kitschy
and
cool
,
and
they
have
something
for
everyone
-LRB-
even
the
vegetarians
and
picky
eaters
-RRB-
.
The
wait
can
be
a
little
on
the
excessive
side
,
so
do
n't
hold
off
until
you
're
hungry
.
I
never
manage
to
save
room
for
dessert
,
but
I
hear
the
pies
are
excellent.They
always
have
better
than
average
waitstaff
.
They
have
plenty
of
vegetarian
options
for
classic
diner
food
that
they
do
very
well
.
Many
other
places
try
to
awkwardly
replace
meat
with
tofu
and
end
up
failing
.
Monty
's
mostly
knows
when
to
use
seitan
,
beans
,
walnut
burgers
,
tofu
and
has
a
nice
variety
.
They
're
often
busy
,
so
do
n't
go
if
you
ca
n't
wait
.
Some
of
the
dishes
are
phenomenal
and
some
are
simply
okay
.
I
think
it
makes
getting
an
average
dish
more
disappointing
when
last
time
,
you
got
something
so
wonderful
,
but
c'est
la
vie
.
Remember
what
you
like
and
see
what
others
have
enjoyed
.
-LRB-
TNT
BLT
is
amazing
,
the
Sheldon
is
meh
.
-RRB-
Also
,
remember
to
eat
your
dessert
first
,
the
portions
are
generous
and
you
do
n't
want
to
miss
out
on
such
an
important
part
of
the
meal.Monty
's
is
one
of
my
fave
brunch-or-lunch
places
,
especially
on
lazy
weekends
when
I
want
breakfast
food
at
2pm
but
do
not
want
big-chain
food
.
They
have
a
wide
array
of
something
for
everyone
from
vegan
offerings
to
biscuits
and
gravy
to
slices
of
cake
taller
than
your
head
,
and
it
's
all
tasty
.
It
does
get
really
crowded
at
peak
times
,
and
the
service
can
be
hit-or-miss
to
an
extreme
:
sometimes
I
've
gotten
a
server
who
hangs
around
making
hilarious
jokes
and
sometimes
I
've
been
in
parties
that
were
actually
forgotten
about
after
we
were
seated
and
then
have
the
orders
wrong
when
we
finally
did
get
our
food
-LRB-
although
the
bad
service
is
definitely
more
rare
than
the
good
-RRB-
.
All-in-all
the
tasty
food
and
the
kitschy
atmosphere
make
it
worth
the
wait.This
is
a
great
restaurant
to
go
to
in
a
charming
neighborhood
.
Gramma

Take

Jackpot
!
As
a
bonus
:
With
it
's
proximity
to
the
storied
Barrymore
Theater
,
it
is
not
uncommon
to
dine
amongst
musical
geniusii
.
Diner-esque
feel
and
fare
with
lots
of
visual
distractions
-LRB-
you
may
need
them
for
the
inevitable
wait
-RRB-
You
will
more
than
likely
hear
screams
of
ecstasy
after
someone
has
the
pie
.
Comfort
food

-LRB-
Yes

Hmmmmmmm

Do
you

Well
,
whomever
does
the
hiring
at
Monte
's
does
too
.
I
have
not
seen
one
unattractive
employee
yet
.
Besides
being
beautiful
,
they
are
efficient
in
their
positions
.
The
waitstaff
is
friendly
and
quick
,
cooks
have
yet
to
fail
my
taste

,
and
the
bakers
make
some
of
the
yummiest
cakes
in
the
state
.
For
maximum
food
coma-ry
,
I
'd
recommend
the
-LRB-
fake
-RRB-
meatloaf
w/cashew
gravy
,
mashed
potatoes
,
a
mimosa
chased
with
a
piece
of
Fat
Elvis
cake
.
Remember
you
are
in
Wisconsin
and
you
do
n't
have
to
have
any
regard
for
caloric
intakes
any
longer
,
and
eat
til
you
either
pass
out
or
essplode
,
no
judgment
.
In
fact
the
fake
meatloaf/cashew
gravy
is
so
fabulous
,
that
I
have
sent
a
mole
into
the
kitchens
of
Monte
's
to
snag
the
recipe
.
Yes
,
I
am
that
powerful/desperate
.
Love
this
place
.
Gets
crowded
around
the
normal
brunch
time
,
so
go
early
or
go
late
.
Otherwise
,
it
's
probably
going
to
be
at
least
a
30
minute
wait
.
Huge
portions
.
Love
their
omelets
.
Lots
of
vegetarian
options
-LRB-
if
that
's
your
thing
-
not
mine
-RRB-
.
Have
n't
tried
their
desserts
,
but
they
always
look
tasty
.
Service
:
Good
.
I
've
always
had
very
nice
servers
.
And
I
'm
willing
to
cut
them
slack
since
they
're
always
really
busy
.
Plus
they
're
pretty
quick
with
the
coffee
refills
.
Environment
:
Old
school
diner
feel
-
with
booths
and
stools
!
Does
n't
feel
cramped
even
when
it
gets
crowded
.
Side
notes
:
I
LOVE
diners
.
Also
,
if
you
eat
the
biscuit
,
you
're
a
fatty.Lunch
on
a
Saturday
afternoon
,
with
2
small
kids
?
No
problem
.
Monty
's
provided
chalk
outside
for
use
while
you
waited
-LRB-
15
min
was
quoted
,
actual
wait
time
was
...
well
...
who
pays
attention
to
the
clock
when
you
're
busy
chalking
?
-RRB-
.
Kids
menus
and
cups
were
also
provided
,
and
the
waiter
did
n't
bat
an
eye
at
the
mess
the
kids
made
.
The
menu
is
varied
-
breakfast
,
entrees
,
sammiches
-
but
steps
outside
of
the
`
normal
'
fare
to
throw
a
few
curveballs
.
My
spinach/feta
burger
tasted
fresh
and
not
mass-produced
.
Only
downside
is
that
the
place
is
loud
-
but
then
,
that
turns
into
a
positive
when
you
're
with
a
hungry
11month
old
.
:
-RRB-
Hash
was
a
smash
for
me
.
Also
Tim
the
owner
sang
us
a
Dylan
song
.
Great
biscuits
,
also
liked
the
potatoes
.
It
is
a
must
try
if
you
are
in
Mad-town
.
Great
local
diner
,
that
features
lost
of
creative
dishes-like
zucchini
pancakes
.
Awesome
bakery
and
great
,
home
cooking
.
While
i
'm
prone
to
go
with
breakfast
items
,
the
lunch
offerings
have
also
always
been
good
.
I
do
n't
think
you
can
really
go
wrong
here
.
Decor
screams
old-time
diner
,
maybe
even
at
the
expense
of
feeling
a
little
bit
forced
.
All
the
same
,
this
place
should
be
a
regular
stop
for
anybody
in
madison.We
had
a
wonderful
breakfast
here
but
the
most
wonderful
thing
was
that
the
manager
sang
for
us
...
We
loved
it
--
the
place
brought
back
all
the
warm
fuzzy
feelings
that
we
get
for
Madison
and
Wisconsin
and
we
were
here
with
our
son
and
girlfriend
and
had
a
great
time
...
Fantastic
vegetarian
and
nonvegetarian
food
alike
,
great
ice
cream
,
adult
beverage
selection
is
to
die
for
.
Bloody
mary
's
on
a
sunday
morning
?
Yes
please.Great
service
and
atmosphere
.
The
food
is
good
-
comfort
food
for
the
soul.I
was
disappointed
with
my
experience
,
but
I
'm
willing
to
give
it
another
shot
.
The
main
problem
was
our
waiter
.
We
had
very
slow
service
.
We
were
seated
outside
and
had
to
go
in
to
ask
for
our
menus
.
I
ordered
coffee
and
half-and-half
,
but
I
did
n't
get
a
spoon
or
something
to
stir
it
with
,
which
I
thought
was
odd
.
I
just
kind
of
swished
it
around
...
It
was
weird
.
Our
waiter
failed
to
tell
us
the
scrambler
special
and
when
we
asked
he
told
us
it
was
artichoke
,
tomato
and
asiago
.
However
,
when
it
arrived
the
artichokes
were
not
there
.
It
was
very
disappointing
.
The
breakfast
potatoes
were
also
a
real
let
down
.
I
love
potatoes
and
they
failed
.
However
,
the
biscuit
was
delicious
.
We
also
ordered
pie
.
Two
of
our
party
ordered
the
Fat
Elvis
-
which
does
not
come
in
a
pie-form
-
so
they
were
upset
.
Their
other
waiter
must
have
made
that
mistake
.
I
went
for
the
key
lime
pie
which
was
delicious
.
The
Fat
Elvis
was
replaced
with
a
drumstick
-LRB-
?
-RRB-
which
I
guess
was
good
,
but
I
do
n't
like
peanut
butter
.
Another
thing
is
if
you
sit
outside
,
they
will
give
you
plastic
silverware
.
I
did
n't
mind
,
but
others
in
my
party
did
.
Also
,
they
only
take
Visa
and
Mastercard
.
Overall
,
the
food
was
good
,
but
the
service
was
not
.
Andrew
K
attempted
to
show
off
his
humor
-LRB-
``
Elvis
has
left
the
building
''
-RRB-
,
but
we
found
it
rather
obnoxious
because
we
were
sick
of
waiting
.
I
'll
give
him
some
slack
because
there
were
a
lot
of
people
seated
outside
,
but
I
feel
he
could
have
paid
a
bit
more
attention.Really
cool
&
interesting
veggie
options
,
cool
atmosphere
,
nice
area
,
what
more
could
you
ask
for
?
They
even
have
a
giant
selection
of
pies
!
Voted
best
veggie
restaurant
in
madison
,
but
half
of
the
menu
or
more
isnt
veggie
,
so
everyone
will
be
happy
.
Check
it
out.Donut
french
toast
.
Enough
said
.
:
-RRB-
Won
best
greasy
spoon
in
Madison
,
yet
has
vegan
options
and
bean
salad
as
an
alternative
to
fries
!
Yes
,
a
great
retro
diner
,
but
with
modern
options
.
And
a
dessert
case
.
Awesome!Yum
.
Have
been
here
a
few
times
,
and
have
never
left
disappointed
.
It
's
an
easy
choice
on
my
``
vegan
''
days
when
I
still
want
something
that
feels
sort
of
bad
for
you
and
diner-y
-LRB-
versus
Green
Owl
,
which
is
fantastic
but
sometimes
feels
TOO
healthy
-RRB-
.
All
the
sandwhiches
I
've
tried
have
been
great
,
and
the
pie
is
SOOO
good
-
especially
any
one
with
peanut
butter
in
it
.
Service
can
be
a
little
slow
and
invisible
,
at
times
,
but
the
food
makes
it
totally
worth
it
.
Looking
forward
to
hitting
it
up
again
in
the
fall.Stopped
here
on
the
way
home
from
the
Dells
because
you
bastards
said
it
was
good
and
guess
what
!?
I
AGREE
!
Aside
from
the
fact
that
it
was
freezing
cold
in
there
,
I
realllllllllly
enjoyed
the
hell
our
of
this
place
.
First
of
all
,
the
menu
is
composed
of
a
bunch
of
awesome
dishes
;
I
wanted
to
order
everything
on
the
menu
.
It
was
as
if
they
had
scanned
the
portion
of
my
brain
that
deals
with
Amanda
eating
habits
and
wrote
a
menu
based
on
the
data
collected
from
the
scan
.
Fettucini
Alfredo
and
a
turkey
dinner
!?
Blue
Plate
,
you
should
n't
have
!
I
'll
order
both
!
Actually
,
I
got
a
turkey
sandwich
with
avocado
on
it
.
I
realllllly
like
avocado
.
I
really
like
turkey
sandwiches
,
too
,
and
let
me
tell
you
Blue
Plate
did
not
disappoint
.
Everything
was
mad
good
from
the
salad
to
the
fries
to
the
sandwich
.
Cheap
prices
,
good
portions
...
If
you
're
in
the
area
I
definitely
suggest
you
hit
this
place
up
.
Mail
me
the
leftovers!I
've
been
to
Monty
's
at
least
once
for
every
meal
.
The
omelettes
are
to
die
for
,
huge
in
quantity
unique
in
ingredients
-
highly
recommend
the
spinach
and
feta
.
The
salads
are
the
same
thing
,
definitely
large
and
delicious
.
Last
night
I
went
for
dinner
and
got
the
meatless
loaf
,
and
now
I
want
the
recipe
for
the
cashew
gravy
-LRB-
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly
,
it
was
cashew
...
-RRB-
to
put
on
EVERYTHING
.
Amazing
shakes
and
malts
complete
the
perfect
comfort/diner
food
experience.Monty
's
is
obviously
a
popular
and
beloved
place
,
judging
by
the
number
of
reviews
,
and
rightly
so
.
Hard
to
beat
the
combination
of
an
old-school
setting
and
really
good
food
.
The
only
knock
against
it
is
the
crowds
,
especially
for
weekend
breakfast
.
But
do
make
an
effort
to
have
breakfast
there
sometime
-
the
donut
French
toast
is
fantastic
.
They
also
have
great
pies
and
desserts
,
and
they
do
all
the
diner
standards
really
well.Oh
my
why
did
n't
I
review
this
place
,
like
,
a
year
ago
?
What
's
not
to
like
about
Monty
's
.
The
only
bad
thing
-LRB-
which
is
really
a
great
thing
-RRB-
is
all
menu
choices
,
especially
if
you
're
a
vegetarian
.
It
's
sort
of
scaled-up-diner-food-meets-comfort-food
,
then
add
a
fair
share
healthy
options
.
And
great
prices
.
And
great
service
.
Although
it
's
not
on
Willy
St.
it
still
has
the
same
friendly
neighborhood
atmosphere
.
So
I
've
been
to
Monty
's
twice
,
both
times
late
morning
,
and
was
seated
and
served
quickly
.
The
first
visit
a
friend
and
I
split
the
spinach
and
feta
omelet
which
was
great
and
large
enough
for
both
of
us
,
and
a
third
friend
had
the
salmon
hash
.
After
our
meal
Monty
himself
-LRB-
well
,
not
sure
if
it
was
the
Real
Monty
,
so
lets
say
the
chef
-RRB-
came
out
to
ask
us
how
our
meal
was
.
The
second
visit
I
went
with
a
lunch
item
and
ordered
chicken
fried
steak
,
also
great
and
the
portions
were
easily
enough
for
two
people
.
Once
again
Monty
came
out
and
greeted
his
diners
!
Ordered
a
piece
of
Fat
Elvis
cake
to
go
,
which
is
banana
cake
layered
with
peanut
butter
fudge
icing
and
topped
with
chocolate
icing
.
Yum!Yum
!
Monty
's
was
absolutely
adorable
.
After
eating
dinner
there
I
can
say
with
certainty
this
will
become
one
of
my
new
regulars
.
Right
when
I
walked
in
I
knew
it
would
be
a
place
I
would
enjoy
.
The
atmosphere
was
that
of
an
older
,
trendy
diner
and
had
a
quick
moving
,
upbeat
,
friendly
staff
making
the
atmosphere
even
more
enjoyable
.
My
friend
got
the
artichoke
sandwich
,
delicious
,
and
I
got
the
chicken
in
a
pie
,
right
from
grandma
's
kitchen
.
Afterwards
we
ordered
a
red
velvet
cupcake
which
was
to
die
for
,
and
all
for
under
$
15
.
We
shared
great
conversation
and
did
n't
feel
at
all
rushed
,
our
waitress
was
great
.
She
made
recommendations
and
shared
jokes
with
us
,
not
seeming
to
put
up
a
front
at
all
.
I
will
be
going
back
sooner
rather
than
later.In
my
opinion
,
almost
all
restaurants
in
the
Madison
area
are
bland
.
People
may
hate
me
for
thinking
it
,
but
I
do
n't
care
.
There
's
no
spice
,
little
flavor
,
and
it
's
gotten
to
the
point
where
I
just
do
n't
really
go
out
,
because
I
'm
sick
of
wasting
my
money
on
mediocre
food
.
It
got
to
the
point
where
I
thought
my
tastebuds
were
dying
.
Enter
Monty
's
Blue
Plate
.
I
had
the
meatless
loaf
sammich
,
and
it
was
awesome
,
though
it
tasted
nothing
like
meatloaf
.
The
waffle
fries
?
delicious
.
The
dipping
sauce
?
Do
n't
even
think
of
stealing
a
dip
.
I
will
bite
you
.
There
was
so
much
I
wanted
.
I
will
be
back
,
perhaps
tomorrow
.
I
will
find
excuses
to
wander
to
the
east
side
,
then
say
``
While
I
'm
here
,
I
might
as
well
hit
Monty
's
''
.
All-in-all
,
Monty
's
is
making
my
life
better
.
Thank
you
Monty
's
.
Okay
,
I
straight
up
ordered
the
``
heathen
vegans
shoplifter
's
delight
''
because
of
the
name
.
I
'm
not
proud
of
my
devil
may
care
attitude
when
it
comes
to
ordering
food
,
but
reckless
abandon
at
Monty
's
has
proven
fruitful
.
Delightful
meal
.
Everything
about
it
matched
the
hippy
dippy
quarky
way
of
MadCity
life
.
Service
was
a
shade
slow
and
it
was
n't
crowded
by
any
means
,
but
I
had
good
company
.
Who
cares.Friendly
staff
and
nice
selection
of
vegetarian
options
.
Food
is
just
okay
,
not
great
.
Makes
me
wonder
why
everyone
likes
Food
Fight
so
much.Eh
.
This
place
is
``
fine
''
.
I
'm
not
terribly
impressed
with
it
.
I
could
probably
get
better
breakfast
somewhere
else
.
Plus
its
ALWAYS
so
so
so
busy
in
there
.
I
like
that
they
have
a
ton
of
vegetarian
options
.
Which
is
rare
for
breakfast
places
.
But
meh
.
Its
not
amazing
food.One
of
madison
's
best
restaurants
.
Casual
,
come
as
you
are
atmosphere
.
Best
meatloaf
and
other
comfort
foods
on
the
planet.Pros
:
Vegetarian
Meatloaf
of
the
Gods
-LRB-
with
a
yummy
peanut
gravy
-RRB-
Lots
of
cakes/pies
Cons
:
Slow
and
often
rude
service
Awful
bloody

suuper
salty
-RRB-
Overcooked

Is
it
just
me
or
is
it
always
cold
in
there?Great
place
,
I
visited
there
this
weekend
and
the
service
was
blazing
fast
.
I
had
the
goat
cheese
chicken
sandwich
and
it
was
excellent!If
your
vegetarian
or
not
you
will
LOVE
this
place
...
I
think
they
put
crack
in
their
food
its
so
good
!
I
like
everything
here
,
but
I
take
it
to
go
.
.
I
hate
being
the
creep
lone
diner
-
no
Table
for
One
...
There
is
on
weird
waiter
I
must
admit
but
the
food
is
so
good
...
I
like
their
hash
and
their
tofu
scramble
...
I
worship
Monty
's
.
Yummy
food
.
Service
is
usually
great
-LRB-
but
there
are
the
occasional
slip-ups
-RRB-
.
Small
dining
room
;
booth
seats
and
bar
seating
-LRB-
try
to
grab
a
bar
stool
so
you
do
n't
have
to
wait
in
line
-RRB-
.
Wait
can
range
from
15-30
minutes
,
I
've
never
waited
longer
but
probably
would
.
Breakfast
is
my
favorite
,
although
lunch
is
great
too
.
I
usually
get
the
regular
,
eggs
,
potatoes
,
bacon/sausage
and
biscuit
.
I
switch
my
biscuit
out
for
toast
-LRB-
I
just
do
n't
like
biscuits
,
sorry
!
-RRB-
.
My
mom
,
the
vegan
,
usually
orders
her
regular
tofu
scrambler
...
not
bad
!
But
the
potatoes
are
why
I
'm
there
.
They
give
you
plenty
and
it
usually
looks
like
I
have
n't
even
touched
my
meal
after
I
'm
done
.
Try
the
Meatloaf
sandwich
for
lunch
.
Yum
!
There
waffle
fries
are
also
delicious
.
They
have
a
display
of
pies
in
the
front
,
though
I
've
never
tried

The
delicious
breakfast
,
nice
staff
,
and
cozy
environment
sold
me.Service
was
great
and
I
like
the
atmosphere
but
I
would
n't
say
it
's
anything
special
-LRB-
except
for
the
the
shakes
and
meatloaf
-
fit
for
the
gods
for
sure
!
-RRB-
.
Awesome
dougnuts
!
Great
place
to
take
the
grandparents
--
there
is
something
that
everyone
will
like
.
Great
coffee
.
Nice
new
`
local
meats
'
section
of
the
menu.I
have
returned
again
and
again
for
Monty
's
eggs
mornay
.
When
I
first
ordered
it
I
thought
I
was
getting
a
typical
eggs
benedict
for
breakfast
but
then
something
so
much
better
came
out
.
Eggs
mornay
is
eggs
benedict
made
with
a
mornay
sauce
instead
of
hollondaise
sauce
.
The
mornay
sauce
is
creamier
and
peppery
!
It
is
so
good
.
I
once
met
a
man
who
ordered
a
different
breakfast
but
asked
for
a
side
of
the
mornay
sauce
to
dip
his
potatoes
in
...
that
's
my
kind
of
breakfast
!
I
've
had
their
burgers
and
meatloaf
as
well
,
both
are
equally
good
but
I
keep
coming
back
for
the
eggs
mornay
!
I
've
also
had
their
red
velvet
cupcakes
which
are
pretty
great
too!When
I
was
in
Madison
as
a
student
I
loved
to
go
to
the
Blue
Plate
with
friends
because
they
always
had
options
for
the
meat
eaters
and
the
vegetarians
.
As
a
former
vegetarian
,
I
think
I
first
came
here
when
I
was
a
vegetarian
.
It
was
a
long
time
ago
.
The
diner
theme
is
part
of
the
aesthetic
here
,
and
my
favorite
dishes
are
the
meat
loaf
,
and
the
breakfast
scrambles
.
My
friend
and
I
got
two
big
breakfasts
and
the
service
was
good
on
what
looked
like
a
crazy-busy
Sunday
brunch-rush
.
The
coffee
dude
was
keeping
our
cups
full
and
warm
as
our
server
was
moving
past
us
bringing
out
amazing
plates
of
super
fresh
food
,
yet
always
checking
with
us
to
see
how
we
were
doing
.
Busy
,
high
quality
standards
,
and
lots
of
great
cakes
and
pies
if
you
have
any
room
.
I
used
to
get
the
pie/cake
to
go
,
but
not
this
time
.
It
is
just
wonderful
to
see
a
place
that
was
good
over
10
years
ago
,
still
keeping
its
standards
high
and
keeping
people
like
me
wishing
they
still
lived
in
Madison
!
Great
place
.
Great
food
.
Great
people.Really
love
it
here
,
I
would
come
here
a
lot
more
often
if
it
were
easier
to
get
a
table
during
meal
times
.
The
space
is
totally
retro
,
very
comfortable
and
has
the
chill
feel
of
Madison
.
There
is
n't
really
seating
for
groups
larger
than
about
six
people
,
and
even
then
it
can
be
a
squeeze
.
I
've
always
considered
their
meals
to
be
very
consistent
,
which
is
key
.
My
favorite
thing
is
their
GBLT
and
waffle
fries
.
The
sandwich
has
some
awesome
chipotle
sauce
that
gives
it
a
special
kick
and
the
guac
is
always
fresh
tasting
.
Another
highlight
:
alcoholic
milkshakes
,
hell
yeah
!
I
like
the
range
of
the
menu
,
there
are
many
vegetarian
and
vegan
options
,
and
breakfast
is
served
allllll
day
!
The
staff
is
always
very
friendly
,
service
can
be
a
little
slow
,
but
it
generally
is
n't
an
issue
because
the
place
is
pretty
small.Excellent
food
.
The
biscuits
are
amazing
,
the
fruit
fresh
and
ripe
,
and
I
had
the
best
piece
of
French
silk
pie
I
've
ever
had
at
this
place
.
I
've
only
ordered
breakfast
,
but
they
do
have
an
expansive
menu
that
includes
a
nice
selection
of
foods
-LRB-
including
vegan
-RRB-
.
The
atmosphere
is
probably
what
stops
me
from
going
there
more
--
it
's
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
.
The
lighting
is
harsh
and
the
seats
can
be
kinda
uncomfortable
.
Last
time
I
went
,
I
was
freezing
!
But
do
n't
let
that
stop
you
.
There
's
an
amazing
bakery
display
case
in
the
front
that
is
worth
a
stop
alone.Monty
's
Blue
Plate
has
consistently
satisfied
me
year
in
and
year
out
.
They
are
a
corner
stone
as
far
as
diners
go
in
Madison
.
If
you
are
looking
for
something
hearty
and
kind
of
old
fashioned
,
I
suggest
the
meat
loaf
of
the
gods
,
perfectly
done
and
very
filling
.
If
you
are
a
veg
head
or
perhaps
vegan
,
the
heathen
vegan
's
shoplifter
delight
is
a
must
.
Monty
's
I
love
you
!!
Monty
's
is
a
place
you
can
go
where
the
veg
selections
do
n't
feel
like
an
afterthought
.
Order
``
The
Sheldon
''
...
Trust
me
.
Also
,
amazing
waitstaff
and
very
good
coffeeMonty
's
,
Monty
's
...
.
I
love
you
Monty
's
.
I
love
your
grilled
chicken
salad
.
I
love
all
your
sandwiches
.
I
love
the
coffee
and
fountain
drinks
.
I
get
frustrated
when
the
wait
is
long
...
and
I
'm
sorry
.
.
the
pies
are
beautiful
and
the
fillings
are
delicious
,
but
the
pie
crusts
are
NOT
flaky
.
You
ca
n't
have
a
pie
without
a
flaky
crust
.
It
aint
fitting
!
I
wish
you
would
open
up
a
Monty
's
in
Fitchburg
!
I
love
you
Monty
's
!
After
posting
my
2-star
review
,
I
received
a
message
from
a
manager
at
Monty
's
,
asking
if
he
could
send
me
some
vouchers
and
if
I
would
be
willing
to
give
them
another
try
.
I
happily
did
that
,
and
got
the
vouchers
soon
after
!
I
have
since
been
back
to
Monty
's
twice
,
once
for
breakfast
and
another
time
for
dinner
.
The
service
has
been
great
both
times
;
prompt
and
friendly
.
The
food
is
pretty
good
,
and
is
definitely
a
good
value
.
The
prices
might
not
be
super
cheap
,
but
you
get
a
lot
of
food
!
I
've
gotten
poached
eggs
twice
since
I
wrote
my
more
negative
review
of
Monty
's
,
and
both
times
the
eggs
have
been
cooked
perfectly.This
place
has
classic
American
diner
written
all
over
it
.
I
have
yet
to
have
even
a
subpar
experience
at
this
place
.
``
So
,
tell
me
abou
the
food
''
you
ask
.
I
've
been
to
Monty
's
for
breakfast
,
and
lunch
and
have
had
a
consistently
great
meal
every
time
.
The
breakfast
menu
offers
up
your
standards
.
Heaping
portions
of
eggs
and
bacon
accompany
a
decent
cup
of
coffee
early
in
the
morning
.
Their
sandwiches
are
delicious
and
massive
.
The
burgers
offer
a
unique
collection
of
flavorings
and
are
made
with
beef
sourced
from
Black
Earth
Farms
...
a
big
plus
from
any
foodie
in
the
city
.
Definitely
break
the
bank
and
opt
in
for
the
waffle
fries
...
and
by
break
the
bank
I
mean
scrounge
your
pockets
for
the
extra
quarter
the
cost
.
They
are
YUMMMMMY
The
only
knock
I
have
on
this
place
is
the
overall
vibe
.
The
staff
always
goes
above
and
beyond
what
I
would
expect
,
but
the
whole
50s
diner
scene
never
really
held
a
special
place
in
my
heart
.
Even
with
saying
that
,
I
'll
definitely
be
back
many
,
many
times.If
I
could
give
this
place
10
stars
I
would
.
I
've
been
coming
here
since
opened
and
it
is
consistently
the
best
.
Breakfast
all
day
,
more
than
just
burgers
and
fries
,
deserts
,
beer
selection
...
I
ca
n't
rave
enough
.
The
meatloaf
of
the
Gods
is
to
die
for
and
their
Just
Coffee
roast
-LRB-
their
own
blend
-RRB-
is
so
amazingly
good
I
have
my
mom
buy
it
and
send
it
up
to
me
in
Minneapolis
.
It
's
that
good
.
Some
of
the
people
that
work
there
have
been
there
since
I
was
a
kid
.
Its
a
neighborhood
place
where
you
're
bound
to
run
into
people
you
know
and
I
make
a
point
to
go
there
at
least
twice
while
I
'm
home
to
visit
.
Yay
Monty
's
!
I
like
Monty
's
food
--
breakfast
,
lunch
,
and
dinner
are
all
very
good
--
but
I
just
ca
n't
help
thinking
that
it
's
overpriced
when
I
go
there
.
It
seems
like
it
should
be
diner-priced
...
but
almost
$
9
for
a
grilled
cheese
seems
a
bit
steep
to
me
.
Their
desserts
are
to
die
for
,
though.What
a
great
place
for
brunch
,
not
to
mention
filling
!
I
've
only
been
there
once
,
but
had
to
try
it
because
I
kept
getting
so
many
recommendations
.
I
had
the
chicken
salad
sandwich
,
not
to
saucy
or
creamy
,
and
fresh
.
It
had
chopped
chicken
and
salad
on
a
ciabatta
roll
.
it
had
a
great
flavor
.
I
also
switched
out
the
fries
for
the
house
potatoes
,
which
were
also
very
good
!
My
boyfriend
decided
to
go
with
breakfast
and
had
the
Huevos
Rancheros
,
he
loved
it
and
said
he
would
definitely
get
it
again
.
He
's
a
picky
eater
so
if
he
says
something
like
that
I
trust
that
the
food
is
good
.
I
also
ordered
one
of
their
specialty
milk
shakes
with
coffee
in
it
.
What
an
amazing
drink
!!!
I
would
definitely
go
back
over
and
over
again
!
And
I
'll
wait
with
no
problem
because
that
usually
means
that
the
food
is
worth
it
...
On
the
return
drive
from
the
north
,
we
wanted
a
fun
,
local
diner
with
great
food
.
Yelp
recommended
the
BPD
as
all
of
the
above
.
When
you
walk
in
you
are
immediately
presented
with
a
series
of
sinister
pies
.
All
shapes
,
sizes
and
flavors
.
Man
I
got
ta
save
room
for
that
.
We
went
to
our
booth
and
were
immediately
surrounded
by
families
and
folks
just
having
desserts
:
exactly
what
we
were
looking
for
.
For
dinner
,
we
had
a
very
delicious
chicken
pie
-LRB-
how
comforting
,
yet
nuked
perhaps
?
-RRB-
and
a
vegan
burger
that
was
amazing
!
I
have
honestly
never
had
such
a
delicious
vegan
burger
.
After
reviewing
the
menu
I
quickly
realized
there
were
many
vegan
options
.
Excellent
!
In
all
,
our
simple
dinner
came
to
$
22
for
both
.
We
skipped
the
dessert
simply
because
we
ran
out
of
room
in
our
tums.My
girlfriend
and
I
stopped
here
for
dinner
last
night
and
we
were
both
impressed
with
the
quality
and
the
price
of
the
diner
food
.
The
beef
is
local
,
from
Black
Earth
,
and
the
coffee
is
their
own
blend
.
The
cupcakes
were
awesome
!!
Our
waitress
was
really
friendly
and
prompt
also.The
service
is
excellent
,
the
atmosphere
a
time
capsule
of
a
50s
diner
&
the
food
is
some
of
the
best
diner
fair
I
've
ever
had
.
The
Meatloaf
is
called
the
``
Meatloaf
of
the
Gods
,
''
and
it
truly
is
.
I
do
n't
even
like
Meatloaf
and
I
literally
savored
each
bite
of
this
culinary
masterpiece
.
It
is
extremely
filling
because
it
is
made
with
nutrient
rich
local
meat
,
savory
vegetables
&
topped
with
the
best
gravy
I
've
ever
tasted
.
Yum
!
For
$
10
,
how
ca
n't
it
be
``
As
good
as
it
gets
?
''
If
you
like
pie
,
also
make
sure
to
get
a
slice
.
It
is
delicious!It
was
our
first
time
visiting
Monty
's
Blue
Plate
Diner
and
we
will
be
going
back
our
next
time
in
Madison
!
Fun
atmosphere
,
great
food
,
nice
variety
on
the
menu
and
not
overwhelming
,
excellent
service
,
AWESOME
desserts
,
great
prices
...
we
only
wish
there
was
another
one
close
to
where
we
live
:
-RRB-
Yum
&
cool
.
Zucchini
pancakes
!
Feeling
like
you
want
retro
?
Monty
's
is
the
place
.
Madison
has
the
best
food
,
this
place
is
should
on
your
list
to
try.Gross
,
disgusting
,
rip-off
.
This
place
makes
me
seriously
doubt
the
Madisonian
palate
.
I
had
a
cheeseburger
from
here
a
few
nights
ago
.
I
asked
for
medium
-
which
to
Monty
's
means
completely
raw
in
random
spots
.
Aside
from
the
random
rawness
,
the
burger
tasted
like
it
was
over
seasoned
with
pepper
.
The
meat
was
of
absolute
shit
quality
,
the
bottom
bun
was
soggy
-LRB-
probably
from
undercooked
meat
juices
-RRB-
,
and
I
did
get
it
to
go
.
Thanks
for
the
ketchup
and
mustard
packets
-
now
that
's
classy
.
I
have
no
reason
to
set
foot
in
this
place
.
Every
experience
I
've
had
up
to
point
makes
me
wonder
why
I
bothered
to
return
one
more
time
.
Maybe
there
's
something
wrong
with
my
palate
,
but
to
be
honest
,
I
'm
pretty
certain
that
there
's
not
.
East
side
institution
?
What
a
joke!I
have
n't
been
to
Monty
's
in
at
least
15
years
,
so
it
was
really
nice
to
visit
Madison
and
return
to
find
it
just
as
great
as
I
remember
.
Great
atmosphere
and
excellent
service
.
Really
excellent
service
.
I
had
the
Blackened
Salmon
Salad
,
which
was
great
-
I
love
that
they
have
some
healthy
options
.
My
kids
opted
for
pancakes
,
eggs
and
bacon
-
all
good
.
My
husband
,
who
usually
comments
on
how
expensive
a
meal
outside
McDonald
's
is
,
actually
made
a
``
hey
reasonable
price
''
sort
of
comment
.
That
's
sayin
'
something
for
the
value!We
stop
here
regularly
and
are
generally
pleased
with
the
food
.
Huge
servings
generally
mean
a
two
for
one
deal
--
you
get
dinner
and
lunch
the
next
day
.
Vegetarian/vegan
options
as
well
as
old
fashioned
meat
choices
like
fried
chicken
and
meatloaf
.
All
are
quite
tasty
.
The
only
real
disappointment
is
the
desserts
.
They
LOOK
great
in
the
prominent
display
case
,
but
they
just
do
n't
have
much
going
for
them
except
fat
and
sugar
.
It
would
be
good
for
the
fruit
pies
to
taste
a
little
like
fruit
and
the
chocolate
desserts
to
have
the
richness
and
depth
of
chocolate
.
Just
lots
of
fat
and
sugar
so
that
generally
,
all
the
desserts
taste
about
the
same
.
The
crumble-top
pies
are
problematic
both
in
terms
of
flavor
and
texture
-LRB-
and
the
fat/sugar
problem
-RRB-
.
That
explains
my
3-star
review
.
Long
story
short
,
come
for
dinner
and
stop
for
frozen
custard
on
the
way
home.I
've
been
coming
here
since
I
was
in
middle
school
and
it
was
the
cool
place
to
hang
out
on
half-days
.
6
orders
of
waffle
fries
,
anyone
?
We
went
last
night
for
an
early
dinner
and
squeezed
7
people
into
a
booth
.
I
got
blueberry
pancakes
-LRB-
LOVE
breakfast
all
day
-RRB-
and
they
were
okay
.
My
friend
's
french
toast
came
with
apple
butter
though
,
and
slathered
on
top
of
the
pancakes
=
much
better
pancakes
.
Around
the
table
there
were
also
a
few
types
of
burgers
,
a
meatloaf
sandwich
,
a
fruit
plate
,
and
a
whole
lot
of
milkshakes
and
sundaes
.
Big
let
down
:
they
were
out
of
over
half
of
the
mix-ins
for
the
milkshakes/sundaes
.
You
ca
n't
have
a
dirt
cup
without
gummy
worms
!
Overall
,
I
've
always
liked
it
here
.
Service
can
be
hit
or
miss
.
Food
is
pretty
good
.
Milkshakes
are
hurt-your-teeth
sweet.The
meatloaf
in
every
form
is
superb
.
There
are
three
options
,
meatless
,
sandwich
,
and
entree
,
and
they
are
all
`
of
the
gods
.
'
Absolute
favorite
place.Monty
's
is
one
of
the
many
mind-boggling
Food
Fight
restaurants
that
is
a
Madison
favorite
despite
serving
mediocre
food
.
I
've
eaten
one
good
dish
here
:
the
TNT
BLT
-LRB-
tempeh
and
tomato
-RRB-
.
And
the
chocolate
shake
is
good
if
you
need
to
consume
an
extraordinary
number
of
calories
on
any
given
day
.
The
last
time
I
went
,
I
did
so
because
a
friend
told
me
the
restaurant
is
attempting
to
make
a
switch
to
more
sustainability-conscious
,
organic
food
.
I
ordered
chili
that
was
pretty
much
inedible
.
On
another
night
,
my
boyfriend
ordered
a
soup
that
was
,
again
,
inedible
.
I
can
imagine
that
people
like
to
come
here
because
the
restaurant
resembles
an
old-school
diner
and
has
booths
,
which
are
fun
for
kids
to
sit
in
.
But
the
food
quality
is
generally
average
to
poor
.
The
brunch
I
've
had
is
tasteless
and
limited
,
and
you
are
not
getting
fresh
eggs
unless
you
order
them
over
easy
.
The
only
reason
I
give
Monty
's
two
stars
is
because
its
pies
are
great
.
And
once
in
a
while
,
I
can
stomach
a
TNT
BLT
because
someone
I
'm
with
persuades
me
to
give
Monty
's
one
...
more
...
try.I
recently
visited
Madison
and
went
to
Monty
's
.
Monty
's
is
honestly
such
a
great
diner
.
I
especially
love
their
chicken
pot
pie
...
very
filling
and
so
,
so
good
.
The
turkey
soup
is
really
yummy
as
well
.
And
the
pies
...
absolutely
amazing
!!
I
really
like
the
feel
of
the
restaurant
.
It
's
a
great
a
place
to
go
to
and
meet
up
with
friends
for
sure
.
Great
service
as
well
!
-LRB-
Leslie
is
an
awesome

Overall
,
a
great

all
around

Highly
suggest

the
desserts
!

There
's
nothing
I
can
add
to
the
reviews
here
other
than
to
say
this
is
truly

Next
time
I
'm
in
Madison
I
'd
like
to
try
it
for
breakfast.good
diner
food
with
lot
's
of
tasty
vegetarian
options
and
with
pie
or
cheesecake
for
dessert
...
This
place
has
it
all
:
a
huge
menu
that
's
perfectly
executed
,
loads
of
vegetarian/vegan
options
-LRB-
yet
plenty
to
keep
the
meat-eaters
happy
-RRB-
,
local
and
organic
options
,
and
quick
service
...
and
all
the
while
they
keep
the
prices
appropriately
cheap
for
a
diner
.
I
've
found
everything
there
to
be
tasty
,
and
the
place
is
always
clean
.
Their
Heathen
Vegan
Shoplifter
's
Delight
sandwich
is
possibly
the
best
thing
I
've
ever
tasted
.
The
only
downside
is
that
I
'm
always
too
full
to
try
one
of
their
great
looking
desserts!Yucky
greasy
food.It
's
a
cute
place
.
The
service
was
excellent
.
It
was
hard
to
choose
from
all
the
great-sounding
items
on
the
menu
.
For
the
first
ten
minutes
of
my
visit
,
I
was
really
happy
with
it
.
Then
the
food
came
.
Ohmigod
,
it
was
GROSS
!
I
ordered
fettuchini
with
goat
cheese
,
expecting
a
pile
of
noodles
,
some
alfredo-ish
sauce
and
cheese
over
the
top
,
and
maybe
if
I
was
lucky
a
few
pine
nuts
or
tomato
bits
or
herbs
.
Nuh-uh
.
It
was
like
somebody
took
a
huge
glob
of
cafeteria
noodles
,
rolled
them
around
in
a
cup
of
grated
cheese
,
put
a
stick
of
butter
on
top
and
microwaved
the
whole
mess
on
high
for
a
minute
.
The
garlic
bread
was
the
kind
of
roll
you
'd
use
to
make
a
sub
sandwich
dipped
in
some
garlic
butter
.
My
dog
has
deposited
more
appealing
piles
on
the
back
lawn
after
gorging
on
leftovers
.
Checking
out
the
other
tables
,
I
doubt
anything
else
would
have
been
a
better
choice
.
This
is
what
they
call
comfort
food
--
what
Mom
would
give
you
to
cheer
you
up
after
your
Little
League
team
lost
or
something
.
I
suppose
people
like
this
stuff
because
of
the
emotional
connotations
,
I
do
n't
know
.
My
actual
mom
knew
how
to
cook
.
She
would
have
called
this
stuff
``
white
food
.
''
The
servings
are
huge
,
except
for
the
side
salad
which
could
have
fit
in
a
teacup
.
Many
people
love
this
diner
.
If
you
're
a
mac-and-cheese
type
person
,
you
may
very
well
love
it
too.Sweet
potato
hash
is
fantastic
!
The
tofu
scramble
has
a
bit
of
a
spicy
kick
and
is
a
great
option
for
vegans
.
In
fact
,
their
veg
dishes
are
just
plain
good
.
Service
is
very
friendly
and
their
cheesecake
is
very
creamy
and
delicious.Super
Vegan/Vegetarian
friendly
,
and
can
will
accommodate
any
and
all
tastes
!
The
menu
is
pretty
much
impossible
to
choose
from
,
since
there
are
so
many
delicious
items
on
it
.
I
usually
break
down
and
get
one
of
their
awesome
burgers
.
I
only
travel
to
Madison
once
every
couple
years
to
visit
family
,
and
I
frequently
think
back
to
how
yummy
their
Walnut
veggie
patties
are
.
My
Grammy
always
orders
a
chocolate
malt
and
the
waffle
fries
-LRB-
which
are
top-notch
-RRB-
.
She
's
93
,
and
she
knows
what
's
up
.
This
is
the
place
to
be.One
of
my
favorite
brunch
spots
in
Madison
.
Good
vegan
and
vegetarian
options
as
well
.
I
'm
a
meat-eater
and
have
had
one
or
two
of
their
all
veggie
dishes
and
been
very
impressed
-LRB-
I
like
the
tofu
scrambler
-RRB-
Another
favorite
is
whatever
the
scrambler
of
the
day
is
.
Good
reuben
for
lunch
too.I
really
loved
this
restaurant
!
Homestyle
,
diner
food
with
a
twist
-
including
lots
of
options
for
vegetarians
.
The
service
was
outstanding
,
as
people
beyond
my
primary
server
helped
ensure
that
my
drink
was
full
and
needs
addressed
.
I
had
the
Ultimate
Mac
,
and
it
sure
was
ultimate
!
The
best
mac
n
'
cheese
I
've
ever
had
.
The
portion
size
was
definitely
enough
for
two
to
share
.
I
tried
not
to
think
about
the
calories
that
I
was
consuming
when
I
downed
the
entire
bowl
plus
the
two
pieces
of
garlic
bread
that
came
with
it.Everything
here
was
okay
.
The
food
was
okay
,
the
service
was
pretty
good
,
and
um
...
the
atmosphere
was
okay
?
There
's
nothing
particularly
compelling
here
for
me
to
write
about
.
My
food
was
enjoyable
,
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
.
There
seemed
to
be
a
lot
of
vegetarian
options
,
but
since
I
'm
not
vegetarian
in
the
least
,
that
did
n't
make
much
difference
to
me
.
Again
,
the
service
was
pretty
good
and
our
server
was
friendly
,
but
overall
nothing
too
exciting.A
late
night
dessert
run
with
my
pregnant
bestie
led
to
a
Monty
's
revelation
:
They
now
serve
-LRB-
organic
,
classy
-RRB-
Sassy
Cow
ice
cream
,
have
even
nicer
and
more
delectable
cheesecakes
and
their
brownie
sundae
puts
the
Ella
's
Sparkled
Kazoo
to
shame
.
Post-brownie
sundae
,
bestie
's
baby
to-be
kicked
.
I
think
it
was
the
hot
fudge.Its
a
great
place
.
Both
me
and
my
wife
thought
it
had
a
great
summer
feel
in
the
50s
.
What
's
nice
about
it
is
that
it
has
a
Madison
vegetarian
twist
.
If
we
would
've
been
hungrier
the
pies
looked
amazing
but
our
bellies
had
reached
their
capacity
.
Overall
quality
,
its
traditional
american
diner
feel
w
/
a
twist
of
Madison
.
Great
spot
for
a
sit
down
lunch
on
a
road
trip.I
LOVE
this
place-I
went
to
L'Etoile
on
Friday
night
and
Monty
's
Blue
Plate
on
Saturday
afternoon-guess
where
I
had
the
better
meal
?!?
Monty
's
won
by
a
landslide-a
giant
bowl
of
veggie
chili
,
a
square
of
jalapeno
corn
bread
as
big
as
my
head
and
a
slice
of
chocolate
rasberry
pie
a
la
mode
.
It
does
n't
get
much
better
than
this
folks
!
I
can
not
wait
to
go
back
,
I
've
actually
had
a
dream
about
that
pie!Whenever
I
get
the
chance
to
stop
over
in
this
great
city
I
always
try
to
swing
by
Monte
's
.
The
service
is
friendly
but
do
n't
expect
to
be
looked
into
every
2
minutes
.
Which
personally
I
prefer
.
This
has
a
very
local
feel
and
the
prices
are
just
right
.
I
had
the
Blue
Plate
special
with
egg
whites
.
It
was
wonderful
.
Not
greasy
.
The
artichoke
sandwhich
is
also
off
of
the
hook
!
Very
good
down
home
food
all
the
way
around
and
extremely
reasonably
priced
.
Especially
coming
from
the
West
Coast
.
The
other
added
bonus
is
Monte
's
is
located
in
the
Willy
Street
area
...
the
more
eclectic
part
of
``
downtown
''
.
I
have
no
idea
what
kind
of
Michelin
4-star
restaurant
some
of
these
reviewers
are
used
to
,
but
their
poor
ratings
of
this
Madison
staple
are
not
to
be
taken
seriously
.
Coming
from
someone
who
's
worked
professionally
in
the
food
industry
for
the
better
part
of
the
past
decade
,
in
bars
,
cafes
,
diners
,
organic
kitchens
,
and
hotels
,
this
diner-style
family
eatery
will
always
remain
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
places
to
go
,
for
any
meal
of
the
day
.
This
,
more
than
any
other
restaurant
in
Madison
,
is
what
I
missed
when
we
moved
away
.
Let
's
review
:
1
.
One
of
the
most
creative
,
delicious
,
varied
,
and
comprehensive
vegetarian
and
vegan
menus
I
've
ever
seen
,
especially
for
a
place
that
specializes
in
heartwarming
diner-style
dishes
.
I
'm
a
dedicated
omnivore
,
and
my
favorite
things
to
order
off
the
menu
were
the
Heathen
Vegan
Shoplifter
's
Delight
,
and
the
Zucchini
Potato
Pancakes
-LRB-
both
vegan
-RRB-
.
2
.
The
person
who
complained
about
the
terrible
service
...
I
have
no
idea
what
she
was
talking
about
.
In
the
4
years
I
lived
in
Madison
,
I
ate
there
on
an
average
of
once
a
month
,
and
my
servers
were
always
friendly
,
responsive
,
and
as
prompt
as
could
be
expected
during
varied
levels
of
busy-ness
.
3
.
The
cook
regularly
comes
out
to
chit-chat
and
joke
with
the
customers
.
It
's
always
a
treat
.
:-RRB-

.
They
work
hard
to
support
local
farmers
,
with
dedicated
local
and
organic
specials
featuring
produce
,
meats
and
dairy
from
area
growers
.
5
.
Their
homemade
biscuits
are
to
DIE
for
.
6
.
Try
the
pies
.
And
the
cakes
.
Do
it
.
If
you
ca
n't
eat
another
bite
,
take
a
slice
home
.
I
promise
,
you
wo
n't
regret
it
!
I
've
never
had
a
disappointing
meal
there
.
I
miss
it
like
a
long-lost
lover.One
of
our
favorite
Madison
restaurants
!
Great
food
-LRB-
most
of
the
time
-RRB-
and
fast
.
The
non-booth
side
feels
like
a
cafeteria
,
though
,
since
the
tables
are
so
close
together
.
Great
desserts
too!If
I
had
a
friend
from
overseas
come
to
visit
,
and
he
asked
me
to
show
him
what
good
American
food
was
like
,
I
know
without
a
doubt
this
would
be
the
place
that
I
would
display
to
him
with
great
national
pride
.
Actually
,
I
take
all
my
friends
who
come
to
visit
Madison
to
Monty
's
.
I
once
had
a
friend
visiting
who
was
on
a
very
strict
diet
-LRB-
gluten
free
+
fasting
for
lent
-RRB-
with
me
and
she
had
a
good
three
pages
of
vegetarian
and
gluten-free
menu
to
choose
from
.
This
should
n't
scare
off
those
looking
for
a
greasy
spoon
,
however
,
because
you
're
free
to
order
something
at
the
complete
opposite
of
that
spectrum
.
Bacon
grilled
cheese
,
donut
french
toast
,
chicken
fried
steak
,
alcoholic
milkshakes
...
You
name
it
,
they
probably
have
it
.
My
one
piece
of
advice
is
that
you
should
probably
look
at
the
menu
ahead
of
time
because
it
is
so
expansive
that
you
could
spend
as
much
as
a
half
hour
just
trying
to
make
up
your
mind
.
Be
prepared
to
wait
a
long
time
if
coming
in
during
the
weekend
brunch
rush
.
Do
not
be
deterred
,
it
is
completely
worth
every
second
.
For
what
it
's
worth
this
is
probably
my
#
1
favorite
restaurant
in
Madison
,
if
not
my
favorite
restaurant
ever.We
've
eaten
at
Monty
's
a
number
of
times
and
have
always
had
good
food
there
.
Service
has
also
been
good
to
excellent
.
The
veggie
quesadilla
is
quite
good
.
Their
prices
are
a
little
higher
than
we
would
like
.
Bathroom
and
restaurant
is
very
clean
.
When
we
are
in
the
mood
for
something
vegetarian
Monty
's
is
a
safe
bet
.
I
would
n't
really
say
I
'm
a
fan
but
they
do
enough
right
to
get
4
stars.Been
several
times
and
always
the
same
.
Fun
space
,
menu
reads
very
well
and
you
expect
to
get
a
great
meal
,
but
food
is
totally
plain
and
unexciting
.
All
hat
,
not
cattle
.
Do
n't
waste
the
time
or
money
,
many
better
options
around
town.I
'm
willing
to
shell
out
four
stars
.
I
have
not
yet
had
anything
bad
on
the
menu
.
The
atmosphere
is
always
pleasant
.
Sometimes
it
does
feel
,
however
,
that
the
wait
staff
pulls
preference
on
the
regulars
.
If
I
lived
in
the
area
it
would
be
a
constant
.
I
do
love
how
everything
served
is
local
.
The
milkshakes
are
so
close
to
being
the
best
in
the
area
.
So
close
.
The
pies
on
the
other
hand
...
Word
.
If
you
have
a
choice
to
make
for
eats
in
that
part
of
town
,
just
go
.
Take
it
all
in
and
be
satisfied
.
Also
,
plan
on
going
back.Not
great
but
not
bad
.
On
the
healthful
side
,
I
had
a
Mediterranean
platter
that
was
quite
tasty
.
It
had
hummus
,
quinoa
salad
and
pita
with
cucumber
salad
.
I
enjoyed
the
fact
that
while
this
is
something
of
an
old-fashioned
diner
,
my
choices
were
not
restricted
to
burgers
and
shakes
.
Although
they
do
have
shakes
.
Good
looking
ones
at
that
,
made
with
Sassy
Cow
ice
cream
.
I
opted
for
blueberry
pie
and
was
very
disappointed
.
The
blueberries
were
of
the
frozen
variety
and
sour
.
There
was
nothing
to
hold
them
together
,
so
they
fell
out
of
the
flavorless
crust
individually
.
I
was
glad
I
asked
for
it
a
la
mode
,
because
the
ice
cream
was
the
only
thing
that
saved
it
.
I
had
been
really
excited
by
the
variety
of
pies
and
cakes
at
the
counter
but
either
they
are
not
homemade
or
they
are
made
by
people
who
do
n't
like
to
bake
.
Either
way
,
I
would
not
order
pie
here
again
.
But
I
would
come
back
for
breakfast
all
day
or
some
of
the
other
menu
items
.
Fun
ambiance
,
particularly
for
kids
-LRB-
I
was
with
one
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
his
Mickey
Mouse
pancakes
!
-RRB-
...
Oh
,
and
they
have
booze.A
solid
diner
specializing
in
scratch-made
breakfasts
and
sandwiches
.
The
local
who
brought
be
here
said
that
Monty
's
tries
to
use
local
meats
,
veggies
,
etc.
and
I
applaud
that
-LRB-
especially
in
Wisconsin
where
all
the
local
stuff
is
typically
top-notch
-RRB-
.
I
tried
the
Wisconsin
salmon
breakfast
hash
that
was
tasty
and
I
cleaned
my
plate
,
but
the
dish
was
just
a
tad
dry
and
needed
a
little
something
extra
to
make
it
more
than
the
minced
and
griddled
sum
of
its
parts
.
Breakfast
potatoes
were
solid
and
did
n't
provoke
the
usual
request
for
Cholula/Tabasco
.
I
appreciated
the
fact
that
fresh
fruit
is
offered
as
a
side
with
most
breakfasts
.
Definitely
hit
the
spot
.
Our
server
was
very
attentive
and
was
exceedingly
patient
with
our
sleep-deprived
indecision
before
ordering
.
After
glancing
at
the
dessert
case
filled
with
ultra-decadent
delights
-LRB-
cupcakes
,
cakes
,
etc.
-RRB-
I
think
I
'd
be
up
for
returning
on
a
future
trip
to
Madison
.
A
late-night
sugar
fix
might
be
more
in
the
cards
than
breakfast
next
time
,
though.Food
,
decent
.
Service
,
eh
.
We
were
on
the
way
back
from
Chicago
and
decided
to
eat
in
Madison
.
I
found
Monty
's
online
so
we
checked
it
out
.
The
neighborhood
could
n't
be
cuter
.
It
was
noonish
on
a
Sunday
,
so
it
was
busy
.
We
waited
a
short
time
for
our
table
.
I
liked
how
the
person
cleaning
the
table
also
put
the
silverware
and
water
down
.
It
helps
turn
the
tables
over
quicker
and
it
satisfies
those
of
us
waiting
.
But
do
n't
drink
it
all
right
away
,
you
might
not
get
more
.
I
wanted
the
egg
sandwich
,
but
I
also
wanted
lunch
,
so
I
decided
on
the
Roast
Chicken
,
bacon
-LRB-
none
for
me
thanks
-RRB-
and
goat
cheese
sandwich
with
bean
salad
.
Dining
companion
had
the
Turkey
Club
with
bean
salad
.
Food
arrived
pretty
quick
and
my
sandwich
was
excellent
!
The
bread
was
toasted
perfectly
and
the
chicken
was
not
at
all
dry
and
the
smear
of
goat
cheese
was
great
.
My
dining
companion
liked
his
sandwich
was
well
.
The
bean
salad
could
double
as
a
chip
dip
,
in
fact
I
have
a
recipe
just
like
it
that
I
will
now
be
serving
as
salad
.
What
was
n't
great
was
the
service
.
The
food
got
dropped
off
and
she
never
came
back
.
She
was
going
to
bring
me
more
water
,
but
we
had
with
our
glasses
empty
the
WHOLE
time
we
were
eating
.
We
never
saw
her
again
.
We
took
out
our
credit
card
so
if
she
did
swing
by
she
could
take
it
and
we
could
go
.
If
it
were
n't
for
the
service
we
receive
I
would
consider
going
back.I
had
to
write
a
5-star
review
to
offset
some
of
the
poor
reviews
.
This
is
probably
the
best
restaraunt
in
Madison
for
vegetarians
.
Food
is
delicious
.
I
woud
n't
even
know
which
menu
item
to
review
;
everything
I
've
had
is
excellent
.
I
'd
like
to
see
where
some
of
these
other
reviewers
recommend
people
eat.I
always
try
and
get
here
at
least
once
when
I
go
to
Madison
.
The
food
is
always
good
.
I
love
the
tofu
scramble
.
A
great
mix
of
traditional
diner
food
with
some
great
healthy
alts.I
've
been
here
a
couple
times
.
The
food
is
outstanding
.

Ca
n't

ordered

and
I
sampled
it
all
.

If
you
have
poached
eggs
on
your
menu
and
do
not
know
how
to
poach
an
egg
do
NOT
offer
it
as
an
option
.
I
got
the
breakfast
item
with
spinach
,
mornay
sauce
,
and
poached
eggs
,
only
to
receive
hard
boiled
eggs
.
It
completely
ruined
the
dish
and
my
want
to
ever
come
back
.
Not
to
mention
that
the
food
is
always
mediocre
.
Not
happy
and
not
coming
back.How
have
I
never
written
a
review
for
Monty
's
?
Very
often
full
of
hipsters
as
well
as
old
ladies
having
pie
and
coffee
,
Monty
's
is
a
Madison
staple
.
A
long-time
fan
of
their
french
toast
,
I
recently
discovered
their
zucchini
and
potato
pancakes
.
While
I
expected
them
to
be
small
and
dense
like
latkes
,
they
were
really
more
the
size
and
shape
of
buttermilk
pancakes
.
So
much
food
!
But
really
good
.
While
I
personally
loathe
meatloaf
as
a
rule
,
my
sister
stands
by
their
meatloaf
and
meatloaf
sandwich
as
being
the
best
around
.
Always
popular
with
the
veggie/vegan
crowd
for
the
multitude
of
imitation
food
offerings
,
I
stick
with
the
bacon.Disregard
the
sniffy
reviews
by
food
snobs
;
Monty
's
is
great
at
being
what
it
is
,
a
nouveau
diner
with
an
eclectic
menu
,
welcoming
to
old
and
young
,
hipster
and
square
,
LGBT
and

Great
diner
--
breakfast
,
pie
,
milkshakes
?!
Always
a
good
experience
.
I
recommend
getting
the
breakfast
burrito
it
is
delicious.This
was
1
of
my
final
2
breakfasts
in
the
great
state
of
WI
as
I
am
leaving
for
Seattle
on
Wednesday
this
week
.
My
mother
and
I
came
here
on
her
request
to
go
someplace
new
before
I
left
town
.
I
had
not
been
here
myself
so
I
took
her
up
on
the
offer
.
Our
food
was
great
!
Good
service
,
great
coffee
,
fast
food
prep
from
order
to
plates
on
the
table
as
well
.
Had
a
decent
flow
of
people
coming
in
the
whole
morning
as
well
which
must
say
something
about
the
place
.
I
highly
suggest
the
sweet
potato
hash
for
breakfast
and
do
try
a
biscuit
or
2
as
well
,
great
with
some
honey
and
coffee
!
Great
prices
as
well.Here
's
a
lil
story
about
SWEET
potato
corned
beef
hash
.
Monty
's
will
make
it
for
you
if
you
ask
nicely
.
The
end
.
Alright
that
was
the
short
version
for
those
with
an
inability
to
read
more
than
a
few
lines
...
here
's
the
lengthier
more
tasty
version
!
After
having
some
lunchie
and
being
pleasantly
surprised
by
their
afternoon
eats
,
I
decided
it
was
time
to
give
MBPD
a
try
for
brekkie
.
Holy
options
batman
.
This
is
n't
your
typical
eggs
,
griddle
,
sausage
type
of
place
.
They
have
some
really
inspired
creations
,
and
it
was
hard
for
me
to
pick
between
two
.
The
corned
beef
hash
-LRB-
served
with
typical
white
potatoes
and
the
sweet
potato
hash
...
more
interesting
taters
but
no
meat
-RRB-
Hold
up
,
wait
a
minute
,
how
do
you
get
both
?
You
ask
nicely
.
Really
nicely
.
And
low
and
behold
moments
later
I
had
a
plate
of
blended
potato
perfection
and
some
chipped
meat
.
It
was
rad
.
Deliciously
rad
.
And
served
with
amazing
fruit
,
not
just
crappy
melon
as
is
typical
during
morning
meal
time
and
the
best
I
'M
TALKING
THE
BEST
biscuit
I
've
ever
eaten
.
And
I
'm
a
guy
who
's
had
a
few
biscuits
in
his
day
,
so
trust
.
Now
do
n't
going
running
over
there
saying
,
``
Corey
said
,
Corey
said
!
''
But
if
you
happen
to
get
a
nice
server
and
you
happen
to
strike
up
some
nice
conversation
nicely
ask
for
hot
tuber
take
on
their
standards
.
And
be
nice
if
they
charge
you
a
little
more
.
They
're
combining
two
dishes
to
make
you
happy
after
all
.
Nice.Stopped
in
this
morning
for
breakfast
and
pie
.
They
make
great
corned
beef
hash
and
home
fries
.
The
meat
is
hand
cut
from
locally
sourced
beef
,
and
all
the
ingredients
are
fresh
and
tasty
.
For
pie
my
server
Kim
surprised
me
with
strawberry
rhubarb
ala
mode
.
Again
fresh
and
delightful
.
Monty
's
offers
fantastic
diner
food
and
a
wide
range
of
fruit
and
cream
pies
.
You
ca
n't
go
wrong
here.Monty
's
Blue
Plate
and
the
Holy
Grail
of
Corned
Beef
Hash
.
If
I
were
to
write
nothing
else
,
I
think
the
previous
sentence
sums
up
my
new
found
appreciation
for
the
place
.
``
Your
mother
was
a
hamster
,
and
your
father
smelled
of
elderberries
''
will
never
be
uttered
to
an
employee
of
Monty
's
.
The
service
was
great
,
my
coffee
cup
stayed
full
the
entire
meal
,
and
the
food
was
`
da
bomb
.
'
I
'm
eyeballing
the
Chorizo
for
my
next
visit
,
which
will
be
sooner
rather
than
later.Monty
's
has
quickly
become
my
``
can
you
''
place
.
What
do
I
mean
by
that
...
``
You
know
your
chocolate
malt
pie
...
can
you
turn
that
into
a
shake
?
''
YES
``
You
know
the
fried
onions
that
come
on
the
open
faced
meatloaf
sandwich
...
can
you
put
those
on
a
burger
?
''
YES
``
You
know
the
biscuit
that
comes
with
some
breakfast
items
...
can
I
swap
my
diner
roll
for
a
biscuit
?
''
YES
The
staff
is
extremely
friendly
,
always
up
for
great
conversation
and
recently
I
've
taken
to
sitting
at
the
counter
which
is
a
blast
...
your
meal
comes
with
a
free
show
!
So
when
I
say
Monty
's
is
my
``
can
you
''
place
,
I
mean
it
's
a
place
that
does
n't
mind
me
being
a
brat
.
And
if
they
ever
say
no
?
That
'll
be
ok
with
me
.
I
may
go
once
a
week
instead
of
my
typical
3-4
-LRB-
seriously
how
does
that
happen
?
-RRB-
but
I
'll
still
go!I
had
attempted
to
go
to
Monty
's
Blue
Plate
Diner
the
last
time
I
was
in
town
,
but
it
was
so
crowded
that
I
was
deterred
and
ended
up
at
Ella
's
Deli
for
possibly
the
worst
omelet
of
my
life
.
This
time
,
I
was
determined
to
wait
it
out
at
Monty
's
for
as
long
as
it
took
-
which
ended
up
being
only
ten
minutes
at
around
11:30
a.m.
on
a
Sunday
.
The
wait
was
well
worth
every
second
.
My
breakfast
companion
and
I
had
the
meatless
meatloaf
-
a
melange
of
carrots
and
other
vegetables
,
covered
in
a
cashew
and
sage
gravy
-
and
a
caponata
omelet
,
filled
with
a
stew
of
perfectly-cooked
,
still-easily-recognizable
vegetables
and
a
pesto
sauce
made
from
basil
grown
out
back
.
Each
bite
of
each
dish
was
a
delight
.
I
took
home
a
slice
of
Reese
's
peanut
butter
cheesecake
which
I
am
hoping
my
son
will
find
to
be
too
rich
for
him
because
,
uh
huh
!
That
means
I
get
to
polish
it
off
.
Ca
n't
wait
to
get
back
to
Madison
for
another
go-round
at
Monty
's
!
Always
loved
this
place
,
but
last
time
we
tried
it
had
a
terrible
experience
.
Wanted
to
order
fish
and
was
told
they
no
longer
served
it
.
About
5
minutes
later
the
same
waitress
brings
out
a
huge
fish
plate
for
the
lady
next
to
us
.
We
are
like
''
What
the
HECK
''
????
Needless
to
say
if
we
are
not
good
enough
to
eat
what
anyone
else
gets
,
then
we
are
taking
our
business
else
where
.
The
food
that
we
got
was
not
that
great
this
time
anyway.A
diner
with
Food
Fight
style
and
warm
service
is
my
go-to
for
breakfast
all
day
.
Beloved
:
corned
beef
hash
,
TNT
BLT
,
waffle
fries
.
A
year
and
a
half
of
regular
visits
has
revealed
the
staff
to
be
consistently
friendly
and
efficient
,
food
quality
to
be
consistently
high
and
prices
to
be
reasonable
.
Monty
's
is
worth
the
occasional
short
wait
for
a
table.The
great
thing
about
this
diner
is
the
diversity
of
the
menu
.
There
's
tons
of
options
to
choose
from
so
it
's
hard
not
to
find
something
that
you
like
.
I
'm
guessing
that
it
was
just
a
fluke
,
but
my
biggest
complaint
was
that
the
diner
was
cold
!
It
was
colder
inside
than
it
was
outside
.
My
wife
and
I
-LRB-
the
people
at
the
tables
around
us
-RRB-
had
to
wear
our
jackets
the
whole
time
.
I
had
to
scarf
down
my
food
,
only
couple
minutes
after
arriving
at
the
table
it
was
already
getting
cold
.
I
ordered
the
Wisconsin
Salmon
Hash
and
it
was
pretty
good
.
I
was
expecting
a
nice
fillet
of
fish
with
my
hash
,
but
the
salmon
was
pretty
skimpy
.
Small
pieces
scattered
throughout
.
It
came
with
some
pineapple
,
melon
and
a
biscuit
.
The
fruit
was
fresh
and
complimented
the
hash
well
.
The
biscuit
was
n't
bad
but
would
have
been
much
better
if
it
had
been
served
warm.I
love
diners
.
I
love
Monty
's
.
I
especially
love
the
pie
porn
lingering
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
so
you
can
just
gaze
with
wonder
as
you
wait
for
your
cibo
.
I
ordered
the
Italian
grilled
cheese
which
had
an
exorbitant
amount
of
cheese
.
Seriously
could
have
served
a
whole
Italian
family
,
that
's
how
much
mozzarella
was
squished
in
there
.
Tasty
?
Hell
yes
.
Alcohol
is
offered
,
wine
and
beer
galore
.
Woohoo!One
of
my
favorite
breakfast
places
in
Madison
.
The
salmon
hash
is
a
dream
.
And
Tim
bakes
the
best
biscuits
in
town!NEVER
had
a
bad
meal
at
Blue
Plate
.
Great
for
any
meal
of
the
day
.
Service
always
good
whether
you
are
at
a
table
,
at
the
counter
,
or
outside
on
the
patio
.
Plenty
of
vegan
and
gluten
free
choices.I
have
only
good
things
to
say
about
Monty
's
!
If
you
like
unpretentious
food
that
is
filled
to
the
brim
with
flavor
you
will
also
like
Monty
's
.
We
had
the
meatloaf
and
chicken
in
a
pie
at
our
table
.
I
think
I
said
``
yumm
''
no
less
than
9
times
...
really
it
could
n't
be
helped
!
The
turtle
cheesecake
I
got
to
go
was
also
pretty
spectacular
.
I
appreciated
the
service
as
well
.
Our
server
was
friendly
and
available
without
being
overbearing
.
It
was
the
perfect
dinner
.5
starts
for
being
one
of
the
few
places
I
have
ever
been
that
has
full
on
,
decked
out
vegan
breakfasts
!
No
wimpy
smoothies
or
oatmeal
here
.
I
'm
talking
tofu
scramble
and
vegan
hash
.
I
'm
in
love
...
I
can
definitely
see
the
appeal
of
Monty
's
.
This
delicious
and
clean
diner
serves
up
some
tasty
eats
with
a
twist
.
It
did
n't
take
long
for
my
buddy
Corey
D
to
share
his
love
and
thus
I
had
to
experience
it
for
myself
.
If
you
're
not
carrying
a
child
,
you
must
sample
their
drink
menu
.
Looks
super
fantastic
.
Please
have
one
for
me
.
But
beyond
the
cornucopia
of
boozy
beverages
lie
various
menus
that
will
satisfy
just
about
every
craving
.
Sweet
,
savory
,
both
...
take
your
pick
.
During
my
visit
,
I
sample
the
hash
...
but
due
to
Corey
's
insight
,
I
kindly
asked
if
they
could
make
my
plate
half
sweet
potato
hash
and
half
corned
beef
hash
.
Yes
they
can
,
and
yes
they
did
.
The
hash
was
nicely
crisped
and
the
corned
beef
perfectly
salty
.
Portions
were
sizable
without
being
gigantic
,
and
honestly
,
I
kind
of
appreciate
that
.
No
one
needs
to
start
their
day
with
6
pounds
of
corned
beef
hash
.
Yikes
.
The
sizes
were
just
fine
-
I
appreciate
the
substitution
of
fruit
.
Got
ta
add
some
healthy
in
your
meal
!
My
main
gripe
is
for
their
biscuits
.
Mine
was
uber
dry
and
crumbly
.
Bummer
on
the
biscuit
,
but
I
'm
sure
I
'll
manage
.
Next
time
I
make
it
up
to
Madison
,
I
'd
happily
swing
back
into
Monty
's
for
another
scrumptious
breakfast.Maybe
I
'm
jumping
the
gun
with
a
5
star
review
...
oh
well
,
life
's
short
.
I
tried
this
place
for
the
first
time
the
other
week
when
my
grandparents
were
visiting
me
in
Madison
.
It
was
just
wonderful
!
The
decor
is
adorable
,
the
servers
were
friendly
and
prompt
,
and
the
food
was
fabulous
.
I
went
with
the
Heathen
Vegan
Sandwich
,
which
is
piled
high
with
mushrooms
,
tempeh
,
and
avocado
.
For
my
side
,
I
chose
the
bean
salad
.
Both
of
these
items
were
delicious
.
The
sandwich
was
HUGE
.
I
could
not
eat
it
like
a
regular
sandwich
,
so
I
ate
it
in
an
open-faced
sort
of
way
with
a
fork
.
A
little
messy
,
but
totally
worth
it
.
The
mushrooms
and
tempeh
were
perfectly
seasoned
and
tender
and
the
avocado
brought
it
all
together
with
the
toasted
bread
.
I
got
a
bit
nervous
because
at
the
*
very
last
second
*
my
grandma
changed
her
order
to
the
exact
same
thing
I
got
-LRB-
she
's
not
vegan
-RRB-
because
she
``
trusts
me
''
.
I
was
pretty
nervous
,
but
she
ended
up
loving
it
!
I
was
so
pleased
.
My
one
complaint
might
be
that
my
bean
salad
had
a
bit
too
much
dressing
on
it
,
but
my
grandma
's
did
not
share
that
problem
and
it
was
n't
difficult
to
just
eat
it
with
a
fork
instead
of
a
spoon
.
My
grandpa
ordered
some
sort
of
breakfast
platter
and
was
very
pleased
.
He
basically
always
orders
the
same
thing
at
diners
-
two
poached
eggs
,
bacon
,
potatoes
,
and
toast
,
so
if
he
is
impressed
I
feel
that
it
is
a
good
sign
.
He
said
the
eggs
were
cooked
perfectly
.
They
seem
extremely
accommodating
for
allergies
and
preferences
as
well
,
which
is
always
a
huge
plus
.
Overall
,
I
was
very
happy
with
my
first
visit
to
Monty
's
.
Not
only
because
I
loved
my
vegan
options
,
but
because
you
made
my
grandparents
very
happy
too
and
that
rocks
in
my
book
.
I
will
definitely
be
back!Part
of
the
Madison
based

16
restaurants
currently
?
-RRB-
,
Monty
's
was
the
first
,
or
one
of
the
first
.
They
are
all
different
,
yet
are
the
same
in
one
way
.
They
are
good
places
to
eat
.
Monty
's
is
styled
after
a
50
's
diner
-
counter
,
chrome
,
lots
of
``
traditional
''
diner
foods
,
and
a
lot
that
you
never
got
at
a
diner
.
Service
is
fast
,
food
is
good
,
prices
are
reasonable
-LRB-
but
not
cheap
-RRB-
and
wait
staff
is
friendly
.
Feels
neighborhood
friendly
,
although
they
bring
in
people
from
all
over
the
area
.
Plenty
of
good
vegetarian
options
also
.
Food
is
interesting
,
with
lots
of
things
not
found
in
your
typical
diner
.
Coffee
is
from
Just
Coffee
-LRB-
that
is
a
bonus
feature
people
-
if
you
like
coffee
,
this
is
a
great
place
-RRB-
and
many
of
the
specials
are
made
with
organic
foods
.
Want
a
burger
but
do
n't
eat
meat
?
Swap
out
the
Walnut
burger
-
which
,
as
a
meat
eater
,
I
can
say
is
good
.
Certainly
better
than
their
hamburger
.
Speaking
of
which
...
What
is
up
with
that
hamburger
?
First
off
,
it
comes
medium
well
done
-
no
burger
should
ever
be
cooked
to
that
.
Second
,
it
is
heavily
,
and
funky
seasoned
.
As
in
,
if
I
ordered
it
,
it
would
go
back
.
A
good
burger
needs
salt
and
pepper
.
They
add
a
bunch
of
stuff
.
However
my
niece
who
ordered
it
liked
it
,
so
we
kept
it
.
Deserts
are
very
popular
at
Monty
's
,
but
that
was
our
disappointment
.
Cheesecake
was
rubbery
and
the
carrot
cake
was
dry
-
stale
dry
.
Really
?
I
am
almost
tempted
to
go
to
three
stars
just
for
that
.
Overall
,
I
have
to
stick
with
four
stars
.
Great
coffee
,
mostly
really
good
,
and
interesting
,
food
,
fast
,
good
service
.
Without
a
doubt
I
will
be
back
if
in
the
area
.
But
I
will
skip
desert.good
breakfast
!!
good
service
!!
good
place
if
your
in
MadisonEverything
I
have
ever
tried
here
is
delicious
!
The
cupcakes
are
to
die
for!I
've
eaten
at
Monty
's
probably
3
dozen
times
over
the
past
two
years
and
I
've
noticed
that
while
the
quality
of
ingredients
remains
high
,
the
preparation
consistency
is
low
.
One
of
my
favorite
items
is
their
breakfast
potatoes
and
sometimes
they
're
perfect
but
often
they
are
either
raw
or
burnt
.
Today
I
ordered
a
breakfast
sandwich
and
specified
the
egg
over
hard
...
it
was
almost
raw
.
The
service
is
also
hit
or
miss
.
Some
servers
are
EXCELLENT
,
but
there
's
this
gay
guy
there
that
is
just
BAD
.
He
's
stuck
up
,
does
n't
refill
coffee
-LRB-
i
literally
had
to
get
up
and
get
our
own
-RRB-
,
and
did
n't
'
even
bother
to
give
a
damn
when
my
wife
mentioned
that
the
zucchini
pancakes
were
bad
-LRB-
they
were
gross
-RRB-
.
I
'm
done
with
Monty
's
.
There
's
plenty
of
good
breakfast
places
in
Madison
to
give
my
money
to.Food
was
delicious
.
A
touch
pricey
for
a
``
diner
''
but
worth
it
one
we
were
eating
.
Service
was
good
too
,
even
when
my
daughter
went
into
meltdown
mode
because
she
did
n't
want
to
leave.I
've
been
in
Madison
for
16
years
,
and
this
is
my
favorite
Madison
restaurant
,
bar
none.One
of
my
favorite
places
to
eat
.
Zucchini
Pancakes
are
awesome
!!!
We
mostly
eat
breakfast
here
but
I
'm
sure
lunch
and
dinner
are
just
as
good.Little
cramped
seating
for
four
but
the
food
makes
up
for
any
seating
issue.What
an
eclectic
menu
for
a
diner
!
The
ambiance
is
just
what
you
would
expect
from
a
classic
60
's
diner
.
I
had
a
ruben
and
some
fries
and
it
was
really
good
!
Most
places
use
processed
corned
beef
.
Theirs
was
real
sliced
beef
...
very
tender
and
very
flavorful
.
Probably
the
best
ruben
I
have
ever
had
.
I
had
to
try
the
pie
too
since
they
tease
you
with
a
great
display
right
when
you
walk
in
.
The
French
silk
was
really
rich
and
chocolaty
.
Definately
worth
the
stop
if
you
are
in
the
area
or
passing
through.Monday
is
hard
for
everyone
.
So
if
you
ever
come
home
from
work
disoriented
-LRB-
cuz
it
's
Monday
-RRB-
,
Monty
's
there
for
you
to
take
a
good
care
of
your
Monday
night
meal
.
My
bf
and
I
had
fantastic
vegan
`
breakfast
for
dinner
'
spread
last
night
.
The
hash
with
tofu
scambles
+
waffle
fries
.
It
was
good
,
unexpectedly
fabulous
.
The
portion
size
is
generous
.
I
took
home
the
left
overs
and
lunching
on
it
as
I
write
this
review
.
Bonus
.
Monty
's
fruits
pies
are
all
vegan
-LRB-
i
did
n't
know
this
-RRB-
.
Pies
are
so-so
for
my
taste
,
but
not
bad.Walnut
Burger
is
the
way
to
go
.
.
Their
bean
salad
as
a
side
option
is
Delish
.
Not
expensive
,
long
waits
on
weekends
in
the
mornings
but
worth
it.Visited
with
my
family
for
first
time
.
I
have
vegan
diet
and
they
do
n't
,
but
we
ALL
enjoyed
our
meals
.
Will
be
back!I
love
that
this
diner
offers
vegetarian/vegan
options
.
Perfect
for
me
and
my
omnivore
hubby
.
Our
waitress
was
great
,
too.Yummy
sweet
potato
hash
,
yummy
eggs
.
Biscuits
are
decent
!
Boyfriend
was
happy
with
his
meal
as
well
-LRB-
simple
eggs
,
bacon
,
potatoes
,
etc.
-RRB-
Service
was
quick
and
friendly.This
place
is
overall
fantastic
.
There
is
a
hip
diner
atmosphere
,
the
servers
are
always
very
attentive
,
and
there
are
so
many
options
for
food
!
There
are
several
vegetarian
and
vegan
options
,
for
both
breakfast
and
lunch/dinner
.
If
you
are
-LRB-
or
are
n't
!
-RRB-
a
vegetarian
,
try
the
Vegetarian
Hash
or
the
Meatless
Loaf
of
the
Gods
.
Both
are
insanely
tasty
and
huge!Lots
of
good
vegan
and
vegetarian
options
if
you
're
in
the
mood
for
diner
food
.
It
can
get
really
busy
here
on
the
weekends
,
so
it
's
best
to
go
at
off-peak
times
.
Also
,
your
phone
wo
n't
get
service
inside
their
building.Looking
for
a
big
,
hearty
breakfast
?
Then
look
no
further
because
this
place
has
got
exactly
what
you
're
looking
for
-LRB-
and
for
a
pretty
reasonable
price
-RRB-
.
I
went
here
with
my
friend
after
a
night
of
*
ahem
*
good
old
Madison
weekend
fun
,
and
this
was
exactly
what
we
needed
.
I
got
the
eggs
mornay
,
which
has
this
sausage
patty
and
poached
eggs
with
this
very
nice
sauce
on
top
of
an
English
muffin
.
And
if
that
was
n't
enough
carbs
for
you
,
it
comes
with
a
generous
helping
of
fried
potatoes
.
Good
stuff
.
Also
a
random
note
:
despite
its
appearance
as
an
old
fashioned
diner
,
I
got
a
very
hipster-y
vibe
from
it
once
I
got
in.I
'm
sad
to
say
that
after
a
really
great
first
experience
over
one
year
ago
,
Friday
night
's
dinner
at
Monty
's
was
very
disappointing
and
I
probably
wo
n't
come
back
any
time
soon
.
The
host
at
the
counter
was
not
friendly
.
My
sandwich
came
on
bread
that
was
literally
hard
as
a
rock
and
then
my
husband
was
done
eating
before
I
even
started
my
dinner
because
I
sent
it
back
and
waited
for
new
bread
.
The
bread
the
second
time
around
was
greasy
and
the
sandwich
itself
was
dripping
in
grease
.
GROSS
.
My
husband
ordered
the
fish
fry
and
they
forgot
part
of
his
order
.
It
was
just
a
bad
day
for
Monty
's
...
I
might
be
back
for
dessert
someday.My
wife
and
i
love
this
place
for
lunch
or
dinner
.
Not
so
awesome
on
the
breakfast
end
unfortunately
.
But
there
's
a
great
selection
for
vegans
and
vegitarians
alike
.
Our
favorite
is
the
Heathan
Vegan
.
One
of
the
best
sandwiches
ever
!
And
that
it
's
served
with
waffle
fries
makes
it
only
more
appealing
.
The
veggie
meatloaf
is
also
fantastic
as
is
the
gravy
that
's
served
on
it
.
Service
can
be
a
bit
iffy
at
times
.
But
the
one
time
it
was
so
terrible
for
us
we
ended
up
complaining
we
got
a
$
25
``
we
're
sorry
''
coupon
.
Not
bad
.
Over
all
though
you
ca
n't
go
wrong
at
Monty
's
.
Great
food
,
GREAT
service
.
Highly
recommend!This
place
is
always
excellent
.
I
've
never
left
unhappy
.
Even
amongst
so
many
good
offerings
in
Madison
,
this
diner
stands
out
.
Plan
your
arrival
carefully
though
,
as
there
is
often
a
long
wait
for
tables.Great
diner
with
a
very
creative
menu
.
You
can
certainly
get
your
traditional
eggs-and-bacon
breakfast
,
or
you
can
opt
for
a
tofu
scramble
or
zucchini
potato
pancakes
.
What
more
could
you
ask
for
?
I
have
only
eaten
here
for
breakfast
,
but
the
desserts
are
tempting
,
too.Funky
50
's
vibe
...
Staff
was
excellent
and
educated
on
ingredients
and
choices
.
Really
the
some
of
the
best
food
I
've
had
in
Madison
at
a
veryy
reasonable
price.The
Vegetarian
Hash
is
a
must
have
!
Hits
:
Tasty
food
,
happy
servers
,
bakery
case
,
and
custom
blended
coffee
.
Misses
:
Static
menu
...
but
there
are
specials
and
it
is
an
iconic
location
so
maybe
things
should
n't
change
.
Hints
:
Have
a
cup
of
free
coffee
and
enjoy
some
social
time
with
friends
while
you
wait
for
a
table
.
Bottom-line
:
Eat
,
drink
good
coffee
,
and
be
merry.Stopped
here
for
dinner
before
going
out
.
Our
server
was
friendly
and
efficient
.
The
50
's
diner
motif
was
cute
.
Tons
of
vegetarian
and
gluten
free
options
if
you
're
into
that
sort
of
thing
.
I
had
the
roasted
turkey
club
and
it
was
tasty
.
Awesome
dessert
options
too
so
save
room!Have
to
add
my
voice
to
the
chorus
of
MBP
lovers
.
I
somehow
missed
this
place
in
the
many
times
I
've
been
to
Madison
until
a
few
years
ago
.
Great
food
,
lots
of
vegetarian
and
vegan
options
.
They
have
breakfast
all
day
and
quite
a
few
hot
veggie
sandwiches
.
I
finished
my
meal
with
banana
cream
pie
,
but
they
have
vegan
fruit
pies
and
ice
cream
treats.I
had
something
to
celebrate
and
had
n't
been
able
to
eat
meat
since
watching
a
food
documentary
a
few
weeks
prior
,
so
Monty
's
seemed
like
the
appropriate
celebratory
location
.
I
ordered
their
special
:
teriyaki
tofu
with
peas
,
coconut
,
peppers
and
peanuts
,
served
with
a
side
of
fresh
pita
.
The
description
was
a
little
clunky
--
there
were
other
ingredients
in
the
dish
description
that
I
've
since
forgotten
--
and
I
got
a
kick
out
of
listening
to
the
waitress
explain
it
to
other
patrons
.
During
a
short
wait
,
I
sipped
a
heavenly
hot
chocolate
.
My
husband
is
n't
a
hot
chocolate
fan
but
agreed
that
it
was
really
,
really
good
.
FYI
:
they
'll
make
it
with
soy
milk
if
you
ask
.
After
the
food
arrived
it
took
me
two
seconds
to
realize
that
the
tofu
was
the
best
I
'd
ever
tasted
.
Tender
,
flavorful
,
caramelized
on
the
outside
.
The
sauce
was
a
little
saltier
than
I
prefer
,
but
still
quite
good
.
The
pita
had
good
texture
and
a
nice
,
buttery
taste
.
My
husband
enjoyed
the
traditional-type
burger
he
ordered
.
Our
only
disappointment
is
that
we
did
n't
save
room
for
dessert
.
Other
observations
:
-
Going
early
helped
avoid
parking
lot
anxiety
--
they
get
Busy
here
.
-
Our
red-haired
waitress
was
friendly
,
intelligent
,
and
overall
awesome
.
Noting
that
I
had
ordered
soy
milk
hot
chocolate
,
she
advised
that
the
teriyaki
tofu
meal
is
prepared
with
a
small
amount
of
dairy
.
-
Staff
brought
water
to
a
puppy
who
was
sitting
outside
with
his
humans.I
recently
visited
Monty
's
and
had
the
roasted
vegetable
salad
which
came
with
quinoa
in
a
lemon
vinegarette
dressing
.
I
loved
all
the
different
textures
-LRB-
chewy
quinoa
and
crunchy
sunflower
seeds
-RRB-
but
it
was
a
little
heavily
dressed
.
On
my
way
out
I
got
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
,
and
it
was
kind
I
disappointing
:
dry
and
crumbly
.
Luckily
there
were
lots
of
chocolate
chips
in
it
,
so
it
did
n't
go
to
waste
!
Overall
Monty
's
has
food
that
is
consistently
good
,
fast
service
once
seated
-LRB-
however
I
was
there
for
lunch
on
a
Tuesday
-RRB-
,
and
reasonable
prices.So
,
it
's
not
like
this
place
was
ever
gon
na
make
it
outta
my
e-gutter
,
cuz
there
's
nothing
really
redeeming
about
it
.
You
know
,
sometimes
a
craving
makes
one
act
desperately
...
sometimes
against
one
's
better
knowledge
.
Nevertheless
,
I
make
my
way
to
Monty
's
one
fine
day
,
craving
some
sort
of
ice-cream
based
treat
,
similar
to
a
beverage
,
but
of
a
thicker
consistency
.
Nothing
special
,
just
some
plain
old
ice
cream
and
say
,
caramel
.
It
was
$
6.38
?!
Okay
,
so
I
go
into
a
Vincent
Vega
state
of
mind
,
zoning
out
while
the
shake
's
bein
'
made
thinking
to
myself
``
Did
I
just
order
a
six-dollars
n
'
38
cent
shake
?
Sure
did
.
A
shake
?
Milk
,
ice
cream
,
caramel
?
Uh-huh
.
Six-dollars
n
'
38
cents
?
Yep
.
They
do
n't
put
bourbon
in
it
or
anything
?
Nope
.
Just
checking
...
smh
...
Whoa
,
WHAT
?!
When
it
came
up
,
it
was
in
a
small
,
flimsy
styro
cup
,
with
a
sad
lil
'
wafer
sticking
out
the
top
.
Wait
...
did
they
just
charge
me
like
that
much
for
this
???
Ugh
!
I
was
so
pissed
,
I
told
em
'
keep
it
,
n
'
got
my
money
back
.
I
can
get
Culver
's
or
Michael
's
for
like
,
way
better
...
Even
the
Chocolate
Shoppe
,
or
like
,
buy
your
own
pint
and
a
gallon
of
milk
,
stir
in
some
Smucker
's
flavoring
and
have
change
to
spare
...
I
do
n't
even
know
why
people
like
this
place
.
Dude
,
seriously
...
Abundant
vegan
options
,
even
for
breakfast
!
Food
is
above
average
,
service
was
great
,
prices
really
low
.
The
sweet
potato
hash
with
tofu
scramble
was
especially
good.Their
banana
pie
and
carrot
cake
are
SUPER
!!!!!!!
and
if
you
happen
to
buy
the
whole
container
,
you
are
required
to
give
a
5-dollar
deposit
which
will
be
returned
if
you
bring
it
back
.
Oh
Monty
,
finally
!
This
morning
,
though
I
am
still
a
little
bit
ill
,
I
came
only
for
you
:-RRB-
-LRB-
and
for
me
:-RRB-
-RRB-
Waiting
for
less
than
10
minutes
,
we
were
seated
by
the
window
.
A
very
nice
spot
.
I
decided
quickly
:
I
wanted
to
have
a
dish
of
scramble
``
something
''
-LRB-
hahaha
,
I
found
this
funny
,
I
was
wondering
what
``
something
''
meant
.
I
asked
the
server
and
she
said
it
is
for
broccoli
,
pepper
,
some
cheese
-LRB-
and
God
knows
what
else
!
--
too
many
to
list
!
:D
-RRB-
and
has
no
meat
-LRB-
yay
!
-RRB-
Hubby
ordered
a
dish
of
pesto
omelet
!
Both
came
with
homemade
biscuit
-
I
'm
in
love
with
this
biscuit
right
away
!
We
enjoyed
our
brunch
soooooooooooo
much
.
I
told
the
waiter
:
The
food
is
excellent
!
I
wan
na
come
back
soon
!
The
food
is
a
five
.
The
service
is
a
five
.
Yes
,
full
score
for
you
,
Monty
.
Sshhhhh
,
do
n't
forget
to
also
order
their
coffee
and
the
donut
.
The
coffee
is
really
an
eye
opener
and
the
donut
is
ridiculously
huge
but
so
GOOD
.
Monty
has
made
my
Saturday
happy
!
and
I
really
need
that
after
one
week
of
my
illness
:-LRB-
Mahalo
,
Monty!I
do
n't
understand
why
this
place
is
popular
.
The
food
was
bad
and
the
service
was
bad
.
I
ordered
a
burger
medium
well
and
got
it
medium
rare
.
After
sending
it
back
and
getting
another
it
was
still
medium/medium
rare
but
I
was
too
hungry
to
send
it
back
again
and
lost
all
faith
in
their
cooks
.
I
think
they
served
it
on
the
same
plate
with
the
same
cold
fries
as
before
.
My
friend
ordered
a
breakfast
dish
and
it
was
terrible
.
The
scrambled
eggs
were
so
overcooked
they
were
hard
and
rubbery
,
the
potatoes
were
very
undercooked
,
and
the
biscuit
was
dry
and
literally
had
no
flavor
.
None
.
The
service
seriously
lacked
as
well
.
No
one
was
unfriendly
,
just
incompetent
.
We
thought
the
dessert
would
redeem
them
but
after
paying
so
much
for
a
single
slice
of
cheesecake
we
could
n't
even
finish
it
.
One
slice
was
dried
out
and
the
other
cheesecake
had
too
much
sour
cream
-
it
was
actually
mushy
and
very
sour
,
almost
spoiled
tasting
.
Bottom
line
,
I
found
this
place
to
be
mediocre
at
best
,
and
that
's
being
generous
.
There
's
tons
of
better
restaurants
in
the
area
and
in
the
city
.
Never
going
back
,
and
I
think
the
food
has
made
me
ill.Blue
plate
omelette
was
delish
,
with
avocado
,
pan
fried
potatoes
and
homemade
biscuits
.
We
also
had
the
almond
milk
French
toast
.
To
top
it
off
,
local
coffee
,
ground
fresh
with
each
pot
!
Must
stop
again.I
have
been
going
here
since
the
90s
and
it
has
been
up
and
down
.
Some
ok
food
,
some
terrible
.
Once
found
fatty
masses
in
my
meatloaf
.
Recently
it
has
been
just
ok
.
Inexpensive
,
pretty
fast
but
low
quality
compared
to
other
places
on
Willy
street
and
mediocre
compared
to
the
many
good
options
in
Madison.I
had
a
wonderful
experience
at
Monty
's
.
My
server
was
incredibly
kind
,
attentive
,
and
friendly
.
He
could
not
have
had
a
more
pleasant
demeanor
.
The
food
was
also
quite
good
,
and
the
prices
are
great
.
I
ordered
the
breakfast
burrito
and
enjoyed
it
very
much
.
I
would
definitely
go
back
to
Monty
`
sI
cry
sad
tears
at
night
now
that
I
can
no
longer
get
crispy
fried
onions
or
a
meat
loaf
sammie
.
You
know
what
helps
me
sleep
,
though
?
Salmon
hash
.
It
's
so
inspirational
I
re-created
the
dish
this
weekend
.
3
times
.
For
different
people
.
-LRB-
It
's
that
good
.
-RRB-
Fabulous
,
just
fabulous
.
Service
is
spectacular
and
food
is
beyond
amazing
.
The
wait
was
awhile
,
maybe
half
an
hour
or
so
but
totally
worth
it
.
The
breakfast
burrito
,
salmon
hash
and
potato
and
zucchini
pancakes
are
delectable.The
food
was
ok
!
Prices
were
reasonable
.
I
got
the
almond
French
toast
.
It
was
simple
,
came
with
a
side
of
fruits
.
Coffee
was
really
strong
and
just
what
I
needed
for
the
morning
.
My
boy
friend
got
the
steak
hash
.
It
was
alright
for
the
price
,
nothing
special
!
Would
I
come
back
for
breakfast
?
Nope!It
's
unique
diner
food
in
a
renovated
old
gas
station
.
They
have
lots
of
vegetarian
options
and
a
fantastic
bakery!Meatloaf
with
red
wine
gravy
and
amazing
mashed
potatoes
,
followed
by
the
best
bumbleberry
pie
ever
.
Best
place
for
comfort
food
.
Did
I
mention
the
pie
??
We
stopped
here
on
a
road
trip
from
Minneapolis
to
Chicago
.
So
glad
we
did
.
The
meatloaf
was
the
best
ever.Going
to
see
a
show
or
concert
across
the
street
at
the
Barrymore
?
Well
,
we
all
have
to
eat
somewhere
,
why
not
Monty
's
?
The
first
time
I
laid
eyes
on
this
joint
,
it
was
a
few
weeks
ago
after
skipping
dinner
and
going
to
Bo
Burnham
.
I
wondered
if
it
was
a
bar
or
a
restaurant
,
a
week
later
,
I
found
out
that
it
's
kind
of
both
!
It
's
a
classic
diner
that
happens
to
serve
alcohol
.
I
ordered
and
enjoyed
the
mushroom
and
swiss
,
but
I
came
in
on
a
mission
.
To
order
a
burger
.
Their
menu
almost
distracted
me
from
my
mission
by
offering
breakfast
all
day
.
Oh
,
I
shall
return
to
conquer
the
idea
of
Breakfast
for
Dinner
another
time
!
Waffle
fries
!
need
I
say
more
on
this
topic
?
Well
,
its
Yelp
,
so
yes
.
Just
the
right
amount
of
crispy
and
not
too
many
.
I
also
managed
a
dessert
on
my
first
visit
,
that
portion
size
of
the
Oat
Fudge
Bar
was
enough
for
me
to
have
skipped
the
fries
or
the
burger
,
it
was
huge
!
Sadly
there
were
nuts
mixed
in
-LRB-
personal
preference
-RRB-
,
but
that
did
n't
stop
me
.
I
did
n't
opt-in
for
a
shake
,
but
I
should
have
.
All
I
've
learned
about
my
visit
is
that
I
will
have
to
make
another
trip
before
my
next
Barrymore
concert!Descriptive
phrase
:
quaint
,
local
diner
.
Monty
's
Blue
Plate
Diner
is
located
in
a
quiet
but
neat
part
of
East
Madison
,
not
far
off
Willy
Street
.
It
looks
like
an
old
gas
station
-LRB-
could
be
-RRB-
,
and
there
was
a
25
minute
wait
for
Saturday
brunch
when
we
came
.
There
's
space
to
sit
outside
,
or
shops
nearby
to
wander
to
.
Inside
it
's
classic
diner
,
through
and
through
.
We
-LRB-
4
of
us
-RRB-
were
seated
at
a
small
booth
.
It
was
cozy
to
say
the
least
.
Katie
K.
and
I
split
a
Chocolate
Shake
-LRB-
$
6
-RRB-
to
start
off
.
It
's
what
you
'd
expect
from
the
setting
,
served
in
a
metal
tin
and
absolutely
delicious
.
I
as
good
as
chugged
mine
.
I
leaned
toward
lunch
this
time
around
and
got
the
Roast
Chicken
,
Bacon
&
Goat
Cheese
sandwich
-LRB-
$
9
-RRB-
.
This
dish
was
just
missing
a
wow-factor
-LRB-
in
addition
to
the
Oxford-comma
-RRB-
.
I
love
goat
cheese
,
and
expected
so
much
with
it
melted
between
two
pieces
of
sourdough
and
chicken
,
bacon
,
and
tomato
.
But
none
of
the
flavors
that
should
've
been
present
stood
out
.
The
salty
bacon
was
lost
in
the
grease
of
the
bread
.
There
may
not
have
been
any
tomato
.
The
chicken
was
bland
.
I
loved
the
shake
,
and
the
sandwich
was
by
no
means
bad
,
but
there
was
no
warm-feeling
deliciousness
I
expected
from
a
meal
in
such
a
diner
.
I
'd
return
,
but
get
something
else.This
place
is
AMAZING
!!
I
've
had
the
falafel
wrap
,
Monty
's
Blue
Plate
Burger
with
the
walnut
burger
and
tempeh
bacon
and
both
were
fabulous
!!!
I
had
to
narrow
my
options
down
to
my
top
6
choices
before
ordering
...
I
will
go
back
many
more
times
so
I
can
try
everything
I
want
to
order
!!
And
oh
my
gosh
the
pies
!!
Fat
Elvis
-LRB-
banana
cake
,
peanut
butter
frosting
filling
and
chocolate
frosting
-RRB-
and
Drumstick
-LRB-
Peanut
butter
silk
pie
with
a
fudge
layer
in
the
bottom
-RRB-
were
both
delicious
!
The
staff
is
also
very
nice
,
helpful
and
passionate.THEY
HAVE
PIES
AND
CAKES
.
But
how
can
you
have
any
pudding
if
you
do
n't
eat
your
meat
???
Ahem
,
the
``
meat
''
:
Bacon
and
cheddar
omelet
with
american
fried
potatoes
.
Scrambled
egg
whites
with
sweet
potato
hash
of
peppers
,
onions
,
and
zucchini
.
Spinach
,
onion
,
mushroom
,
and
feta
omelet
with
fresh
fruit
.
homemade
BISCUITS
:
o
Now
you
can
eat
your
pudding.The
``
ultimate
mac
&
cheese
''
really
is
the
ultimate
.
I
do
n't
know
how
to
make
mac
&
cheese
with
caramelized
onions
in
it
yet
,
but
I
will
learn
,
dammit
,
because
I
have
seen
the
LIGHT
.
The
accompanying
grilled
garlic
bread
was
alright
,
but
a
little
chewy
for
my
taste
-
I
'm
more
of
a
Texas-toast-crusty-garlic-bread
kinda
girl
.
Also
,
be
SURE
you
get
something
sweet
.
It
might
feel
weird
to
order
a
donut
or
a
shake
with
a
savory
lunch
or
dinner
meal
,
but
you
ca
n't
leave
without
it
.
Just
trust.Tried
this
place
based
upon
the
Yelp
reviews
.
My
girlfriend
&
I
had
hamburgers
.
I
also
had
a
salad
with
the
best
1000
island
dressing
I
've
ever
had
.
My
girlfriend
did
not
want
onions
and
her
burger
came
out
with
them
.
They
quickly
brought
her
a
new
one
.
We
finished
up
with
a
huge
Turtle
sundae
we
shared
.
Caution
:
this
sundae
is
not
for
only
one
person
.
Our
service
was
satisfactory
and
we
arrived
before
the
dinner
rush
-LRB-
430pm
-RRB-
,
so
seating
was
easy
.
At
6pm
,
the
place
had
a
significant
queue
,
but
it
was
a
Saturday
night
and
the
Barrymore
had
an
event
.
Overall
,
the
fare
,
the
cost
and
the
atmosphere
make
this
a
must
try.Breakfast
is
their
best
offering
here
.
Burgers
are
also
good
,
but
I
was
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
chicken
on
my
sandwich
.
We
had
to
wait
for
a
table
at
7:30
pm
.
Shows
their
business
is
good
but
I
was
surprised
at
the
late
dinner
rush
.
Other
people
waiting
for
a
table
stole
it
before
the
waitress
got
their
tip
.
Not
the
restaurant
's
fault
but
disappointed
in
the
guests.Monty
,
thank
you
for
saving
my
restaurant
foody
soul
last
night
.
After
a
disastrous
meal
at
another
restaurant
,
I
was
crabby
,
mad
,
moody
and
wanting
to
go
home
.
Luckily
we
drove
by
the
shining
light
of
the
Monty
's
sign
and
pulled
in
to
the
parking
lot
.
Grabbed
a
seat
at
the
counter
and
ordered
a
piece
of
pecan
pie
a
la
mode
for
myself
and
my
husband
.
Your
hostess
,
waitress
,
bus
staff
were
all
polite
,
welcoming
,
and
doing
their
jobs
.
They
refilled
our
coffee
,
checking
on
our
food
,
did
we
need
anything
else
?
THANK
YOU
!
The
pie
was
delicious
,
the
ice
cream
melted
slowly
into
the
pecan
crust
and
became
a
delicious
consoling
comfort
food
.
My
congratulation
on
being
a
place
that
I
have
visited
for
over
10
years
and
still
makes
the
mark
of
having
great
staff
,
great
food
and
ambiance
.
That
turquoise
counter
has
never
felt
so
good
to
lean
my
elbows
on
as
last
night.Ok
,
this
is
bad
news
-LRB-
for
me
and
my
waistline
-RRB-
...
Second
visit
to
Monte
's
was
1/27/14
for
``
dinner
,
''
although
I
was
there
for
some
breakfast
vittles
.

Obviously

Sweet

perfectly
seasoned

nice

were
ever-so-slightly

but
that
's

for

...

Good
coffee
,
with
speedy
refills
I
've
heard
the
shakes
and
burgers
are
good
;
I
'm
too
in
love
with
the
breakfast
fare
to
venture
to
that
side
of
the
menu
,
but
who
knows
...
I
'll
give
into
temptation
at
some
point
,
I
'm
sure.First
,
the
decor
and
the
building
itself
is
super
cool
.
It
really
gives
you
that
diner
feel
.
The
pies
and
desserts
right
when
you
walk
in
are
also
a
great
touch
-
they
look
absolutely
divine
!
We
came
on
a
Saturday
at
about
1:30
.
We
had
to
wait
for
about
15
minutes
,
not
too
bad
considering
how
small
the
space
is
.
Service
was
okay
.
Our
server
was
friendly
but
we
had
to
ask
about
5
times
for
silverware
until
we
actually
got
some
.
They
have
a
great
selection
of
breakfast
items
,
I
honestly
did
n't
pay
much
attention
to
anything
else
on
the
menu
.
They
are
really
good
about
marking
what
is
gluten-free
which
was
super
nice
.
I
ordered
the
corned
beef
hash
and
it
was
very
good
.
The
hash
had
great
flavor
and
the
eggs
were
cooked
perfectly
.
The
biscuit
looked
delicious
but
I
of
course
could
n't
eat
it
-LRB-
devastating
-RRB-
.
One
of
my
biggest
pet
peeves
though
is
when
there
is
food
on
the
plate
that
is
n't
meant
to
be
eaten
...
and
they
put
the
fruit
on
a
leaf
of
iceberg
lettuce
.
Not
a
deal
breaker
obviously
but
something
that
has
always
annoyed
me
.
My
boyfriend
ordered
the
country
breakfast
with
bacon
and
scrambled
eggs
.
He
said
it
was
really
good
,
especially
the
potatoes
.
This
place
is
officially
on
my
radar
as
another
great
breakfast
option!ah
Sunday
brunch
back
in
Madison
.
I
was
really
excited
to
try
this
place
but
I
think
I
got
slightly
disappointed
.
First
of
all
,
not
enough
parking
!
Probably
a
total
of
16
stalls
in
the
tiny
one
way
parking
lot
.
.
so
do
plan
on
car
pooling
here
.
I
circled
around
the
street
2
times
before
finding
a
parking
space
on
the
side
street
about
3
blocks
away
.
It
might
just
be
Sunday
though
.
.
who
knows
.
I
do
think
the
building
and
decor
is
kinda
cool
.
.
felt
like
a
good
old
diner
with
a
retro
kick
.
so
here
comes
the
food
part
.
.
I
ordered
corn
beef
hash
.
.
food
was
lukewarm
.
I
usually
like
my
hot
food
hot
.
.
not
like
somewhere
between
hot
and
cold
.
It
was
greasy
too
.
not
a
fan
.
I
did
like
the
side
fruits
that
came
with
it
.
.
def
gave
my
greasy
hash
a
little
break
.
I
think
I
would
come
try
their
dessert
next
time
.
The
pie
and
bakery
goods
look
more
yummy
.
.
until
next
time
.
Oh
btw
our
waiter
was
really
friendly
and
unobtrusive
so
if
you
are
the
type
of
person
into
good
table
service.Best
.
Place
.
EVEEER
.
been
going
there
for
years
and
never
had
a
single
bad
experience
.
everytime
I
go
there
i
have
higher
expectations
and
they
are
always
met
.
People
here
go
out
of
their
way
to
make
sure
that
you
like
your
food
,
waiters
know
evrything
that
goes
on
a
sandwich
down
to
the
ingredients
of
the
dressing
.
Best
of
all
the
prices
are
very
reasonable
and
the
atmosphere
is
so
Willy-like
.
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
the
veggie
sandwich
,
your
life
will
never
be
the
same
again
!
I
pretend
not
to
like
meatloaf
but
if
someone
I
'm
with
orders
it
,
I
make
sure
they
do
n't
have
any
leftovers
.
that
's
how
good
this
place
is
...
Love
this
place
!
My
favorite
?
Bloody
Mary
of
course
!
I
'd
say
it
's
the
best
Bloody
Mary
in
town
.
Food
is
always
delicious
.
Staff
is
always
friendly
and
helpful
.
In
three
years
of
going
to
Monty
's
Blue
Plate
Diner
we
never
had
a
negative
experience.Nice
atmosphere
and
fantastic
food
!
And
I
love
their
gluten
free
options
.
They
made
things
as
we
ordered
them
and
the
service
was
prompt
and
friendly
.
This
is
a
really
nice
``
diner
''
with
nice
decor
and
a
very
friendly
atmosphere
.
The
line
was
very
long
on
Sunday
morning
but
that
's
the
sign
of
anything
good
because
everyone
wanted
to
eat
there
.
Nom
nom
,
we
'll
be
back
!

-RRB-
This
is
just
an
average
place
.
Its
not
bad
.
Parking
is
free
,
small
lot
but
street
parking
around
the
area
is
possible
.
Went
there
for
brunch
.
Hippy
looking
teenage
waitress
was
patronizing
,
Could
n't
serve
me
a
side
of
bacon
with
my
Bloody
Mary
before
my
entree
for
whatever
reason
.
Biscuit
was
dry
,
really
nothing
special
.
Salmon
hash
was
average
and
not
very
many
salmon
pieces
,
mostly
potatoes
and
onion
.
It
was
tasty
none
the
less
.
Quantity
was
less
than
average
.
Bacon
was
just
like
what
they
serve
at
my
hospital
cafeteria
,
nothing
special
.
There
was
a
25
minute
wait
which
is
always
expected
at
a
good
brunch
place
.
Bloody
Mary
was
average
as
well
.
When
I
think
of
brunch
I
expect
a
quantity
and
quality
as
I
am
combining
both
meals
.
Here
Quantity
was
slightly
less
than
average
,
and
quality
was
average
.
Noise
level
-
Noisy
,
They
take
cards
including
AMEX
Have
no
idea
why
this
place
is
so
popular
.
Probably
people
have
n't
been
to
Original
pancake
house
,
much
better
service
and
far
better
food
and
cheaper
too
-LRB-
they
take
only
cash
-RRB-
We
tried
this
place
out
for
the
first
time
on
a
Saturday
in
March
.
From
the
reviews
I
had
read
on
here
,
I
knew
there
would
be
a
short
wait
.
I
think
we
waited
about
20-30
minutes
-LRB-
which
was
a
little
longer
than
i
was
expecting
-RRB-
.
Unfortunately
there
was
no
good
place
to
wait
either
.
We
constantly
felt
we
were
standing
in
someone
's
way
.
The
wait
did
give
us
a
chance
to
admire
their
beautiful
looking
pies
,
which
we
did
not
have
room
to
try
after
we
had
lunch
.
When
it
was
our
turn
,
someone
called
our
names
over
a
microphone
and
then
told
us
where
to
go
sit
.
We
found
our
seats
and
waited
for
the
waiter
.
There
were
3
menus
at
the
table
so
we
were
able
to
start
looking
through
what
they
had
to
offer
.
The
waiter
came
and
took
our
drink
order
but
never
brought
us
a
fourth
menu
.
He
also
never
introduced
himself
.
After
looking
over
the
entire
menu
the
only
thing
that
really
jumped
out
at
me
was
their
milk
shakes
and
ice
creams
.
Nothing
else
really
jumped
out
at
me
and
made
me
think
``
Oh
wow
that
is
really
different
and
sounds
really
good
?
''
.
I
think
it
is
a
good
basic
breakfast
place
to
those
who
are
vegetarians
or
gluten
free
!
But
for
the
rest
of
us
it
is
n't
anything
spectacular
.
I
had
an
omelette
which
was
fine
,
though
the
biscuit
that
came
with
it
was
tasty
.
My
friend
had
asked
the
waiter
for
a
refill
on
his
water
which
never
came
and
my
coffee
never
got
refilled
until
we
had
finished
eating
after
all
the
dishes
and
utensils
were
taken
away
so
i
could
n't
stir
my
cream
or
sugar
.
To
sum
things
up
:
This
place
was
just
an
average
diner
that
did
n't
have
a
wow
factor
to
anything
.
Would
be
a
good
place
for
those
seeking
vegetarian/gluten
free
options
and
are
just
wanting
``
normal/ordinary
''
breakfast/lunch
options
.
I
would
not
venture
back
for
a
second
time.My
old
supervisor
took
me
and
my
ex-fiance
'
here
shortly
after
I
started
working
for
her
.
It
was
really
good
diner
food
,
and
was
very
easy
on
the
pocket
book
.
I
have
n't
been
back
since
,
but
I
would
n't
hesitate
to
stop
by
if
I
was
in
the
area
and
craved
diner
fare
:
-RRB-
Everything
about
this
place
was
mediocre
.
The
food
was
mediocre
,
the
ambiance
was
mediocre
and
the
service
was
mediocre.Fantastic
pie
!
And
food
.
And
the
servers
were
awesome
.
Now
there
's
needs
to
be
one
in
Indiana
.
And
Ohio
.
In
general
they
should
just
be
everywhere.Breakfast
heaven
.
Grab
the
French
Toast
and
a
side
of
hash
browns.Great
brunch
,
good
service
.
Dinner
is
fancier
diner
food
that
might
be
a
little
overpriced
for
what
it
is.Food
is
consistently
good
.
We
often
go
for
weekend
brunch
.
I
'm
from
NJ
,
which
has
a
lot
of
24
hour
diners
.
This
is
one
of
the
only
places
in
Madison
that
offers
breakfast
all
day
,
so
it
's
great
in
my
book
.
Do
n't
come
if
you
mind
long
lines
or
kids
;
do
come
if
you
like
yeasted
doughnuts!Hate
the
wait
,
but
love
the
place
all
the
same
.
Great
,
great
food
and
convenient
to
Olbrich
Gardens.This
place
has
awesome
decor
.
Great
parking
.
Awesome
staff
.
Mediocre
food.I
like
Monty
's
!
Great
atmosphere
,
yummy
desserts
,
and
good
burgers.One
of
my
favorite
places
in
Madison
.
You
can
never
go
wrong
with
an
artichoke
sand
which
and
some
crisscuts
-LRB-
they
are
worth
the
extra
money
-RRB-
.
I
like
it
here
,
but
I
do
n't
love
it
.
Nothing
really
stands
out
to
me
,
although
my
friend
swears
by
the
meatloaf
-LRB-
I
refuse
to
order
meatloaf
in
a
restaurant
-RRB-
.
I
will
continue
to
got
back
,
but
I
wo
n't
go
out
of
my
way.Monty
's
Blue
Plate
is
a
local
gem
.
Expect
unique
menu
items
that
focus
on
tasty
,
healthy
,
and
fresh
.
They
have
things
like
burgers
that
you
would
expect
at
any
diner
but
they
do
their
own
unique
spin
on
standards
.
My
latest
meal
was
a
burger
with
carmelized
onions
,
herbed
goat
cheese
,
and
spinach
.
.
Sooo
good
.
They
are
also
sort
of
famous
for
their
bean
salad
-
even
my
two
year
old
goes
for
that
one
.
After
your
meal
you
have
an
array
of
some
of
the
best
cakes
and
pies
.
Their
carrot
cake
is
the
best
I
have
ever
had
and
sometimes
we
will
go
there
just
for
that!Great
food
and
great
atmosphere
!
Always
fun!Eh
it
was
okay
.
Maybe
I
should
have
ordered
breakfast
as
that
looks
like
that
's
what
they
are
known
for
.
But
I
was
there
at
lunch
time
and
craved
a
burger
so
that
's
what
I
ordered
.
It
was
ok
nothing
special
to
brag
about
.
I
would
probably
go
there
again
but
for
sure
going
to
try
the
breakfast.Shut
your
mouth
!
Meatloaf
of
the
Gods
!
There
are
three
types
of
meat
rolled
into
this
meatloaf
.
It
comes
with
a
red
wine
gravy
,
mashed
potatoes
and
veggies
.
All
of
this
for
$
10
.
Yup
,
a
complete
,
well-rounded
,
mouth
watering
meal
for
just
$
10
.
The
broccoli
was
blanched
rather
than
steam
.
So
it
was
not
mushy
.
The
service
is
incredible
.
The
people
are
friendly
and
the
food
comes
up
fast
.
I
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
.
On
a
date
?
With
family
?
Have
a
small
child
?
Check
this
place
out
.
They
get
desserts
from
a
local
bakery
.
The
carrot
cake
is
ridiculous
.
Are
you
full
from
your
meal
?
Take
cake
or
pie
to
go
.
Seriously
,
you
will
not
regret
a
snack
for
later.Had
a
great
meal
with
some
old
friends
who
adore
this
place
,
and
I
can
see
why
.
Imagine
a
retro
diner
that
serves
breakfast
all
day
...
and
lots
of
sandwiches
,
burgers
and
other
entreees
...
and
several
vegetarian
and
vegan
options
...
and
has
a
killer
bakery
...
and
allows
kids
to
play
with
sidewalk
chalk
outside
.
What
's
not
to
love
?
I
really
wanted
to
try
the
TNT
BLT
or
the
GBLT
-LRB-
clever
-RRB-
,
but
they
ran
out
of
tempeh
,
so
I
chose
the
almond
milk
french
toast
,
which
was
divine
,
and
a
biscuit
.
I
really
wanted
a
slice
of
pie
,
but
was
worried
about
drifting
into
a
food
coma
on
the
drive
back
to
Chicago
.
Next
time
...
I
love
this
place
and
go
all
the
time
.
I
am
vegetarian
and
it
is
a
great
spot
to
eat
with
my
meat
eating
friends
.
It
has
a
good
mix
of
veggie
friendly
food
and
meaty
dishes.Had
the
vegan
banana
walnut
pancakes
.
Delicious
!
Service
was
fast
and
polite
.
My
partner
had
the
morning
bun
.
VERY
GOOD
.
They
were
out
of
the
homemade
donuts
by
11:00
AM
:-LRB-
-
get
there
early
to
try
those
!
I
knock
off
one
star
because
they
were
really
good
but
not
the
best.Absolutely
amazing
...
100
%
real
food
,
and
a
menu
that
can
fit
almost
any
dietary
need
!
My
partner
had
the
meatloaf
-LRB-
with
luscious
broccoli
--
try
saying
that
in
the
same
sentence
-RRB-
,
superb
homemade
gravy
,
and
real
mashed
potatoes
with
the
skins
on
them
...
I
had
the
Cobb
salad
,
and
if
you
are
a
foodie
,
you
know
that
Cobb
salad
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
put
on
a
menu
--
it
is
difficult
to
execute
properly
,
and
this
was
perfect
.
We
will
be
back
,
again
,
and
again
,
and
again
...
wish
we
had
found
this
years
ago!Loved
going
to
this
place
.
As
a
night
shift
worker
,
this
was
the
best
place
for
a
good
breakfast
and
good
drink
.
Recommend
highly
!

Great
home
cooking
!
fresh
well
made
food
that
gives
mom
's
at
home
cooking
a
run
for
it
's
money
!
``
If
you
are
hungry
for
a
great
filling
meal
,
just
head
to
Monty
's
''
is
my
new
Motto
.
Love
the
huge
parking
lot
!
Easy
in
and
out
every
time
-LRB-
if
you
can
find
a
spot
due
to
me
being
not
the
only
other
person
loving
this
joint
-RRB-
Wish
they
had
later
hours
.
They
are
only
open
to
10pm
,
which
I
'm
kind
of
confused
with
considering
they
are
directly
across
from
the
Barrymore
theater
.
But
...
I
still
have
a
solid
5
stars
for
this
new
love
of
my
life.So
when
that
BBQ
Joint
was
randomly
closed
on
a
Friday
night
-
we
would
up
here
.
I
had
not
been
here
in
a
few
years
so
forgot
how
vegetarian
friendly
this
place
is
.
If
you
are
a
vegetarian
this
place
is
great
,
but
if
you
are
meat
eat
-
this
place
is
also
good
.
They
do
comfort
food
in
good
portions
at
reasonable
prices
.
The
food
is
not
spectacular
,
its
not
taking
you
back
to
Grandma
's
kitchen
.
But
if
you
go
here
often
-
I
can
see
it
turning
to
the
neighborhood
joint
,
when
you
feel
like
home
.
You
can
bring
your
friends
or
family
,
and
have
a
decent
meal
.
But
given
I
live
across
the
city-that
's
not
going
to
be
me
.
So
i
judge
it
just
purely
based
on
the
food
,
and
on
this
particular
day
-
it
was
as
Yelp
puts
its
``
A-Ok
.
''
I
got
the
Bistro
Burger
with
fries
.
It
was
cooked
how
I
like
it
.
My
husband
got
the
Roast
Turkey
Platter
-
it
was
really
tender
but
a
little
bland
for
my
taste
.
As
Elizabeth
said
-
the
brocolli
was
good
.
The
blanching
makes
a
huge
difference.The
mashed
potatoes
decent
.
The
service
acceptable
.
I
would
go
back
but
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice.It
is
absolutely
what
you
want
it
to
be
.
It
embodies
the
era
of
diners
so
well
.
The
food
was
delicious
.
I
have
had
the
Grilled
Cheese
and
the
Mac
and
Cheese
-LRB-
I
added
bacon
,
yum
!
-RRB-
both
were
wonderful
.
The
milkshakes
and
malts
are
amazing
as
well
.
It
can
definitely
get
loud
and
sometimes
there
's
a
wait
,
but
either
way
it
is
definitely
worth
it
for
this
Madison
gem.I
always
have
awesome
food
here
.
I
am
ready
to
start
tryign
out
awesome
coctailsgreat
diner
with
good
veggie
and
vegan
options
.
overall
very
nice
staff
,
friendly
,
prompt
great
desserts!Driving
back
from
Wisconsin
Dells
to
Illinois
hungover
and
following
a
strict
vegetarian
diet
,
can
be
a
little
tricky
.
I
had
n't
been
to
Madison
in
a
few
years
,
so
we
decided
to
try
a
place
in
Madison
-LRB-
I
also
figured
that
they
would
be
more
likely
to
have
restaurants
that
cater
to
my
needs
-RRB-
.
My
boyfriend
did
some
yelping
,
and
shortly
we
were
on
our
way
to
Monty
's
.
There
is
a
private
lot
which
is
always
nice
when
you
're
in
a
busy
city
.
We
did
not
sit
outside
because
it
was
a
little
chilly
but
the
patio
looked
pleasant
and
relaxing
with
beautiful
flowers
.
When
you
go
inside
the
ambience
is
a
funky
little
50
's
diner
with
amazing
looking
pies
.
Even
though
the
restaurant
was
crowded
,
we
were
able
to
get
a
table
fairly
quickly
.
As
I
opened
up
the
menu
,
I
almost
died
but
before
that
I
even
thought
of
moving
to
Madison
right
away
!
There
are
so
many
vegetarian
,
vegan
,
gluten
free
options
that
it
is
the
majority
of
the
menu
,
which
is
so
rare
to
find
at
a
breakfast
diner
.
We
both
ordered
the
sweet
potato
hash
and
it
was
to
die
for
!
Just
what
we
needed
that
day
!
I
wish
there
was
another
one
in
Illinois
.
My
only
suggestion
is
to
serve
the
fruit
on
a
separate
plate
instead
of
piling
it
all
on
one
big
plate
,
that
makes
the
food
messy
and
crowded.I
have
a
love/not
love
relationship
with
Monty
's
.
I
used
to
love
them
for
b-fast
when
I
ate
omlets
.
Now
that
I
'm
vegan
,
it
's
kinda
hard
to
love
them
.
Many
of
the
items
ca
n't
be
changed
,
so
if
you
're
not
a
fan
of
onions
or
even
allergic
to
them
,
they
ca
n't
come
out
of
items
because
they
are
pre-made
in
batches
.
They
are
my
last
ditch
place
to
go
to
if
Lazy
Jane
's
,
The
Green
Owl
or
any
other
place
is
busy
or
closed.Had
to
visit
this
place
while
in
town
based
on
a
recommendation
from
a
good
friend
.
I
had
the
sesame
chicken
salad
and
a
brandy
alexander
to
drink
--
both
tasted
great
...
but
wish
I
would
have
ordered
the
vegetarian
meatloaf
with
cashew-ginger
gravy
,
as
I
tasted
my
friend
's
and
it
was
SPECTACULAR
!
Unlike
anything
I
ever
had
--
I
've
been
craving
it
since
we
were
there
.
Cute/comfortable/casual
atmosphere
,
polite
and
pleasant
server
,
good/unique
variety
and
great
vegetarian
options
--
highly
recommend
this
place
if
you
're
looking
for
comfort-type
food
and/or
a
place
that
feels
low-key
.
Came
in
for
brunch
today
and
had
a
very
nice
experience
.
I
really
like
their
décor
,
classic
diner
style
.
I
got
the
Meatloaf
and
oh
my
goodness
it
was
so
AMAZING
!
The
homemade
gravy
was
to
die
for
!
My
friend
got
the
Egg
Mornay
I
did
n't
try
it
but
it
looked
delicious
.
Our
server
Eric
was
also
amazing
!
I
will
definitely
be
returning
soon
,
for
a
first
time
experience
I
give
five
stars
!
As
a
side
note
as
we
were
walking
out
every
single
employee
that
we
passes
said
,
``
Thank
you
,
have
a
great
day
.
``
I
love
this
place
!
They
have
amazing
cheesecakes
,
breakfast
options
and
yummy
sammies
.
My
favorite
thing
to
eat
is
the
grilled
chicken
and
goat
cheese
sandwich
!
The
flavors
are
so
fresh
and
work
well
.
I
also
love
to
sneak
raspberry
cheesecake
when
I
am
done
;
-RRB-
It
's
always
fun
to
take
people
to
Monty
's
.
The
parking
lot
is
a
good
indicator
of
how
busy
the
place
will
be
.
Be
aware
,
though
,
that
the
booths
have
very
little
tummy
room
,
especially
for
those
of
us
who
are
n't
so
svelte
.
If
you
fall
into
that
category
,
try
to
get
a
table
on
the
left
side
of
the
restaurant
.
Your
ego
will
thank
me
later
.

-RRB-
I
could
have
sworn
I
wrote
a
review
?
anyhoo
...
went
here
on
the
suggestion
of
a
few
vegheads
.
they
used
to
have
vegan
milkshakes
&
ice
cream
...
sadly
,
no
more
:-LRB-
dinner
was
tasty
,
though
--
heathen
vegan
shoplifter
sandwich
&
cherry
pie
!!!
nothing
Earth-shattering
,
but
solid
.
and
probably
one
of
your
vegan
best
options
in
Madison.This
place
has
really
great
brunch
.
They
also
serve
alcohol
-LRB-
bottled
beer
and
spirits
only
-RRB-
.
I
had
their
Bloody
Mary
and
an
omlet
last
time
I
was
there
and
it
just
felt
right
.
Try
having
that
experience
at
a
Perkins
or
Dennys
.
Not
happening
.
-LRB-
P.S.
the
omlets
are
amazing
,
and
if
you
ask
for
jalapenos
on
the
side
,
they
are
fresh
cut
which
rocks
socks
in
my
opinion
-RRB-
Also
,
the
place
is
very
natural
,
with
all
of
its
ingredients
seemingly
sourced
locally
or
something
-
the
ingredients
are
fresh
is
what
I
mean
to
say
.
Not
even
comparable
to
a
Denny
's
,
so
do
n't
let
me
above
reference
scare
you.As
everyone
in
Madison
knows
,
there
are
no
doughnut
chain
stores
around
.
No
Krispy
Kreme
.
No
Dunkin
Donuts
.
Although
I
know
that
the
best
doughnuts
in
town
are
from
the
Greenbush
Bakery
,
sometimes
it
's
just
easier
to
go
with
the
place
down
the
street
.
That
basically
sums
up
the
People
's
Bakery
.
When
you
're
too
lazy
to
go
anywhere
else
,
they
are
pretty
good.Kind
of
tucked
away
and
hard
to
notice
,
especially
being
next
to
the
really
glammed
out
Ella
's
Deli
.
But
worth
a
visit
if
you
're
looking
for
a
good
gyro
or
kebab
.
:]
The
donuts
are
alright
too
.
They
have
a
wide
variety
!
Myself
,
I
really
rather
like
their
cookies
.
They
also
offer
homemade
baklava
.
Really
though
I
can
reccomend
their
sandwiches
with
a
side
of
the
seasoned
fries
.
Quite
yummy
!
Vegetarian
options
also
available
such
as
potato
kahbi
or
falafel
sandwiches
.
And
they
had
a
lot
of
beverages
to
choose
from
too
.
Although
the
location
is
not
ideal
,
it
's
worth
a
stop
if
you
're
in
that
part
of
town
.
:
-RSB-
I
've
been
lamenting
the
lack
of
Mediterranean
establishments
on
the
Eastside
for
a
while
.
We
have
arguably
the
best
Thai
,
Indian
,
Nepali
,
Jamaican
,
Japanese
,
Chinese
and
American
restaurants
in
town
.
But
Downtown
and
the
Westside
both
hold
the
Mediterranean
trump
card
.
Then
I
discovered
People
's
Bakery
.
How
can
you
go
wrong
?
Fresh
pastry
AND
gyros
?
Wait
.
Did
I
say
gyros
?
Yes
,
I
did
.
No
longer
do
you
have
to
venture
downtown
to
get
said
sandwich
.
And
the
one
I
had
was
n't
a
ticking
grease
bomb
!
Do
yourself
a
favor
when
you
go
and
try
the
red
lentil
soup
.
The
flavor
is
excellent
and
there
's
plenty
of
cumin
to
spare
.
Delicious
!
My
gyro
and
bowl
of
soup
plus
coffee
was
under
$
10
,
so
it
's
a
great
choice
when
you
're
low
on
cash
and
need
a
filling
lunch
.
-LRB-
Oh
,
and
it
's
right
next
to
El
Pescador
,
across
from
the
Madison
East
Shopping
Center
.
Pretty
easy
to
miss
when
driving
.
-RRB-
Yum
.
Very
good
chocolate
glazed
donut
.
Decent
coffee
,
though
nothing
fancy
and
I
like
it
much
stronger
.
Will
try
their
falafel
soon.The
doughnuts
are
good
-LRB-
and
pretty
cheap
!
-RRB-
,
but
I
really
love
this
place
for
a
quick
,
cheap
lunch
.
They
make
their
falafel
and
gyros
fresh
,
so
be
prepared
to
wait
a
few
minutes
for
them
to
put
'em
together
.
There
's
a
small
dining
area
,
or
you
can
take
your
food
to
go
.
The
owners
are
friendly
and
efficient
.
The
only
thing
I
really
wish
this
place
would
do
is
make
fresh
bread
and
rolls
,
but
it
's
strictly
doughnuts
and
sweet
pastries
here.Best
Gyros
,
hands
down
.
And
reasonably
priced
too
.
Good
chicken
sandwiches
.
And
their
mediteranian
entrees
are
delicious
as
well
.
As
for
the
donuts
,
they
are
above
average
but
not
amazing
.
The
owners
are
so
kind
.
I
like
going
here.good
food
and
very
cheap.Since
moving
to
the
east
side
I
have
started
to
go
here
almost
every
Saturday
morning
to
pick
up
a
couple
of
donuts
and
a
coffee
.
I
had
absolutely
no
idea
that
it
existed
until
a
cabbie
friend
of
mine
told
me
it
was
one
of
his
favorite
places
to
stop
between
fares
.
-LRB-
Can
I
just
say
that
cabbies
are
amazing
?
They
know
where
everything
is
,
and
they
know
about
all
the
cool
hidden
spots
that
most
of
us
pass
up
every
day
.
If
you
know
a
cabbie
,
pick
their
brain
sometime
.
You
will
probably
discover
at
least
one
awesome
place
because
of
them
.
-RRB-
So
,
back
to
People
's
.
The
donuts
are
really
top
notch
.
Chewy
,
moist
,
iced
just
enough
,
and
they
have
a
ton
of
options
.
I
really
think
that
their
plain
glazed
and
their
boston
cream
donuts
are
the
best
.
Their
glazed
donuts
have
this
bit
of
crispiness
to
them
that
is
amazing
.
The
fritters
are
n't
as
good
as
Greenbush
,
but
still
tasty
.
There
are
also
some
specialty
desserts
that
I
am
unsure
of
,
but
will
have
to
try
some
day
.
As
far
as
the
food
goes
-
the
gyros
are
among
the
best
I
have
had
in
town
-LRB-
right
up
there
with
Gyro
House
-RRB-
but
that
is
all
I
have
tried
there
so
far
.
So
,
to
sum
it
all
up
:
good
gyros
,
great
donuts
,
fair
prices
,
and
great
-LRB-
but
sort
of
slow
-RRB-
service
.
This
place
is
definitely
worth
checking
out.Great
Donut
&
drink
selection
,
and
the
food
is
cooked
right
in
front
of
you
.
The
place
is
a
little
out
of
the
way
,
the
only
thing
that
youll
see
is
a
neon
`
Gyros
'
sign
in
the
window
,
but
its
worth
stopping
by
.
The
people
are
very
friendly
,
and
the
value
is
the
best
for
the
immediate
area
-LRB-
and
this
is
from
a
UW
student
who
frequents
the
nearby
TacoBell
trying
to
slim
budget
...
-RRB-
.
The
only
thing
I
can
think
of
against
the
place
are
the
hours
-
I
really
wish
they
stayed
open
longer
!
I
cant
count
how
many
times
ive
been
returning
from
groceries
or
whaterver
and
passed
by
the
place
,
closed
,
and
realized
my
dinner
options
were
slim
to
none
.
One
can
hope
for
the
futre
though
,
and
if
youre
ever
around
stop
in
,
the
donuts
-LRB-
hard
to
come
by
since
I
moved
to
Madison
-
just
imagining
maybe
-RRB-
alone
are
worth
a
trip.I
usually
go
here
because
they
have
some
Halal
dishes
but
it
's
definitely
not
my
``
go
-
to
''
place
for
Halal
.
I
find
that
I
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
in
order
to
really
enjoy
it
.
However
,
my
husband
swears
by
their
chicken
and
I
do
really
enjoy
their
kefta
with
rice.Updated
review
,
I
have
to
give
them
more
stars
.
For
one
they
have
pretty
tasty
food
once
I
tried
more
dishes
.
The
cucumber
sauce
on
the
side
also
really
good
.
It
has
also
become
my
stop
for
mousaka
!
MmmmThe
food
and
service
attitude
is
pretty
good
for
the
price
you
pay
.
They
also
got
all
kinds
of
beverages
to
go
with
your
meal
.
They
cook
it
fresh
after
you
place
an
order
.
The
owners
are
very
nice
.
We
had
the
vegetarian
meza
.
Everything
tastes
good
,
though
I
've
definitely
had
better
middle
eastern
food
before
.
But
for
the
price
you
pay
,
the
food
is
well
worth
it
.
All
the
basics
are
done
right
,
e.g.
dolma
,
hummus
,
kabob/shawarma
,
cucumber
yogurt
,
kofta
,
kebbi
,
etc.
.
But
I
will
mention
stuff
they
could
improve
a
bit
more
:
The
red
pepper
paste
was
a
bit
bitter
,
but
taste
fresh
Tabouli
was
a
bit
saucy
-LRB-
ask
them
to
use
less
dressing
-RRB-
.
I
have
n't
had
any
of
the
falafel
or
gyros
here
...
...
yet
.
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
fatten
myself
up
that
much
more
by
eating
some
of
their
delicious
doughnuts
.
They
are
really
cheap
AND
really
good
.
The
owners
are
a
friendly
,
older
couple
who
look
like
they
are
workin
'
hard
.
I
asked
if
they
would
be
my
new
parents
,
and
they
just
laughed
,
but
I
was
serious
.
Will
you
be
my
new
mom
and
dad
?
Or
how
about
my
new
granny
and
papa
?
I
wo
n't
ask
for
money
...
...
...
just
doughnuts
!
I
'm
toilet
trained
...
...
*
knocking
on
glass
window

Please
???
We
will
drive
from
Dudgeon
Monroe
to
the
East
side
for
good
falafel
and
gyros
.
The
quality
and
service
at
People
's
Bakery
are
a
great
reminder
why
the
-LRB-
much
closer
-RRB-
Biryani
does
n't
deserve
our
business
.
Skip
the
babaganoush
,
but
make
sure
to
grab
a
sweet
treat
for
dessert
instead!The
donuts
are
amazing
and
super-fattening
of
course
,
but
then
I
guess
you
should
n't
be
eating
donuts
if
you
are
concerned
with
your
weight
.
I
agree
it
is
by
far
the
best
gyros
in
town
,
I
am
originally
from
Chicago
and
am
used
to
the
quality
of
gyros
found
all
over
Chicagoland
,
this
is
cut
the
same
,
same
thickness
,
same
style
,
the
flavor
is
similar
,
but
has
it
's
own
thing
going
on
.
Either
way
,
that
Parthenon
in
Madison
is
crap
,
people
rave
about
it
,
what
a
joke
,
they
have
no
clue
what
good
gyros
is
,
take
a
road
trip
and
go
eat
at
Hubs
in
Chicago
,
then
you
will
know
finally
what
great
gyros
is
.
In
the
meantime
,
if
you
are
stuck
in
Madison
,
this
is
by
far
the
best
you
will
find
,
do
n't
waste
your
money
and
calories
elsewhere
.
Falafel
is
good
,
has
it
's
own
unique
recipe
,
works
for
me
.
Tan
Tan
Chicken
is
very
good
too
,
highly
spiced
,
which
I
like
,
although
not
spicy
as
far
as
heat
is
concerned
.
Comes
with
an
awesome
garlic
dip
,
which
I
've
only
found
in
Los
Angeles
at
Zankou
Chicken
,
which
by
the
way
is
the
most
incredible
middle-eastern
chicken
ever
.
They
even
made
a
``
Curb
Your
Enthusiasm
''
episode
about
it
in
2011
.
If
you
get
out
to
LA
ever
,
you
must
go
to
Zankou
and
get
the
Chicken
Tarna
with
the
garlic
dip
,
the
hummus
is
also
the
best
ever
.
Almost
enough
to
make
me
want
to
move
back
to
LA.
.
In
fact
...
Anyway
,
People
's
Bakery
is
truly
a
gem
in
Madison
,
amongst
all
the
questionable
eateries
,
which
some
say
are
great
,
others
say
bad
,
this
one
is
clearly
a
huge
winner
.
And
it
is
a
real
Mom
&
Pop
,
literally
they
made
all
the
food
for
me
,
super
friendly
,
down
to
Earth
,
real
people
who
deserve
to
have
your
business
.
Go
there
now
!
P.S.
I
also
liked
a
bunch
of
other
stuff
there
,
the
hummus
,
side
dishes
,
veggie
mezza
,
etc.
.
Probably
ca
n't
go
wrong
with
anything
there.Great
place
to
go
for
gyros
,
falafel
,
and
lots
of
other
delicious
Mediterranean
/
Lebanese
food
that
's
worth
trying
.
Also
,
the
food
is
really
cheap
-
you
can
get
a
whole
huge
bag
of
great
food
for
under
20
bucks
.
An
older
Lebanese
couple
run
this
place
-
they
are
very
nice
and
do
a
good
job
.
As
far
as
the
bakery
items
,
go
with
twisty
donut
things
w
/
the
red
strip
down
the
middle
or
the
baklava.wasn
'
t
sure
what
to
expect
,
but
the
food
was
EXCELLENT
.
personal
service
from
the
husband
&
wife
owners
make
you
feel
right
at
home
.
the
tabouleh
and
hommos
definitely
rival
anyplace
i
've
ever
tried
.
they
actually
make
the
tabouleh
to
order
!!!
incredibly
fresh
and
delicious
.
delicious
baklava
!
and
,
although
i
did
n't
try
any
,
the
donuts
also
looked
amazing
.
might
have
to
stop
back
and
pick
up
a
dozen
,
for
the
road.Now
this
is
what
I
'm
talking
about
!!
Total
hole
in
the
wall
on
East
Wash
in
a
strip
mall
behind
some
Mexican
buffet
,
with
the
name
People
's
Bakery
,
you
'd
never
guess
this
place
would
have
the
best
Middle
Eastern
food
in
Madison
.
Start
with
the
wife
of
the
wife
and
husband
team
,
who
greets
you
warmly
as
you
come
in
.
The
menu
is
on
the
wall
,
but
there
are
hard
copies
for
those
who
need
an
explanation
of
the
nicely
blended
mix
of
Lebanese
,
Armenian
and
Syrian
dishes
.
No
matter
your
experience
with
food
of
the
Middle
East
or
Mediterranean
,
you
'll
find
dishes
you
recognize
,
perhaps
by
different
names
.
This
was
my
first
visit
,
I
'm
sitting
here
eating
my
takeout
order
as
I
type
this
because
it
's
that
good
.
I
ordered
the
lentil
soup
,
and
several
appetizer
portions
including
hummus
,
moohamara
,
sarma
,
and
falafel
.
Quick
review
:
-
lentil
soup
.
Awesome
,
just
awesome
.
Beautiful
saffron
color
from
the
cooked
down
red
lentils
,
just
the
right
mix
of
cumin
and
lemon
,
and
a
back
end
of
heat
,
I
'm
guessing
from
Aleppo
pepper
.
This
is
some
thick
soup
,
and
filling
,
and
for
2.50
,
you
get
a
pint
-
Moohamara
.
I
was
n't
going
to
get
this
.
I
like
roasted
red
bell
pepper
,
and
I
've
had
dips
and
purees
made
of
them
,
but
I
've
never
sought
it
out
.
Mary
,
one
of
the
owners
,
told
me
it
was
her
favorite
,
best
on
the
menu
.
And
holy
COW
was
she
right
.
A
smack
of
roasted
red
pepper
is
quickly
deepened
by
a
sweet
hit
of
pomegranate
and
walnuts
,
ubelievably
complex
and
wonderful
.
-
Falafel
.
Huge
portion
,
perfectly
deep-fried
,
with
a
really
nice
,
light
texture
.
Love
the
falafel
,
but
I
prefer
tahini
sauce
,
and
these
come
with
a
yogurt
mint
sauce
.
Do
n't
get
me
wrong
,
this
is
clearly
their
regional
interpretation
,
Im
all
about
the
authentic
experience
,
and
this
was
good
sauce
.
But
,
I
confess
that
for
my
leftovers
I
'm
making
some
tahini
sauce
.
-
Hummus
.
You
know
,
hummus
is
always
a
crap
shoot
for
me
.
I
make
my
own
,
from
dried
chick
peas
,
and
I
've
been
working
on
this
recipe
for
25
years
-LRB-
along
with
my
Bloody
Mary
recipe
and
about
a
hundred
others
-RRB-
.
This
is
another
of
those
regional
interpretation
issues
,
this
was
my
least
favorite
today
.
I
'll
try
it
again
,
because
my
own
hummus
has
on
and
off
days
.
This
was
just
more
on
the
bland
side
than
I
expected
,
No
one
distinct
flavor
dominated
so
I
felt
like
it
was
left
with
an
almost
indescribable
flavor
.
Not
bad
,
totally
edible
,
just
oddly
unflavored
.
I
added
some
lemon
and
salt
,
which
helped
some
.
Sarma
-
if
you
're
expecting
dolmathes
this
will
be
familiar
in
flavor
,
but
it
texture
.
These
are
served
cold
with
a
yogurt
dipping
sauce
.
I
'm
okay
with
the
temperature
,
but
I
just
like
a
little
lemon
on
mine
.
These
are
veg
,
the
rice
filling
is
cooked
down
to
a
coarse
`
risotto-y
'
consistency
.
I
dig
them
,
but
those
who
prefer
the
snap
of
dolmathes
will
find
these
softer
,
but
just
as
flavorful
All
in
all
,
outstanding
.
Next
time
,
shish
tahouk
and
baba
ganouj.After
moving
from
Chicago
to
Madison
,
I
thought
that
I
would
be
safely
tucking
my
Lebanese
palate
into
the
furthest
recesses
of
my
tongue
,
saving
it
only
for
the
occasional
trips
back
to
Kedzie
Avenue
.
That
was
,
until
my
wife
and
I
discovered
People
's
bakery
.
Upon
walking
in
,
I
was
thrown
back
into
the
likes
of
such
wonderful
restaurants
as
Salam
and
Semiramis
...
but
with
Donuts
!
We
were
genuinely
welcomed
in
and
I
knew
People
's
Bakery
was
gon
na
be
one
of
my
new
spots
,
having
not
even
tried
a
single
thing
in
the
store
.
We
ordered
a
lunch
``
to-go
.
''
I
got
a
Shish
Taouk
-LRB-
commonly
known
as
a
Chicken
Shawarma
-RRB-
and
my
wife
got
a
falafel
sandwich
and
we
split
a
side
of
Hummus
.
Well
,
my
Shish
Tauok
was
plump
with
heavily
marinated
,
tender
chicken
slices
,
tomatoes
,
tahina
,
and
lettuce
.
In
short
,
it
was
outstanding
.
Aggressive
herbal
flavors
perfectly
matched
with
a
spike
of
lemony
acidity
.
My
wife
LOVED
her
falafel
sandwich
...
which
is
really
saying
something
,
as
she
's
somewhat
of
connoisseur
.
The
hummus
was
really
good
,
and
the
spike
of
sumac
was
a
nice
touch
,
although
it
was
tad
bit
to
lemony
for
me
.
Nonetheless
,
this
is
an
AWESOME
Madtown
ethnic
eats
spot
...
and
oh
yeah
...
how
can
completely
dismiss
the
incredible
homemade
donut
selection
?
They
looked
stunningly
good
,
but
we
both
left
that
for
another
day
.
Lebanese
food
and
donuts
...
a
winning
combination
,
in
my
book.Who
says
donuts
and
Lebanese
food
do
n't
go
together
?!
People
's
Bakery
has
made
me
a
believer
of
this
magical
combination
!
This
place
is
great
for
some
affordable
,
delicious
Lebanese
food
,
and
some
of
the
best
donuts
in
town
.
The
outside
-LRB-
and
inside
-RRB-
is
unassuming
,
but
the
food
is
authentic
-LRB-
as
far
as
I
know
-RRB-
and
yummy
.
Pros
-
VERY
affordable
-
friendly
and
helpful
staff
-
Did
I
mention
it
is
scrumptious
?
Cons
-
service
is
a
little
slow
-
inconsistent
drink
options
I
highly
recommend
trying
their
falafel
with
a
fritter
for
dessert.great
donuts
.
great
gyros
.
and
the
most
adorable
owners
ever
.
just
make
sure
you
are
n't
in
any
rush
,
if
you
think
about
ordering
food
here
.
still
worth
visiting.This
place
is
so
accidental
hipster
,
and
defies
categorization
.
Is
it
a
diner
?
A
bakery
?
An
auntie
's
living
room
?
Let
's
just
say
if
a
donut
shop
and
a
small
restaurant
played
Tetris
,
this
would
be
the
result
.
The
eating
area
is
quiet
-
no
music
,
just
the
drink
cooler
humming
-
and
the
experience
eclectic
-
mismatched
formica
tables
,
plastic
cups
for
water
,
and
tea
cups
with
feet
for
the
Turkish
coffee
.
The
Turkish
coffee
was
weaker
than
expected
,
but
wonderfully
aromatized
with
cardamom
.
There
was
so
much
food
my
eyes
pin-balled
for
a
minute
.
The
red
lentil
soup
made
with
sprouted
lentils
came
in
a
bowl
-
a
real
bowl
,
not
a
cup-sized
bowl
.
We
also
had
the
gyro
plate
which
was
satisfying
,
and
mousaka
entree
which
was
like
an
eggplant
,
potato
,
and
tomato
casserole
over
yellow
rice
.
By
itself
,
the
mousaka
would
last
me
two
additional
meals
.
We
could
n't
resist
the
Boston
creme
donut
,
which
turned
out
to
be
the
best
I
've
had
in
Madison
,
and
a
gigantic
cinnamon
roll
fritter
.
Plus
the
two
coffees
,
the
total
came
out
to
be
$
25
-LRB-
!!
-RRB-
and
some
change
.
The
service
is
a
relaxed
pace
,
but
the
owners
were
charming
and
seemed
to
enjoy
us
enjoying
their
food
.
My
five-star
ratings
often
depend
on
how
likely
and
how
often
I
would
return
,
and
this
place
definitely
makes
the
twice-a-month
cut.Donuts
as
BIG
as
your
head
!
Fresh
Lebanese
food
made
to
order
made
by
the
friendly
owner
!
Such
was
my
experience
today
at
People
's
Bakery
.
I
do
n't
really
understand
why
the
place
was
so
empty
today
but
it
was
fine
with
me
.
I
ordered
tabbouleh
,
baba
ghanoush
,
hummus
,
pita
and
a
giant
donut
!
You
'd
never
think
we
would
have
authentic
Lebanese
in
a
generic
looking
mini
mall
in
Wisconsin
but
we
do-I
feel
lucky
it
's
just
a
few
blocks
away
from
my
house
.
Downside
=
Styrofoam
containers
...
I
might
attempt
to
bring
my
own
next
time
to
avoid
them!Went
there
today
with
my
fiance
.
We
had
the
hummus
and
lamb
and
the
felafel
.
The
lamb
was
amazing
.
Little
pieces
cut
up
and
placed
on
a
bed
of
hummus
.
The
hummus
was
very
smooth
and
great
texture
.
The
hummus
was
good
,
but
Bunky
's
is
still
my
favorite
in
town
.
The
felafel
was
good
,
not
too
heavy
.
Serve
in
pita
bread
with
a
sauce
and
veggies
.
They
have
a
good
selection
of
beverages
,
they
had
my
favorite
Nantucket
Nectar
and
some
good
bottled
lemonade
.
After
our
main
course
we
decided
to
try
some
pastries
.
The
baklava
was
amazing
.
It
was
light
and
flavorful
.
We
also
had
a
french
glazed
doughnut
which
was
better
then
Greenbush
.
The
lady
that
works
the
counter
is
very
friendly
.
When
we
went
back
to
purchase
the
pastries
we
only
had
credit
cards
,
and
they
have
a
$
5
minimum
.
She
let
us
just
add
it
to
the
tip
of
our
original
bill!So
good
!!!
We
went
as
a
group
and
everyone
loved
the
food
they
ordered
.
The
food
was
very
reasonably
priced
!!
Yum!Stopped
here
a
few
times
for
the
yummy
baklava
.
I
've
eaten
lunch
here
once
and
it
was
fabulous
.
I
had
the
tan-tan
chicken
and
it
was
amazing
!
Moist
chicken
and
lovely
flavors.Herein
lie
the
finest
falafel
sandwiches
in
the
area
,
and
that
's
all
that
's
needed
to
justify
my
continuing
patronage
.
The
donuts
fill
the
display
cases
with
colors
,
and
fill
the
air
with
intoxicating
scents
.
So
many
different
shapes
and
sizes
,
but
the
freshness
and
delicacy
are
consistent
throughout
.
The
``
Rapid
Dozen
''
is
a
good
value
,
providing
a
diverse
sampling
of
donut
types
to
take
to
work
,
provided
they
make
it
that
far
.
Still
,
my
main
inspiration
behind
the
countless
visits
through
the
years
is
the
Lebanese
cuisine
,
and
specifically
the
falafel
.
You
will
find
plenty
of
tasty
dishes
,
from
hummus
and
babaganoush
,
to
kebabs
and
gyros
,
but
the
incomparable
falafel
stands
above
.
There
are
n't
,
truth
be
told
,
more
than
a
few
real
competitors
for
Madison
's
top
falafel
-LRB-
Banzo
is
also
great
,
then
it
drops
off
-RRB-
,
but
those
found
at
People
's
are
really
top
notch
,
competitive
with
any
I
've
had
throughout
the
country
.
The
prices
and
the
falafels
simply
can
not
be
beat
,
and
the
owners
are
incredibly
warm
and
friendly
people
who
have
been
crafting
joy
through
delicious
food
for
many
moons
now
.
There
is
nothing
to
keep
me
from
recommending
People
's
Bakery
with
the
full
five
stars.I
have
been
a
customer
for
years
.
Lunch
menu
is
excellent
.
I
stop
by
often
and
the
owners
are
very
accomdating
and
friendly
.
People
's
is
an
asset
to
Madison!Went
for
dinner
the
other
night
.
We
have
found
our
new
gyro
restaurant
!
Hubby
&
I
both
ordered
gyro
.
One
sammy
,
one
plate
.
Man
,
was
it
good
!
Took
a
raspberry
fritter
home
for
dessert
,
and
that
was
great
as
well
.
We
will
definitely
be
back!Living
1
block
away
is
dangerous
!
This
is
a
hidden
treasure
for
sure
.
The
owners
are
a
sweet
older
couple
who
knock
out
some
amazing
food
.
Ca
n't
speak
for
the
donuts
but
I
promise
you
will
enjoy
the
food
.
The
falafel
with
fries
is
a
bargain
--
5
bucks
or
so
--
and
it
will
be
made
totally
fresh
for
you
.
My
go
to
I
do
n't
feel
like
cooking
spot.What
do
you
get
when
you
combine
Lebanese
cuisine
,
baked
goods
,
gyros
,
funky
interior
design
and
second
hand
talk
of
bed
bugs
?
The
perfect
#yelpnewvember
storm
,
that
's
what
.
Over
the
summer
,
there
was
a
spirited
debate
about
where
to
find
the
best
gyros
in
town
after
the
unfortunate
demise
of
Dmitri
's
.
After
fellow
Yelper
Tawnie
R
boldly
declared
the
People
's
Bakery
as
the
worthy
successor
to
Dimitri
's
,
I
knew
a
trip
to
the
People
's
Bakery
was
in
the
cards
for
me
.
If
you
are
looking
for
elegant
digs
,
this
place
is
not
for
you
.
It
's
a
kitschy
,
little
greasy
spoon
nestled
into
a
strip
mall
at
the
corner
of
East
Wash
and
East
Johnson
.
There
's
not
a
lot
of
seating
and
if
someone
is
on
the
phone
,
you
're
going
to
be
privy
to
their
conversation
.
In
my
case
,
I
got
a
comprehensive
update
on
a
bedbug
infestation
of
a
family
member
that
the
owner
's
wife
was
describing
in
painstaking
detail
.
And
while
the
chairs
and
tables
are
mismatched
and
the
floor
tiles
are
coming
loose
in
places
,
the
eating
surfaces
were
all
impeccably
clean
and
the
pictures
on
the
wall
gave
the
joint
a
homey
feel
.
And
the
husband
and
wife
team
that
run
the
place
have
a
great
rapport
with
the
regular
customers
getting
their
lunch
fix
.
I
ordered
the
$
5.50
gyros
and
fries
and
grabbed
a
seat
.
About
ten
minutes
later
,
a
massive
foil
wrapped
gyros
was
delivered
to
my
table
.
I
swear
that
an
entire
herd
of
sheep
were
sacrificed
for
this
meal
.
In
terms
of
quantity
,
the
People
's
Bakery
delivered
big
time
.
On
the
quality
side
,
things
were
a
little
less
clear
cut
.
First
the
negatives
:
*
The
next
time
I
visit
,
I
'm
going
to
ask
to
have
the
pita
spend
a
little
time
on
the
grill
.
This
dish
deserves
better
than
a
cold
,
doughy
pita
.
*
More
tzatziki
sauce
please
!!!
When
you
give
me
a
metric
ton
of
lamb
meat
,
I
need
more
than
a
tablespoon
of
sauce
to
balance
out
the
dish
.
*
The
same
can
be
said
of
the
tomatoes
.
I
need
more
than
two
very
thinly
cut
slices
.
Now
the
positives
:
*
The
meat
was
served
piping
hot
,
moist
and
well
seasoned
.
It
was
clear
this
meat
was
n't
sitting
under
a
heat
lamp
awaiting
the
lunch
time
crush
.
The
only
thing
I
would
have
changed
is
to
have
a
little
char
on
some
of
the
pieces
to
provide
more
textural
contrast
.
*
The
onions
served
with
the
dish
were
pure
awesomeness
.
I
'll
be
honest
,
I
usually
pick
most
of
the
onions
off
my
gyros
because
they
can
overpower
the
other
ingredients
with
their
sulfuric
pungency
.
With
a
medium
dice
,
these
onions
were
fresh
and
sweet
and
complemented
each
bite
.
*
I
l-o-v-e-d
the
fries
that
accompanied
the
meal
.
Salty
and
crunchy
on
the
outside
and
hot
and
moist
on
the
outside
.
Yummmmmm
.
So
,
does
the
People
's
Bakery
unseat
Trader
Gus
as
my
King
of
Madison
Gyros
.
I
say
it
's
too
close
to
call
right
now
.
What
I
do
know
is
that
I
plan
to
return
to
the
People
's
Bakery
to
conduct
more
extensive
research
.
And
if
you
find
yourself
on
the
east
side
with
an
empty
stomach
and
a
light
wallet
,
People
's
Bakery
is
an
option
worth
considering.In
addition
to
sweet
treats
like
donuts
and
bear
claws
,
they
also
have
lunch
and
dinner
options
for
cheap
.
Falafel
is
not
the
best
in
town
,
but
try
the
gyro
,
which
comes
as
a
sandwich
or
entree
sized
plate
.
They
have
other
standard
Mediterranean
options
such
as
hummus
and
kebobs
.
Seating
is
limited
and
would
not
be
good
for
large
groups
.
Definitely
more
of
a
take-out
place
.
I
would
definitely
go
back
to
explore
their
menu.Solid
donut
shop
.
+
Nice
parking
lot
+
Great
selection
of
donuts
available
,
even
at
11:30
am
on
a
Sunday
-LRB-
most
other
places
are
sold
out
-RRB-
+
Totally
reasonable
prices
+
Donuts
are
good
;
I
'd
say
on
par
with
most
places
,
but
not
quite
as
good
as
Greenbush
-
Presentation/cabinet
could
use
some
work
-
very
narrow
space
and
it
's
nearly
impossible
to
see
what
's
availableSome
secrets
are
best
kept
secret
.
However
I
do
n't
want
my
new
donuts
find
going
out
of
business
anytime
soon
.
I
stumbled
across
this
little
gem
while
trying
to
find
some
real
donuts
for
my
wife
to
take
to
her
at
work
.
I
found
the
People
's
Bakery
.
The
donuts
selection
was
wonderful
.
The
wall
mentioned
some
other
baked
goods
as
you
walk
in
like
scones
,
but
those
are
no
longer
available
.
The
donuts
were
fantastic
.
So
good
that
I
had
to
go
back
today
and
they
are
still
fantastic
and
the
shelves
were
socked
full
at
9:30
am
with
plenty
of
choices
and
the
prices
are
great
.
To
be
honest
i
had
tunnel
vision
on
the
donuts
but
I
believe
they
have
some
other
things
to
offer
for
lunch
and
dinner.Their
food
and
pastries
are
good
,
but
most
importantly
they
had
the
best
baklava
I
've
ever
had.I
am
pretty
disappointed
with
this
place
.
After
it
being
described
as
the
best
gyro
in
town
,
I
was
let
down
.
The
gyro
is
good
and
it
is
only
$
4.50
.
However
,
best
in
town
?
Eh
.
They
forgot
my
tomatoes
.
There
is
nothing
really
terrible
about
this
place
,
but
it
was
just
``
ok
.
``
Great
stuffed
pizza
.
Great
price
for
so
much.Pretty
good
sandwiches
,
and
thin
crust
pizza
.
Dont
care
for
their
Chicago
deep
dish
,
stuffed
,
or
pan
style
pizza
,
because
it
tastes
like
they
use
margerine
in
the
crust
instead
of
half
margerine
,
half
butter
,
which
is
the
way
I
like
the
Chicago
deep
dish
crust
to
be
made
.
Try
the
Valentino
,
on
thin
crust
,
and
it
will
spin
your
cap
for
sure
,
and
they
have
a
good
italian
beef
sandwich
,
and
sausage
sandwich.Overall
,
its
a
bit
pricey
,
but
they
do
have
some
very
good
choices
.
They
also
charge
2.50
for
a
delivery
fee!I
must
say
perfect
...
I
travel
for
work
and
it
was
great
to
check
into
my
room
,
find
Rosati
's
on
Yelp
and
have
them
here
within
30
minutes
.
The
food
was
much
more
than
I
anticipated
...
A
MUST
try
.
Very
well
seasoned
and
the
service
was
great
from
the
phone
call
to
the
delivery
...
5
stars
all
around
!
The
Spinach
and
Tomato
Garlic
bread
was
delicious!I
love
their
thin
crust
pizza
but
I
always
feel
a
little
ripped
off
which
keeps
me
from
ordering
from
them
often
.
They
charge
a
steep
delivery
fee
which
if
not
taken
form
the
tip
makes
a
pizza
almost
28
bucks
.
Other
places
around
here
have
bullshit
delivery
fees
-LRB-
along
with
bitchy
statements
about
not
taking
the
fee
out
of
your
tip
,
as
if
the
person
buying
the
food
is
responsible
for
the
shitty
wage
the
store
pays
or
the
tacked
on
fee
that
apparently
does
not
actually
support
delivery
-RRB-
but
they
are
usually
less.I
kind
of
agree
with
Michael
R.
below
about
the
overall
quality
of
the
Food
Fight
restaurants
.
But
I
do
have
to
point
out
that
Food
Fight
is
based
in
Madison
,
and
operates
restaurants
only
here
,
so
it
is
``
local
.
''
As
for
``
independent
,
''
well
,
nine
restaurants
does
n't
make
a
very
big
chain
.
Ian
's
has
three
locations
and
has
overlapping
ownership
with
Gotham
Bagels
,
which
has
two
more
;
is
that
not
an
``
independent
''
restaurant
?
None
of
which
is
to
say
you
should
eat
at
these
restaurants
.
Tex
Tubb
's
Taco
Palace
is
OK
,
but
there
's
much
better
,
much
cheaper
Mexican
all
over
Madison
.
Hubbard
Avenue
Diner
serves
a
pretty
good
breakfast
but
disappointing
lunch
and
dinner
.
Bluephies
is
good
for
kids
but
I
'd
never
go
there
with
grownups
only
.
And
Fresco
actually
held
up
pretty
well
against
its
peers
the
one
time
I
ate
there
--
way
ahead
of
Cafe
Continental
and
a
little
behind
Magnus.The
restaurants
that
Food
Fight
offers
are
all
subpar
,
with
one
exception
of
Johnny
Delmonicos
.
Aside
from
the
Johnny
D
's
the
others
all
serve
incredibly
bad
food
.
I
tried
El
Dorado
's
once
and
it
was
terrible
,
on
top
of
things
they
charge
so
much
for
a
margerita
served
in
a
tiny
glass
its
ridiculous.I
have
been
a
food
fight
customer
and
visit
all
of
there
restaurants
on
a
regular
basis
.
My
favorite
is
Monty
's
blue
plate
.
The
meatless
loaf
of
the
gods
is
my
favorite
.
Have
tried
other
things
and
have
always
been
happy
.
Every
year
they
sell
gift
certificates
and
for
every
one
hundred
dollars
they
give
you
a
twenty
five
dollar
certificate
.
Ca
n't
beat
that
.
I
load
up
a
gift
card
with
five
hundred
and
eat
all
year
.
I
would
never
agree
with
the
people
that
have
bashed
their
places
.
Try
it
you
will
like
it.This
has
been
my
favorite
location
to
get
pizza
in
Madison
since
I
was
a
child
.
It
used
to
be
such
a
treat
to
get
those
pizza
twins
and
argue
over
the
toppings
with
my
sister
and
I
always
remember
being
thankful
when
i
had
it
.
Not
much
has
changed
since
,
other
than
the
fact
that
I
can
afford
it
eat
it
when
I
want
now
!
I
probably
order
from
there
5
to
7
times
a
month
on
average
and
I
ca
n't
forget
their
slices
which
they
have
available
from
-LRB-
11
to
2
-RRB-
.
I
'm
a
fan
of
the
inferno
wings
,
hell
all
of
the
chicken
there
is
above
satisfactory
in
my
estimation
.
The
Zesty
Djion
BBQ
sauce
is
one
of
a
kind
and
I
've
never
seen
it
replicated
in
any
other
restaurant
.
It
's
perfect
for
the
crust
and
chicken
alike
.
I
'll
admit
at
times
it
's
greasier
than
I
like
but
overall
it
's
one
of
my
favorite
pizzas
in
the
city
from
the
cheese
to
the
sauce.Just
ca
n't
get
decent
pizza
in
Wisconsin
...
sorry
...
but
someone
needs
to
head
down
to
Chicago
and
learn
how
to
make
a
pizza
.
This
place
piles
sauce
and
toppings
on
a
crust
that
ca
n't
support
it
.
you
end
up
with
a
slide
off
mess
.
Flimsy
crap.Grease
running
down
my
hand
.
That
's
a
first
.
Maybe
that
's
appealing
to
some
people
,
but
definitely
not
me
.
Sorry

The
pizza
here
is
OK
,
the
staff
here
is
friendly
,
and
they
have
good
daily
deals.The
lunch
buffet
from
11:30
to
3pm
is
crazy
delicious
!
Weekend
buffet
is
10
dollars

.
Try
a

of
this
and
that
,
take
what
you

leave
what
you
do

Great
food
,
good
service
.
I
recently
went
to
their
Odana
Rd
location
on
the
West
side
for
dinner
and
the
food
was
still
very
,
very
good
,
but
the
price
was
nuts
!
So
stick
with
the
lunch
buffet
and
you
will
have
happy
belly
and
happy
wallet.One
of
a
select
few
good
places
to
eat
on
the
far
East
side
of
town
.
I
mean
come
on
,
between
a
bunch
of
chain
restaurants
flanking
the
mall
and
Maharaja
,
there
's
no
comparison
.
Love
lunch
buffet
,
and
you
can
in
fact
grab
a
solid
dinner
as
well
.
Perfect
dinner
for
two
:
samosas
,
ginger
naan
,
bainghan
bartha
-LRB-
mashed
grilled
eggplant
mmm
-RRB-
,
and
mango
chicken
curry
.
The
service
is
very
courteous
for
dinner
,
they
drop
your
napkin
in
your
lap
and
you
get
a
hot
steaming
towel
after
your
meal
!
Extra
points
for
the
extremely
bass-heavy
hip
hop
gospel
music
coming
through
the
wall
from
Now
Faith
Ministries
next
door
.
They
have
one
helluva
sound
system
.
If
that
's
not
your
sort
of
thing
,
then
avoid
typical
church
hours
.

Excellent
lunch
buffet
,
quick
service.Love
this
place
.
Their
lunch
buffet
is
great
.
So
is
their
dinner
menu
.
My
partner
and
I
went
there
for
dinner
on
New
Years
Eve
and
for
Valentines
Day
,
we
had
so
much
fun
.
It
is
a
relaxed
atmosphere
and
they
have
great
food
.
I
recommend
the
Tikki
Masala.Tired
of
``
phone-it-in
''
lunch
buffets
,
with
the
same
6
dishes
day
after
day
?
Then
Maharaja
might
get
you
out
of
your
funk
.
I
've
been
to
their
lunch
buffet
about
5
times
,
and
EVERY
time
there
is
a
new
dish
or
two
that
I
've
never
seen
before
.
Great
price
on
the
lunch
.
Wonderful
dessert
selection
.
Good
variety
between
meaty
and
veggie
dishes
.
Love
the
goat
curry
.
If
you
like
Indian
food
at
all
,
you
ca
n't
go
wrong
with
a
lunch
at
Maharaja
.
-LRB-
And
for
facebookers
...
No
,
I
did
NOT
eat
4
times
tonight
.
Just
catching
up
on
some
restaurants
that
deserve
a
good
review
.
-RRB-
The
buffet
is
ok
,
but
I
came
back
for
dinner
and
the
specific
items
are
very
good
.
I
had
a
vegetable
korma
and
a
chickpea
curry
.
Samosas
were
super
.
Chutney
could
have
been
a
bit
spicyer
,
but
hotness
on
the
food
at
medium
was
quite
good
.
Go
here
for
dinner
.
Yum
.
They
had
as
special
,
2
entrees
,
nan
,
rice
and
popadom
for
$
20
.
I
have
drove
past
this
place
a
thousand
times
,
and
never
realized
it
was
even
here
.
I
did
n't
discover
my
deep
and
passionate
love
of
Nepalese
food
until
moving
up
to
the
Twin
Cities
,
but
over
break
my
dearest
mother
suggested
we
go
to
the
Maharaja
on
the
east
side
.
``
On
the
east
side
?
''
I
scoffed
,
foolishly
.
``
There
is
nothing
but
chain
food
and
malls
on
the
east
side
!
''
I
know
this
statement
fairly
well
,
as
we
grew
up
20
minutes
east
of
the
east
side
of
Madison
,
making
a
trip
downtown
quite
a
hike
.
But
she
assured
me
that
it
was
in
fact
on
the
east
side
.
And
not
on
the
east
side
like
...
Ella
's
Deli
is
on
the
east
side
.
This
thing
is
on
the
East
Side
as
in
East
Towne
Mall
is
on
the
East
Side
.
So
,
reluctantly
,
I
went
in
.
AND
WAS
GREETED
WITH
AWESOME
.
This
buffet
was
amazing
.
They
had
a
coconut
soup
which
was
great
,
all
of
the
chicken
dishes
were
great
,
they
had
a
wide
variety
of
veg
dishes
...
I
was
so
stunned
and
amazed
.
Even
though
I
did
n't
partake
,
they
served
strawberry
lassi
...
mmm
!
Finished
off
with
some
mango
ice
cream
,
I
could
n't
have
been
more
impressed
.
Whenever
I
visit
home
,
I
always
drag
my
family
along
to
Maharaja
.
Delicious
,
and
a
good
price
.
All
the
staff
are
very
friendly
too
!!
This
is
it
-
the
cream
of
the
crop
.
I
've
lived
in
the
Madison
area
for
the
past
two
years
,
have
visited
many
of
the
local
Indian
buffets
,
and
have
found
none
that
equal
the
Maharaja
standard
.
Buffet
dishes
change
on
a
daily
basis
,
but
you
can
always
count
on
their
show-stopping
chicken
tikka
masala
to
be
in
the
mix
.
In
addition
to
the
standard
meat
curries
and
tandoori
chicken
,
they
always
offer
multiple
vegetarian
dishes
and
an
array
of
appetizers
.
Recommendations
:
coconut
soup
,
vegetable
korma
,
malai
kofta
,
baingan
bhartha
,
chicken
tikka
masala
,
mango
ice
cream
The
staff
is
wonderful
and
always
keeps
plates
of
naan
a
plenty
:-RRB-
Maharaja
is
by
far
one
of
Madison
's
best
restaurants
.
And
,
you
ca
n't
beat
their
lunch
buffet
deal
-LRB-
under
$
10
-RRB-
.
But
diners
beware
,
it
is
incredibly
easy
to
overeat
at
this
place
...
forcing
one
into
an
almost
immediate
food
coma
upon
settling
the
check.This
place
had
its
awards
placed
up
near
the
entrance
,
so
they
can
say
they
're
awesome
.
But
,
these
awards
are
outdated
.
Remember
one
that
was
dated
back
in
2008
.
No
2010
yet
.
ha
.
Had
the
Tandoori
chicken
and
the
Lamb
curry
.
The
lamb
curry
was
awesome
,
although
not
enough
lamb
chunks
.
The
tandoori
was
excellent
and
spicy
.
Had
a
side
order
of
naan
too
.
Delicious
!
But
expect
to
pay
a
good
amount
.
Its
quite
good
and
the
awards
do
n't
lie.The
staff
here
make
the
experience
.
Since
I
am
not
a
fan
of
buffets
,
I
can
only
tell
you
about
the
meals
here
.
DELICIOUS
.
I
do
n't
eat
meat
,
my
boyfriend
almost
only
eats
meat
,
we
both
found
things
we
loved
.
it
was
the
best
!
We
liked
to
eat
here
once
a
week
since
it
was
so
amazing.I
'm
not
usually
a
fan
of
buffets
,
but
Maharajah
's
lunch
buffet
was
quite
enjoyable
.
I
tried
small
amounts
of
a
variety
of
dishes
and
sauces
and
all
were
tasty
.
Their
stuffed
eggplant
special
and
goat
curry
were
super
.
The
food
seemed
to
be
recently
made
as
it
was
not
dried
out
or
overcooked.Sorry
I
am
indian
and
as
a
indian
this
place
blows
.
.
Their
aloo
parathas
are
a
cop
out
the
just
use
samosa
filling
for
the
stuffing
...
The
spicy
pickles
are
from
a
can
,
also
their
vegetable
curry
is
made
with
frozen
vegetables
not
fresh
...
Also
I
know
its
not
a
authentic
place
when
the
serve
beef
...
No
authentic
place
will
ever
serve
beef
,
they
will
serve
goat
,
lamb
,
chicken
and
every
animal
except
beef
...
what
else
,
oh
yea
two
of
the
servers
started
chewing
each
other
out
in
the
back
of
the
room
where
EVERYONE
could
here
...
Also
they
should
invest
in
making
``
chaat
''
food
-
street
food
of
india
.
.
they
had
none
of
that
one
the
menu
!
I
will
give
it
1
star
because
the
garlic
naan
was
good
.
.
Also
our
waiter
was
really
nice
it
was
some
guy
who
moved
here
from
SD
...
Save
your
indian
food
craving
and
head
down
to
ChicagoI
am
not
sure
what
I
like
for
Indian
food
but
this
was
damn
good.Pretty
good
lunch
buffet
,
theres
alot
of
vegetarian
choices
if
you
stick
to
a
certain
kind
of
diet
like
myself
.
I
eat
only
Halal
meat
.
I
have
n't
asked
if
any
of
the
meat
on
buffet
was
halal
only
because
I
do
n't
want
to
make
a
fuss
.
I
will
however
call
ahead
and
see
if
they
are
serving
any
Halal
meat
before
I
decide
to
dine
for
dinner
.
Sometimes
they
have
Chicken
and
Goat
but
sometimes
only
goat
.
As
far
as
authenticity
goes
,
I
ca
n't
personally
say
because
I
am
not
south
asian
.
That
being
said
,
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
complains
alot
that
there
is
no
authentic
south
asian
restaurants
in
Madison
.
This
how
ever
does
not
take
away
from
the
tastiness
that
I
have
experienced
at
Maharaja
.
They
have
satisfying
dishes
that
come
in
satisfying
portions
.
If
you
dare
to
go
to
the
spicy
side
of
the
spectrum
they
are
constantly
filling
your
water
,
which
is
awesome
.
You
do
n't
want
to
be
left
without
water
when
the
burn
becomes
too
much
.
You
can
ask
for
not
so
spicy
though
;-RRB-
The
only
not
so
great
thing
I
've
ever
had
here
was
the
Cheese
pakora
,
they
kind
of
seemed
like
they
were
pre
made
-LRB-
as
in
frozen
-RRB-
and
not
fresh
.
That
was
the
only
thing
,
ever
,
in
all
the
times
I
've
been
to
Maharaja
.
Both
east
and
west
locations
have
awesome
service
and
tasty
main
dishes.You
'll
be
treated
like
royalty
at
the
Maharaja
.
I
first
came
upon
this
place
by
chance
.
I
was
in
town
for
work
and
noticed
that
there
was
an
Indian
restaurant
nearby
.
After
reading
the
great
reviews
on
Yelp
,
I
knew
I
had
to
try
it
for
myself
.
I
ordered
the
Chicken
TIkka
Masala
along
with
Naan
bread
and
a
cup
of
chai
.
I
ordered
the
food
to
be
Indian
hot
.
The
waiter
replied
,
``
I
like
your
confidence
!
''
It
was
very
tasty
and
hot
just
as
I
like
it
.
The
restaurant
was
well
kept
,
the
staff
treat
the
guests
as
royalty
so
the
service
is
wonderful
,
and
the
prices
are
decent
for
what
you
're
getting
.
Do
n't
forget
to
stop
by
the
Indian
grocery
that
is
located
next
door
to
this
location
!
It
has
a
large
selection
of
items
so
that
you
can
make
your
own
Indian
dinner
at
home
.
Will
I
be
back
the
next
time
I
'm
in
town
?
Absolutely.We
did
takeout
and
we
ended
up
with
large
portions
of
excellent
chicken
tikka
masala
,
garlic
naan
and
veggie
pakora
and
they
gave
us
free
chai
for
the
road!I
have
a
new
found
love
for
Indian
food
and
when
I
found
myself
in
Madison
I
had
to
check
this
place
out
.
It
was
most
excellently
delicious
!
The
staff
was
very
nice
and
the
price
for
3
people
including
4
drinks
and
an
appetizer
was
about
$
75
.
If
you
ever
find
yourself
on
the
East
side
of
Madison
,
you
should
really
check
this
place
out.The
food
here
is
good
.
My
husband
and
I
are
new
to
Indian
food
,
so
I
ca
n't
speak
to
its
authenticity
or
how
good
it
is
in
comparison
to
other
Indian
food
,
but
overall
we
really
liked
the
food
here
.
The
chicken
tikka
masala
was
particularly
delicious
,
though
there
were
lots
of
very
good
options
at
the
buffet
.
The
naan
was
also
good
-LRB-
and
needed
to
cool
the
mouth
every
so
often
-RRB-
.
The
service
was
okay
!
Nothing
good
or
bad
to
say
there
.
The
inside
was
really
not
all
that
awesome
.
That
was
the
major
part
that
brought
down
the
experience
for
us
;
it
looked
like
it
could
do
with
a
face-lift
.
The
decor
was
ok
.
Nothing
special
but
there
were
some
odd
mylar
stars
and
hot
air
balloons
hanging
from
the
ceiling
Came
in
for
dinner
and
there
are
two
other
tables
at
8:00
on
a
Thursday
night
.
I
wonder
if
people
go
to
bed
early
around
this
neighborhood
or
if
this
place
just
is
n't
that
popular
.
Coconut
soup
was
weird
.
A
mix
of
hot
coconut
milk
that
's
been
watered
down
and
then
laden
with
sweetened
baking
coconut
from
a
bag
.
This
was
definitely
not
fresh
coconut
in
any
way
and
I
found
this
soup
to
be
disapointing
.
Lamb
Saag
was
about
as
much
lamb
as
you
might
expect
for
a
dish
costing
12.95
.
It
's
uniform
liquidey
sludge
was
a
little
too
reminiscent
of
diarrhea
for
me
and
I
lost
a
little
of
my
appetite
,
though
the
lamb
was
tender
and
cooked
well
.
The
overall
dish
was
very
very
salty
with
no
special
taste
.
Just
a
little
spicy
,
a
little
Indian
,
and
a
little
lamb
.
They
are
probably
using
curry
paste
from
a
jar
,
or
there
is
just
not
a
very
imaginative
cook
in
the
kitchen
because
the
whole
dish
was
lacking
in
flavor
-LRB-
besides
salt
-RRB-
.
A
whole
cardamom
pod
was
left
hidden
in
the
diarrhea
sludge
,
which
led
to
an
unpleasant
burst
of
cardamom
in
one
bite
.
Rice
had
clearly
been
sitting
around
for
awhile
and
was
very
dry
throughout
with
crunchy
bits
and
very
chewy
bits
.
I
just
do
n't
see
how
this
is
acceptable
to
serve
someone
in
a
restaurant
.
Rice
is
one
of
the
cheapest
ingredients
out
there
.
If
the
rice
has
been
sitting
for
too
long
,
throw
it
out
and
make
more
.
I
tried
the
saag
with
the
rice
and
the
oily
mess
of
lamb
Saag
rehydrated
the
rice
somewhat
,
and
the
rice
's
absorption
of
the
Saag
took
away
some
of
its
saltiness
.
Three
sauces
or
chutneys
that
came
with
the
papadom
were
not
very
good
at
all
.
Had
to
ask
to
have
my
water
glass
filled
every
single
time
I
finished
it
.
-LRB-
this
is
a
major
pet
peeve
-RRB-
Excellent
,
excellent
!
Very
impressed
with
their
assorted
curry
dishes
.
Highly
recommend
.
Do
n't
expect
fancy
atmosphere
.
The
staff
moves
at
their
own
pace
but
that
does
n't
matter
when
the
food
is
soooo
good.We
went
for
the
buffet
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
and
are
so
glad
we
decided
to
give
it
a
try
!
My
husband
's
favorite
is
Chicken
Tikka
Massala
-
which
they
had
on
the
buffet
.
I
'm
pretty
new
to
Indian
food
,
but
there
were
so
many
options
and
so
many
things
I
liked
!
The
service
was
amazing
!
Our
water
glasses
were
constantly
full
,
which
is
good
considering
some
of
the
food
is
really
spicy
!
We
're
not
from
that
area
,
but
if
we
were
in
the
neighborhood
,
I
would
consider
going
there
again!What
a
great
find
!
As
several
others
have
pointed
out
,
the
decor
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
-
nor
even
to
dwell
on
it
in
a
Yelp
review
,
but
It
has
always
been
my
contention
that
if
you
offer
great
food
at
a
fair
price
and
are
not
offering
a
dining
experience
,
then
restaurant
cleanliness
and
an
attentive
wait
staff
is
a
better
investment
than
wood
carvings
and
mood
lighting
.
We
came
for
lunch
and
it
turned
out
they
had
a
fantastic
buffet
!
Everything
from
tandoori
chicken
to
palak
aloo
.
Every
dish
was
so
flavorful
and
authentic
.
Having
spent
two
years
overseas
where
I
associated
with
several
Indians
,
I
know
they
would
have
been
suitably
impressed
.
The
waiter
brought
naan
to
the
table
and
was
there
when
our
water
glasses
emptied
.
He
did
n't
hover
but
he
was
attentive
.
My
lunch
partner
and
I
got
a
kick
out
of
the
sign
that
politely
let
buffet
eaters
know
we
were
welcome
to
the
food
but
would
be
charged
for
waste
.
It
should
go
without
saying
,
but
I
have
been
to
several
all-you-can-eat
buffets
and
have
witnessed
first
hand
the
amount
of
leftover
food
that
has
to
be
thrown
away
because
people
take
too
much
.
Personally
I
think
part
of
the
blame
should
be
placed
on
the
cooks/managers
for
not
putting
out
a
better
product
,
but
certainly
the
customer
is
largely
to
blame
.
Hence
,
a
sign
that
clearly
articulates
the
Maharaja
's
expectation
of
its
customers
is
a
good
thing
.
Let
's
face
it
,
if
the
food
was
bad
,
the
customer
would
be
screaming
...
Bottom
line
,
Eat
here
if
you
love
Indian
food.At
tha
advice
of
the
reviews
on
yelp
,
my
family
decided
to
try
out
this
restaurant
.
Excellent
food
at
decent
prices
.
If
you
like
Indian
food
,
I
would
highly
recommend
that
you
eat
here.I
was
in
town
on
business
and
had
a
free
night
so
I
decided
to
give
Maharaja
a
try
.
I
had
the
Mulligatawny
Soup
,
Garlic
Naan
,
and
the
Tandoori
Chicken
.
The
food
was
really
good
-LRB-
awesome
Naan
!
-RRB-
and
the
portions
were
quite
large
.
The
chicken
was
out-of-this-world
and
I
could
not
finish
it
all
.
The
only
negative
was
the
service
.
I
dined
on
a
Tuesday
evening
at
6:30
ish
.
It
took
a
long
time
for
my
waiter
to
take
my
order
.
Though
the
place
seemed
relatively
full
.
There
were
only
two
waitstaff
.
When
i
arrived
,
there
seemed
to
be
several
employees
outside
smoking
.
Also
,
My
waiter
was
not
of
Indian
descent
,
which
is
perfectly
fine
,
but
he
did
not
speak
English
,
thus
my
questions
about
the
menu
and
what
he
recommended
went
unanswered
.
It
also
took
a
long
time
for
my
food
to
arrive
.
From
the
time
I
sat
down
to
the
time
my
food
arrived
was
almost
an
hour
.
All-in-all
,
I
would
go
back
again
because
the
food
was
very
good
.
I
would
have
given
4
stars
,
save
for
the
awful
customer
service.I
went
here
at
the
suggestion
of
several
people
who
told
me
how
great
the
food
was
.
I
admit
my
experience
with
Indian
cuisine
is
limited
,
but
for
the
most
part
pleasant
,
so
I
thought
it
was
worth
a
try
.
The
food
was
outstanding
!
I
ordered
Aloo
Ghobi
.
Really
flavorful
and
spicy
.
I
do
n't
know
if
this
is
commonplace
everywhere
,
but
since
I
moved
up
from
Texas
it
's
been
really
difficult
to
order
a
dish
and
be
satisfied
with
the
level
of
heat
.
Here
they
asked
if
I
preferred
mild
or
hot
,
when
I
said
hot
,
they
asked
how
hot
,
I
said
very
and
they
definitely
delivered
.
My
husband
ordered
the
tandoori
chicken
which
is
a
very
generaously
sized
portion
.
It
comes
out
on
what
looks
like
a
small
griddle
,
steaming
,
with
peppers
and
lemon
slices
.
They
also
brought
out
a
big
bowl
of
white
rice
along
with
some
Naan
bread
that
we
asked
for
.
All
in
all
,
it
was
a
very
satisfying
experience
and
we
will
definitely
be
going
back
!
Service
can
be
a
little
slow
,
but
the
staff
are
very
attentive
and
helpful
.
They
're
also
really
good
at
refilling
drinks
,
I
know
it
seemed
like
our
server
kept
refilling
my
glass
every
time
I
took
a
sip.I
ca
n't
say
enough
good
things
about
this
place
!
My
husband
,
son
and
I
go
there
at
least
once
a
month
and
it
is
always
delicious
and
they
take
such
good
care
of
you
!
Some
restaurants
look
at
you
when
you
walk
in
with
a
little
one
and
grimace
they
are
always
joking
with
our
son
and
making
him
,
and
us
,
feel
very
comfortable
!
The
food
is
SOOO
good
-
not
a
bad
thing
on
the
menu
!
If
you
're
looking
for
a
great
Indian
meal
in
a
great
atmosphere
with
fantastic
staff
this
is
the
place!Our
family
went
to
celebrate
a
birthday
with
an
Indian
dinner
-
there
were
6
of
us
in
our
happy
group
.
We
have
been
going
to
the
Maharaja
for
years
,
to
enjoy
the
lunch
buffets
,
Valentines
Day
,
birthdays
etc.
.
Tonight
the
food
was
good
,
but
the
service
was
an
issue
.
To
start
,
we
could
see
that
the
staff
had
changed
.
The
service
took
a
long
time
,
even
though
there
were
only
5
tables
with
customers
and
six
wait
staff
.
The
server
did
not
understand
English
well
enough
to
properly
place
the
order
,
so
there
was
extra
wine
for
one
person
.
Also
,
the
glassware
and
flatware
were
spotted
,
with
some
that
needed
to
be
sent
back
.
The
service
had
really
changed
for
the
worse
.
The
server
would
clear
one
dirty
plate
,
then
wander
off
,
return
five
minutes
later
to
get
another
and
so
on
.
The
Manager
or
owner
really
needs
to
train
the
staff
.
They
were
all
working
,
but
seemed
unclear
as
to
who
was
responsible
for
what
duties
.
We
also
ordered
ice
cream
and
a
special
birthday
dessert
,
while
very
tasty
-
the
service
was
vey
slow
,
at
least
10
minutes
from
the
time
the
ice
cream
was
ordered
to
served
.
What
really
put
us
over
the
top
was
when
they
refused
to
accept
their
own
$
50
Gift
Certificate
that
they
sold
to
me
in
June
towards
the
$
160
bill
-LRB-
not
including
tip
-RRB-
.
It
had
only
been
approximately
6
weeks
.
Apparently
,
this
location
has
been
sold
.
The
old
owners
still
own
the
location
on
Odana
Rd
-LRB-
same
name
-RRB-
,
but
not
this
one
.
Therefore
,
they
would
not
accept
their
own
gift
certificate
and
told
us
,
we
could
use
it
at
Odana
Rd.
.
Interestingly
,
they
still
kept
the
Best
of
Madison
sign
on
the
door
for
the
old
ownership
,
they
will
need
to
take
this
down
.
Again
,
we
were
surprised
at
the
business
decision
about
their
own
gift
certificate.Authentic
Indian
in
Madison
,
Wisconsin
.
Score!The
neighborhood
felt
a
little
sketchy
,
and
as
a
solo
diner
,
my
service
was
n't
very
good
.
Food
was
OK
though.My
husband
and
I
came
today
with
a
group
of
14
people
for
their
Sunday
lunch
buffet
and
I
have
to
say
,
for
the
price
,
excellent
service
and
quality
of
food
,
I
really
recommend
this
place
!
I
called
ahead
and
they
allowed
our
group
to
have
a
semi-private
room
away
from
the
restaurant
but
close
to
the
buffet
.
The
buffet
had
all
the
dishes
you
would
hope
for
and
some
unexpected
ones
as
well
!
I
really
enjoyed
the
chicken
tikka
,
chana
masala
,
samosa
and
more
common
dishes
...
but
they
also
had
a
goat
dish
,
fish
,
several
biryanis
,
really
nice
chutneys
,
etc.
.
My
only
complaint
about
this
place
was
that
the
naan
was
n't
in
a
basket
with
a
napkin
to
keep
it
warm
...
it
was
just
plopped
on
a
plate
and
got
cold
quickly
.
The
naan
was
great
and
deserves
to
be
kept
warm
!
The
dessert
section
of
the
buffet
had
a
ton
of
variety
but
the
mango
ice
cream
was
superb
.
Apparently
,
when
you
order
a
meal
during
the
week
-LRB-
even
take
away
!
-RRB-
,
everyone
gets
a
mango
ice
cream
as
well
.
The
food
was
excellent
but
the
mango
ice
cream
will
bring
me
back!Friday

Great
Fish

All
you
can
eat
ocean
perch
.
Big
bowls
of
slaw
,
tartar
sauce
,
and
lemon
chunks
on
the

Dignified
and
refined
,
I
would
n't
eat
perch
anywhere
else
in
Madison.Old-timey
fern
bar
with
a
fish
fry
like
you
used
to
enjoy
with
Grandma
.
Like
the
other
reviewers
,
I
order
the
ocean
perch
which
comes
family
style
with
crinkle-cut
fries
!
This
place
is
so
good
I
make
the
destination
of
my
twice-yearly
meat
craving
!
-LRB-
That
's
right
-
I
consider
fish
meat
.
-RRB-
Do
n't
sweat
the
wait
you
are
likely
to
encounter
-LRB-
even
if
you
and
Gram
get
there
at
4:30
-RRB-
.
The
bartenders
make
a
delightful
spicy
Bloody
Mary
,
which
helps
add
to
the
overall
feeling
that
have
I
reached
retirement
age.Here
's
a
place
with
a
lot
of
potential
,
the
bar
area
is
dark
and
old
boys
club
in
feel
,
with
a
large
oval
bar
.
The
drinks
were
``
healthy
''
and
reasonably
priced
.
Its
definately
an
older
supperclubby
feel
,
but
in
a
warm
,
comfortable
,
cardigan
sweater
on
a
cold
winter
day
sort
of
way
.
The
big
downfall
here
was
the
food
.
I
had
heard
good
things
and
maybe
I
just
was
there
on
an
off
day
,
but
my
meal
was
a
filet
with
breaded
shrimp
and
stuffed
potato
and
none
of
it
lived
up
to
expectations
.
The
steak
was
so
raw
I
could
only
eat
the
edges
,
the
breaded
shrimp
were
more
bread
than
shrimp
and
the
potato
reminded
me
of
a
christmas
bunt
cake
and
not
in
a
good
way
.
Ill
give
them
another
chance
because
we
were
with
a
big
group
and
even
the
best
restaurants
have
off
days
,
but
at
our
table
we
all
had
similar
thoughts
on
the
food
.
And
to
be
fair
I
didnt
ask
for
any
adjustments
,
the
management
seemed
very
accomodating
to
guests
in
the
bar
and
dining
areas.As
a
Wisconsin
native
,
Friday
fish
fries
have
always
been
a
big
part
of
my
life
.
When
living
in
Madison
years
ago
,
we
used
to
hit
all
the
great
fish
fries
on
the
lakes
around
town
.
And
while
spending
10
years
in
Hayward
,
we
used
to
live
for
Fridays
at
Lost
Land
Lake
Lodge
and
later
The
Waterfront
.
Living
in
Utah
for
over
20
years
,
my
opportunities
are
few
and
far
between
.
So
I
was
excited
to
have
a
free
Friday
in
Madison
to
try
the
very
best
.
Reading
online
reviews
,
going
off
my
past
knowledge
and
talking
to
friends
,
I
made
the
tough
call
between
the
Avenue
Bar
-LRB-
one
of
my
favorite
lunch
spots
-RRB-
and
the
Esquire
Club
.
We
chose
the
Esquire
.
I
had
n't
been
in
the
club
in
probably
30-35
years
.
Overall
,
it
was
a
good
experience
.
But
it
was
n't
close
to
the
level
to
which
I
'm
accustomed
to
in
Hayward
on
our
three
or
four
trips
out
there
a
year
.
We
had
a
great
time
and
I
highly
recommend
it
,
but
we
would
make
another
choice
next
time
.
The
bar
at
Kavanaugh
's
Esquire
Club
is
great
-
a
full
horseshoe
with
plenty
of
seating
.
We
arrived
around
5:30
p.m.
on
a
Friday
in
Lent
.
It
was
packed
already
,
as
was
every
spot
in
the
parking
lot
.
We
put
our
name
in
and
were
told
it
would
be
20
minutes
for
our
party
of
two
.
We
were
seated
in
just
ten
.
One
of
the
challenges
with
the
Esquire
is
it
just
does
n't
have
a
lot
of
natural
atmosphere
.
The
main
room
with
the
bar
is
fabulous
.
But
the
other
dining
rooms
are
really
plain
with
not
a
single
thing
on
the
wall
.
The
table
settings
are
nice
.
And
outside
,
it
's
a
totally
blah
building
.
Out
the
back
door
to
the
parking
lot
was
an
attractive
collection
of
a
few
hundred
cigarette
butts
sitting
on
the
sidewalk
and
snowbank
.
The
tables
are
pre-set
with
great
,
fresh
rye
bread
and
fabulous
cole
slaw
.
And
we
had
quick
attention
from
our
waitress
.
The
host
gave
us
menus
-
actually
three
stapled
,
photocopied
sheets
-
pretty
tacky
-LRB-
I
noticed
others
did
get
regular
menus
-RRB-
.
It
's
a
full
supper
club
menu
with
multiple
choices
for
fish
fry
.
We
opted
for
the
$
9.95
all-you-can-eat
ocean
perch
.
What
was
notable
to
me
as
that
the
current
Web
page
for
Esquire
lists
the
price
at
$
8.95
.
Not
good
.
Cod
was
also
available
at
a
slightly
higher
price
.
The
bread
and
slaw
kept
us
entertained
and
both
were
world
class
.
A
heaping
plate
of
fish
and
crinkle
fries
arrived
in
good
time
-LRB-
beating
the
Coke
our
grandson
ordered
15
minutes
earlier
-RRB-
.
We
had
to
ask
for
lemons
.
The
fish
was
very
good
-
I
love
perch
.
But
as
good
as
it
was
,
it
simply
was
n't
at
the
presentation
and
taste
level
of
what
we
traditionally
get
at
The
Waterfront
in
Hayward
,
for
example
.
It
was
a
simple
cornbread-type
breading
that
was
good
,
but
somewhat
uninteresting
-
not
the
flamboyant
texture
of
the
beer
battered
fish
we
have
grown
to
expect
.
Nonetheless
,
we
polished
off
the
fish
,
got
a
few
more
fries
and
a
chocolate
mousse
desert
.
The
bill
for
two
with
a
few
beers
and
desert
was
just
under
$
40
.
Later
that
night
,
we
also
hit
the
Beachhouse
in
McFarland
,
another
popular
local
spot
.
My
wife
had
dinner
there
with
a
friend
.
This
is
an
awesome
place
with
a
ton
of
atmosphere
and
great
fish
.

for

fish

at
this
level
is
outstandingDetermined
to
find
the
best
darned
fish
fry
in
Madison
,
our
``
Friday
Night
Fish
Fry
Fanatics
''
decided
to
try
the
Esquire
Club
on
Sherman
.
We
grabbed
a
seat
at
the
large
,
oval
,
darkwooded
bar
,
and
ordered
a
couple
of
Spotted
Cows
.
We
were
told
it
would
be
about
20
minutes
to
seat
our
small
group
,
and
that
was
just
fine
.
The
bar
was
cozy
,
the
beers
fresh
,
and
the
service
attentive
,
friendly
,
and
helpful
.
Soon
enough
,
our
name
was
called
and
we
were
seated
in
one
of
the
``
auxillary
''
dining
areas
.
Clearly
an
add-on
,
not
a
single
decoration
,
but
definitely
welcomed
;
the
place
was
packed
and
we
were
seated
quickly
,
so
it
's
all
good
by
me
.
Our
waitress
took
our
orders
and
brought
us
a
round
of
Whiskey
Old
Fashioned
Sours
.
We
gnoshed
on
the
deliciously
fresh
rye
bread
,
which
was
unlike
any
other
rye
I
've
had
.
It
featured
a
very
mild
rye
flavor
and
a
very
light
texture
.
It
was
delicious
.
Fish
arrived
within
minutes
:
fried
ocean
perch
and
battered
cod
,
one
order
of
fries
,
and
two
orders
of
cheesy
hashbrowns
-LRB-
cost
an
extra
$
2
per
-RRB-
.
The
fried
ocean
perch
is
all
you
can
eat
,
and
it
's
fresh
,
lightly
breaded
,
flavorful
,
grease-free
,
and
easily
some
of
the
best
fish
I
've
had
at
a
fish
fry
.
I
scarfed
down
three
heaping
plates
,
and
I
do
mean
``
heaping
.
''
They
're
not
skimpy
with
the
refills
.
Battered
cod
was
equally
good
,
but
it
was
n't
all
you
can
eat
.
Three
large
,
beautifully
brown
,
battered
and
flaky
filets
are
what
you
get
.
Fries
were
outstanding
as
well
;
crinkle
cut
,
fresh
,
hot
,

.
Yum
.
Hashbrowns
were
cooked
perfectly
but
the

At
first
,
I
loved
the
Esquire
Club
for
how
old-fashioned
its
style
and
clientele
were
.
This
is
the
closest
I
've
had
to
a
Wisconsin
supper
club
,
and
in
the
winter
,
it
seems
especially
comfy
.
But
,
the
food
--
outside
of
a
couple
items
--
is
really
substandard
.
Never
,
ever
,
ever
,
get
a
``
broiled
''
icelandic
cod
,
it
comes
charred
to
a
crisp
.
The
lake
perch
is
fine
.
But
,
that
's
about
it
,
really
.
Simple
presentation
and
simple
food
,
but
it
never
elevates
to
the
level
of
being
phenomenal.My
semi-local
friend
thought
nothing
would
be
more
authentically
Wisconsin
than
a
Friday
Night
Fish
Fry
.
After
overdosing
on
spam
&
corned
beef
hash
for
the
past
week
,
I
was
down
for
something
local
so
I
gladly
obliged
.
Wood-paneling
and
dim
lighting
make
the
main
bar
warm
&
inviting
.
Packed
with
locals
,
which
is
always
a
good
sign
.
Strong
brandy
old-fashioned
.
Only
downer
was
the
downstairs
dining
area
--
kinda
felt
like
a
church
bingo
hall
.
Soft
,
tender
&
delicious
bread
,
oddly
sweet
coleslaw
.
Fried
cheese
curds
were
good
--
moderately
breaded
,
not
greasy
,
smooth
texture
but
not
squeaky
.
Family
style
ocean
perch
was
satisfying
but
not
memorable
.
Un
-LRB-
der
-RRB-
seasoned
but
not
greasy
,
breading
a
little
thicker
than
desired
.
Crinkle-cut
fries
were
great
but
also
needed
salt
.
Tartar
sauce
was
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
mayo
.
Still
ate
a
ton
and
did
n't
have
room
for
dessert
.
Overall
,
excellent
deep
frying
skills
but
might
need
a
refresher
course
in
seasoning
.
Great
atmosphere
;
easy
to
see
why
they
have
such
a
strong
following.Got
take
out
here
tonight
and
I
love
myself
some
Wisconsin
Fish
Fry
.
We
ordered
the
Lake
Perch
and
The
Cod
,
with
baked
potatoes
.
It
was
great
.
The
Lake
Perch
was
light
and
small
but
with
many
pieces-delish-more
than
enough
.
I
did
n't
eat
the
cod
but
my
relative
said
it
was
good
but
not
as
good
as
my
perch
.
The
bake
potatoes
were
excellent
,
large
,
cooked
perfectly
and
yummy
.
The
Rye
Bread
is
a
nice
touch
and
it
was
great
.
Slaw
,
tart
sauce
and
sour
cream
were
all
added
in
a
nice
box
.
I
ordered
and
they
were
available
in
10
minutes
.
The
woman
on
the
phone
was
great
and
the
woman
that
rang
me
out
was
great
and
friendly
,
considering
that
she
was
dealing
with
an
overflow
house
.
I
will
be
back
soon.I
read
the
new
ass
'
t
governor
gave
a
speech
there
invoking
God
.
Please
,
spare
me
,
now
I
will
pass
.
Please
save
that
shit
for
church
.
The
rest
of
us
will
pass
on
this
crap.I
went
there
a
few
months
ago
for
Fish
Fry
after
reading
a
rating
that
this
place
was
a
great
place
for
Fish
Fry
's
.
I
've
had
dinner
here
before
and
it
was
very
good
,
so
I
thought
oh
why
not
,
I
'll
give
it
a
try
.
Big
mistake
!
They
usually
get
pretty
busy
-LRB-
usually
a
good
sign
-RRB-
,
but
that
night
we
did
n't
have
to
wait
long
for
a
table
.
I
ordered
the
Icelandic
Cod
and
It
was
terrible
.
As
this
was
a
few
months
ago
,
my
brain
is
clouded
on
which
exact
fish
-LRB-
cod
or
perch
-RRB-
the
comments
were
made
about
,
but
as
I
recall
:
The
waitress
claimed
that
the
cod
is
n't
``
fresh
''
and
she
knew
I
did
n't
like
it
,
so
she
offered
to
get
me
some
perch
,
which
was
fresh
.
That
was
n't
much
better
.
One
-LRB-
either
the
cod
or
the
perch
-RRB-
of
them
tasted
,
looked
like
and
smelled
like
a
``
fish
stick
.
''
It
literally
looked
like
a
kiddie
meal
.
All
in
all
,
I
will
never
return
for
a
fish
fry
there
.
The
waitress
was
very
attentive
and
tried
to
make
me
happy
,
but
it
was
not
her
fault
,
she
did
everything
she
could
to
please
me
.

Saturday
after
the

rally
,
many
of
us
were
warming
up
at
the
bar
,
having
a
drink
or
wine
and
some
food
and
swapping
``
war

''
and
photos
from
our
day
on
the

protesting
against
the

was

rear
end.TERRIBLE
service
,
went
here
for
breakfast
and
was
in
shock
and
awe
at
how
bad
our
server
was
.
It
took
well
over
45
minutes
for
us
to
get
our
food
and
there
was
only
1
other
table
in
the
restaurant
.
I
got
our
own
coffee
,
drinks
,
half
and
half
,
ketchup
and
jam
.
I
will
NEVER
go
back
there
again!The
place
sucks
.
I
do
n't
care
if
a
commie
or
socialist
or
nazi
eats
there
.
The
owners
are
what
concerns
me
most
.
I
enjoyed
the
food
the
first
time
but
when
I
ready
they
had
the
ass
'
t
governor
holding
some
fricking
prayer
service
there
I
was
through
.
I
do
n't
care
what
any

are
BUTT
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
or
read
about
them.It

food
,
this
is
the
place
.
The
upper

The
only
thing
I
can
chalk

up

is
they

not

that
far
to

I
just
had
it
on
a
bad
day.They
make
a
good

old

,
but
otherwise
I
am
not

Like
a
previous
reviewer
,
I
am
also
grossed
out
by
tartar
sauce
that
has
been
sitting
out
for
who-knows-how-long
.
And
the
fish
fry
?
I
really
do
n't
see
any
greatness
there
.
Cave-ish

my
scene.If
you
're
looking
for
a
fish
fry
and
are
in
madison
,
look
no
further
than
esquire
.
The
coleslaw
is
the
best
in
town
.
If
you
're
looking
to
eat
a
lot
,
order
the
ocean
perch
.
If
you
're
trying
to
eat
a
light
fish
fry
the
lake
perch
is
spectacular
.
Beer
prices
are
good
and
it
's
got
a
great
homey
atmosphereI
'll
start
by
saying
I
sat
at
the
bar
with
a
bunch
of
buddies
for
a
game
rather
than
actually
sitting
in
the
dining
room
so
the
comments
about
poor
service
may
be
legit
.
However
,
if
you
're
looking
to
judge
just
the
burgers
and
steaks
they
were
great
.
Solid
atmosphere
with
three
big
screens
around
a
bar
,
the
place
is
admittedly
for
an
older
crowd
but
they
were
very
accomadating
when
six
24
year
olds
strolled
in
for
a
game.Not
a
fan
.
We
had
a
breakfast
buffet
for
a
meeting
there
and
the
food
was
...
not
much
of
a
buffet
.
Potatoes
were
cold
and
greasy
and
the
rest
of
the
food
was
just
not
very
good
.
Have
not
had
lunch
or
dinner
here.My
wife
and
ate
there
tonight
.
Food
so
so
.
Service
not
good
.
Efficent
but
not
friendly
.
I
had
the
feeling
she
wanted
to
be
somewhere
elseAnother
chain
establishment
.
The
sad
thing
is
that
we
``
tried
''
to
go
to
Red
Lobster
first
,
but
were
repelled
by
the
large
crowd
of
waiting
people
.
No
,
I
do
n't
want
to
stand
around
like
cattle
waiting
for
my
pager
to
buzz
so
I
can
be
ushered
to
a
cramped
seat
,
fed
,
branded
,
and
ushered
out
again
stampede
style
.
The
mighty
gods
of
chain
restaurants
everywhere
are
wagging
their
fingers
at
me
right
now
saying
,
``
what
do
you
expect
lady
?
''
I
know
,
I
know
.
So
we
went
to
Olive
Garden
down
the
street
.
No
wait
there
.
Our
waitress
was
very
young
,
I
'll
refer
to
her
as
``
Sparky
''
.
My
dining
companion
had
a
sudden
need
to
try
some
wine
,
so
he
asked
Sparky
what
would
pair
well
with
the
lasagna
.
She
did
n't
come
across
confident
as
she
pointed
to
the
list
of
wines
on
the
menu
that
mister
dining
companion
was
holding
.
She
finally
chose
one
and
said
that
it
would
go
well
with
the
``
meaty
''
dish
.
I
'm
not
sure
what
either
one
of
us
was
expecting
because
after
all
this
is
Olive
Garden
and
we
have
almost
zero
knowledge
of
wines
.
So
de-classA
!!
After
Sparky
left
our
table
,
dining
companion
says
that
he
expects
the
chosen
wine
to
be
the
suck
because
Sparky
does
n't
look
like
she
's
even
old
enough
to
drink
,
let
alone
have
knowledge
of
the
fine
wines
.
But
you
know
,
none
of
this
really
matters
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
compared
to
her
we
are
old
as
dirt
,
and
still
do
n't
know
shit
about
wine
.
I
had
the
eggplant
Parmesan
with
Alfredo
sauce
.
It
usually
comes
with
marinara
,
but
if
I
'm
going
to
have
a
heart
attack
it
had
better
well
be
because
of
something
I
enjoyed
eating
,
not
something
I
felt
like
I
had
to
eat
in
the
name
of
my
health
!
Hell
no
!
Dining
companion
had
his
red
wine
something
or
other
,
and
he
was
right
it
sucked
.
He
described
it
as
tasting
like
,
``
the
barrel
it
came
out
of
''
.
After
the
main
course
I
had
the
seasonal
pumpkin
cheesecake
.
I
made
sure
to
look
in
a
direction
where
no
one
could
see
my
face
before
I
crossed
my
eyes
from
sheer
delight
.
I
am
a
pumpkin
lovin
'
nerd
by
nature
,
and
this
cheesecake
was
gooood
.
So
this
chain
experience
was
n't
too
bad
.
The
only
thing
that
sucked
was
no
refill
on
the
bread
sticks
.
If
I
'm
going
to
go
slummin
'
at
the
chain
restaurants
,
I
expect
the
constant
refills
man
.
Especially
on
those
items
they
advertise
as
``
bottomless
''
and/or
``
never-ending
''
.
Finally
,
Sparky
took
a
long
time
to
bring
by
the
check
,
and
this
goes
against
the
code
of
chain
fine
dining
,
wham
,
bam
,
thank
you
mam
.
Touche!Now
yes
I
know
it
is
yet
another
Olive
Garden
but
I
really
felt
it
necessary
to
comment
on
this
location
.
I
frequent
this
location
when
going
to
my
families
lake
house
in
Portage
.
I
must
say
this
location
really
stands
alone
.
The
staff
is
outstanding
and
the
service
and
food
is
always
top
notch
.
If
it
was
closer
to
Chicago
this
staff
could
easily
go
and
work
at
any
of
the
top
restaurants
here
in
Chicago.This
is
a
reliable
consistent
place
to
eat
.

this
was

YUMMY
!
The
wife
ordered
the
chicken
dumpling
soup
.
I
ordered
a
salad
.
chicken
dumpling
soup
is
a
traditional

and
excels

was

The
dumplings
were
doughy

I
ordered

-RRB-
.
But
the
overall
high
rating
for
this
place
was
more
of
our
waiter
Craig
D.
Can
I
tell
you
,
we
've
NEVER
had
a
wait
staff
being
so
attentive
for
our
party
of
5
.
He
knew
who
got
what
,
the
timing
of
our
drinks/salad/soups
/
main
meals
were
on
spot
,
like
clockwork
.
He
made
sure
our
drinks/water
was
full
,
the
bread
was
fresh
and
warm
,
salad
and
soup
refills
even
without
us
asking
for
more
.
He
made
us
feel
like
we
were
in
a
5
star
restaurant
,
really
.
What
great
service
,
next
time
when
we
're
back
in
town
we
'd
go
back
again!Yes
,
it
's
a
chain
.
Is
it
top
of
the
line
?
No
.
But
the
quality
has
greatly
improved
over
the
years
and
the
service
as
well
.
They
handle
groups
well
.
This
place
is
always
on
the
list
for
my
office
to
have
lunch
.
I
recommend
it.One
of
the
employees
stole
my
sons
wallet
.
He
left
it
at
the
table
and
with
in
a
half
hour
is
disappeared
.
The
management
are
not
willing
to
do
anything
about
this
and
say
that
it
just
disappeared
and
that
their
employees
do
not
steal
.
I
have
managed
restaurants
,
and
theft
is
quite
common
.
Ever
watch
restaurant
undercover
on
Foodnetwork
.
The
management
actually
laughed
at
me
that
i
would
think
the
employees
would
steal.It
's
been
over
a
month
&
I
can
not
remember
the
servers
name
unfortunately
.
We
arrived
late
on
a
Sunday
evening
on
our
way
home
from
Minneapolis
.
After
checking
into
our
hotel
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
the
restaurant
was
still
seating
.
We
walked
in
and
while
there
was
no
hostess
a
really
great
brunette
server
welcomed
us
and
sat
us
in
her
section
that
was
immediately
left
of
the
bar
area
&
first
booth
on
the
left
.
We
ordered
the
salad
which
is
pretty
much
a
given
drenched
with
dressing
.
We
asked
if
we
could
just
get
a
piece
of
grilled
chicken
and
al
dente
veggies
our
waitress
said
she
would
check
.
We
never
ask
for
special
orders
unless
its
clear
that
similar
options
are
on
the
menu
.
She
brought
out
a
chef
to
hear
what
we
wanted
.
We
were
blown
away
.
She
cared
so
much
about
getting
the
order
right
she
got
a
chef
out
there
.
To
his
credit
he
rocked
it
.
YUM
!
Grilled
chicken
&
lightly
cooked
veggies
were
perfect
.
We
asked
our
waitress
to
please
let
him
know
how
much
we
appreciated
his
efforts
&
how
good
they
were.Olive
Garden
is
Olive
Garden
.
What
can
you
say
?
On
this
visit
,
I
was
with
a
group
of
8
people
.
It
was
insanity
.
They
sat
us
at
two
tables
which
made
a
weird
shape
.
A
circle
and
a
square
?
The
ability
to
converse
was
difficult
.
Our
server
was
so
overwhelmed
.
He
should
have
had
some
help
.
Then
again
,
obviously
,
it
is
Olive
Garden
.
Same
as
usual.Similar
to
the
Middleton
one
,
but
this
one
is
a
bit
better
and
has
better
decor
.
Good
for
take
out.Grade
:
C
-
I
really
hope
that
was
chicken
in
my
Chicken
Lo-Mein
.
What
happened
to
this
place
?
What
a
dump
.
Good
service
but
I
kept
wondering
how
old
the
huge
mold
stain
on
the
ceiling
was.Had
lunch
here
today
.
All
in
all
,
the
food
is
tasty
and
I
've
been
her
several
times
before
.
Unfortunately
,
my
co-worker
got
a
hair
in
her
food
and
had
to
wait
for
them
to
re-cook
it
,
but
that
was
a
huge
dent
in
the
dining
experience.Been
going
here
for
years
but
either
the
quality
has
slid
or
my
taste
has
improved
because
the
last
few
times
have
been
a
disappointment
.
I
really
wan
na
like
it
as
I
live
nearby
but
anymore
I
drive
to
the
west
side
location
which
is
not
perfect
but
it
has
higher
quality
food
.
Why
ca
n't
this
town
have
one
good
Chinese
place
,
I
'd
eat
there
once
a
week
!
instead
we
have
50
awful
ones
and
three
mediocre
.
This
is
one
of
the
Mediocre
,
but
for
the
price
it
should
be
considerably
better
.
maybe
this
is
what
midwestern
mall
shoppers
want?The
food
is
still
tasty
but
business
seems
slower
lately
than
prior
years
.
Still
retains
a
great
interior
.
I
've
never
really
checked
out
the
bar.The
food
is
fresh
and
good
.
we
have
ordered
hot
and
sour
chicken
and
sesame
chicken
.
Looks
like
both
of
them
are
cooked
fresh
.
The
soup
is
mediocre
.
The
service
is
really
good.This
is
the
worst
Chinese
food
I
have
had
could
not
even
finish
meal
...
ordered
general
tso
's
chicken
with
egg
roll
.
I
do
not
recommend
this
place.Nice
decorations
and
inerior
,
that
's
about
it
.
The
waitress
is
not
helping
at
all
for
selecting
good
menu
.
They
are
charging
for
hot
tea
and
pepper
oil
.
-LRB-
I
guess
they
need
to
do
that
recover
from
investing
for
the
interior
.
-RRB-
Go
ahead
cross
the
street
and
go
to
the
food
court
in
the
mall
.
They
have
better
service
and
half
lower
price
for
the
better
food.After
reading
all
the
reviews
i
was
really
hesitant
on
going
to
this
restaurant
.
My
boyfriend
and
I
decided
to
stop
by
since
we
were
craving
Chinese
and
decided
to
sit
in
the
bar
.
Obviously
everyone
has
a
different
opinion
but
this
place
was
amazing
!
First
off
,
the
hostess
was
adorable
and
incredibly
sweet
.
The
bartender
was
amazing
and
he
made
us
feel
right
at
home
.
And
the
owner
of
the
restaurant
seemed
like
the
sweetest
lady
in
the
world
.
The
decor
was
what
I
would
expect
from
a
Chinese
restaurant
but
they
made
the
restaurant
feel
classy
and
not
cheap
.
I
ordered
the
pepper
steak
no
tomatoes
and
my
boyfriend
got
pork
egg
foo
young
.
Wow
is
all
I
can
say
.
The
beef
actually
tasted
like
real
fresh
meat
!
Not
the
rubber
fake
kind
you
get
at
other
cheap
takeouts
.
The
only
draw
back
i
had
was
that
the
peppers
and
onions
were
cut
pretty
big
but
that
was
n't
a
huge
issue
.
My
boyfriends
egg
foo
young
was
like
none
other
and
they
sure
did
n't
hold
back
on
the
sauce
!
The
pork
inside
was
actually
Chinese
bbq
pork
and
it
sure
added
a
kick
.
Overall
,
the
prices
are
a
tad
bit
high
but
worth
every
penny
!
All
the
workers
and
the
owner
are
so
helpful
and
you
can
tell
they
really
appreciate
their
customers
.
This
is
definitely
my
#
1
stop
for
Chinese
on
the
east
side!Overall
experience
was
disappointing
.
For
all
of
the
awards
that
they
've
received
that
they
display
in
the
entrance
,
this
experience
was
not
good
.
Food
was
okay
,
probably
one
of
the
most
bland
general
tsao
's
chicken
I
have
ever
had
.
And
last
but
not
least
,
the
service
was
terrible
.
I
had
to
wait
20
minutes
for
my
second
glass
of
water
.
If
you
are
looking
for
a
good
Chinese
restaurant
,
your
best
bet
is
to
save
a
few
dollars
and
get
a
better
meal
at
Panda
Express
at
the
east
town
mall
across
the
street.I
do
n't
know
what
all
the
bad
reviews
are
about
.
I
eat
lunch
here
once
a
week
or
so
and
like
the
food
and
service
.
Not
bad
at
all!Lame
,
I
didnt
have
very
high
expectations
but
had
heard
a
very
good
things
and
I
was
not
impressed
.
The
bartender
told
me
everything
was
fresh
and
prepared
in
house
and
made
to
order
.
After
I
ordered
the
food
came
out
literally
within
1-3
mins
so
I
know
for
a
fact
that
it
was
not
fresh
or
made
to
order
.
To
be
honest
I
would
have
been
more
satisfied
with
food
court
chinese/asian
food
.
Sad
comparison
i
know
,
but
true
.
I
would
not
eat
there
again.Hands
down
my
favorite
place
for
Chinese
food
in
Madison
.
Consistency
is
key
for
me
and
IG
is
always
consistent
.
The
pace
is
slower
than
some
restaurants
,
but
it
's
worth
the
extra
time
.
We
eat
here
at
least
4-5
times
a
year
and
it
's
always
a
great
night
with
great
service
.
Cashew
Chicken
,
egg
roll
,
shrimp
rangoon
and
a
glass
of
wine
=
LOVE!It
was
not
bad
but
the
wonton
soup
was
bland
and
the
chicken
and
broccoli
had
almost
not
flavor
.
Tasted
like
the
chicken
was
boiled
.
The
beef
and
pea
pods
were
good
.
Reasonable
dinner
size
plateImperial
Garden
Chinese
Restaurant
was
recommended
to
us
when
we
moved
to
the
Madison
area
.
I
was
in
the
area
for
a
business
lunch
and
we
decided
to
try
it
out
.
The
atmosphere
was
great
for
a
business
lunch
.
The
highback
booths
allow
for
private
conversations
.
They
would
also
make
great
date
booths
as
well
.
The
atmosphere
was
quiet
and
allowed
for
conversation
.
The
first
thing
I
noticed
was
the
local
art
and
crafts
that
were
for
sale
in
the
restaurant
.
There
were
handmade
bags
and
paintings
.
Both
were
great
products
.
I
am
looking
forward
to
bringing
my
husband
back
to
Imperial
Garden
to
show
him
the
art
.
The
decor
was
welcoming
and
not
overly
kitschy
-
no
gold
waving
kitty
...
so
to
all
who
love
those
.
The
decor
was
a
step
above
.
I
ordered
the
General
Tso
's
chicken
-LRB-
standard
I
know
-RRB-
.
It
was
ok
.
A
little
bland
,
but
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
spicy
food
then
it
would
be
for
you
.
If
I
ordered
it
again
I
would
ask
for
them
to
kick
up
the
spice
.
My
colleague
found
the
heat
level
just
right
.
There
was
no
wait
for
lunch
during
the
week
,
The
manager
stopped
over
twice
to
check
on
our
meal
.
Overall
,
a
great
experience
and
we
will
be
back!Good
food
,
good
service
and
clean
.
I
had
the
cashew
chicken
,
my
wife
had
the
general
tsao
's
chicken
and
my
son
had
chicken
fried
rice
.
All
were
very
good
.
My
only
complaint
,
and
it
is
very
minor
,
is
that
the
chairs
have
wheels
.
It
is
very
easy
to
scoot
yourself
around
unexpectedly
.
I
will
definitely
return
the
next
time
I
am
in
Madison.I
really
do
n't
know
what
happened
with
all
of
the
negative
reviewers
.
We
've
been
coming
to
Imperial
Garden
since
1997
.
We
've
tried
other
places
,
but
this
place
is
easily
the
best
for
Chinese
food
anywhere
in
the
area
.
Chicken
&
Broccoli
,
Beef
Lo-mein
,
Stir
fried
rice
noodles
,
steamed
pot
stickers
,
&
the
chicken
egg
foo
young
are
all
great
!
General
Tso
's
is
good
too
.
Staff
is
very
friendly
,
many
have
been
working
there
for
10
+
years
,
and
we
are
remembered
when
we
come
in
-
a
nice
touch
.
We
've
been
to
the
westside
location
as
well
.
Good
,
but
not
as
good
as
East
,
if
you
ask
me
.
If
you
do
n't
believe
me
,
take
a
look
at
the
wall
in
the
lobby
.
They
've
won
best
in
Madison
nearly
every
year
since
1987
!
How
many
restaurants
around
now
can
say
the
same
thing
??
My
husband
and
I
returned
to
Imperial
Garden
for
dinner
with
our
children
.
We
were
there
on
a
Friday
night
.
There
was
a
bit
of
a
wait
-LRB-
about
20
min
-RRB-
,
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
a
Friday
night
around
5:30
pm
.
We
had
another
great
experience
.
We
found
IG
family
friendly
and
able
to
accommodate
our
two
children
without
disturbing
any
other
guests
.
Our
five
year
old
loved
the
experience
and
the
food
as
well
.
And
as
parents
know
,
if
your
children
are
happy
,
you
are
happy
.
We
ordered
the
-LRB-
very
affordable
I
might
add
-RRB-
lo
mein
for
our
daughter
.
It
was
good
and
there
were
plenty
of
leftovers
between
the
lo
mein
and
the
two
entrees
we
ordered.Try
the
shrimp
egg
foo
young
.
It
is
the
best
ever
.
The
shrimp
fried
rice
is
great
,
good
with
vegetables
.
Do
n't
forget
the
bar
.
A
lot
of
people
like
to
stop
in
.
The
bartender
is
friendly
,
just
like
the
show
Cheers
.
You
can
order
and
eat
at
the
bar
if
you
want
.
The
manager
Rose
is
elegant
and
full
of
laughter
.
No
worries
at
this
place.Two
fav
dishes
are
the
chicken
sizzling
rice
soup
and
the
princess
beef
-LRB-
which
they
do
n't
have
on
the
menu
anymore
;
closest
dish
is
the
oyster
beef
-RRB-
.
Also
love
ordering
the
tropical
fruit
punch
.
Has
a
nice
atmosphere
.
Wish
it
was
n't
so
pricy
but
the
food
is
great
.
Would
continue
to
go
back
for
some
soup
and
maybe
try
the
Peking
duck
sometime.Good
service
.
Not
that
high
on
the
food.We
really
enjoyed
our
meal
there
.
We
ordered
a
variety
of
dishes
including
curry
beef
,
egg
foo
young
and
Governor
's
chicken
.
Nothing
trendy
,
just
reliable
Chinese
dishes
.
Everything
was
fresh
,
and
the
beef
egg
foo
young
was
especially
good
.
We
'd
return.Best
Chinese
food
in
Midwest
.
I
'm
from
the
San
Francisco
Bay
Area
,
and
the
quality
here
matches
any
Chinese
restaurant
back
home!This
place
is
mediocre
at
best
.
My
husband
and
I
ordered
for
carry
out
.
We
ordered
the
crab
rangoons
as
an
appetizer
,
however
,
I
think
they
forgot
to
add
the
crab
to
the
filling
.
The
were
stuffed
with
chunks
of
cream
cheese
--
very
boring
and
lacking
in
flavor
.
My
husband
ordered
the
General
Tso
's
Chicken
and
I
ordered
Cashew
Shrimp
,
neither
of
which
were
remarkable
.
We
are
going
to
keep
trying
to
find
a
decent
Chinese
restaurant
in
the
Madison
area
,
that
's
for
sure.This
place
gets
top
marks
from
me
.
The
food
was
delicious
and
prices
are
very
favorable
.
The
service
was
very
polite
and
prompt
.
I
asked
to
add
tofu
-LRB-
NOT
fried
-RRB-
to
my
eggplant/Thai
basil
dish
.
Normally
I
get
arguments
about
not
frying
my
tofu
-LRB-
I
really
,
really
do
n't
care
for
fried
-RRB-
,
but
not
here
.
The
chef
expertly
prepared
my
meal
.
The
seasoning
and
sauce
was
really
nice
.
The
sauce
was
just
the
right
amount
.
If
I
had
to
say
one
thing
...
the
rice
was
a
little
sticky
,
but
I
can
totally
see
past
that
because
the
overall
meal
was
just
great
.
I
enjoyed
the
left
overs
the
next
day.Very
good
lunch
.
$
30.00
for
three
of
us
.
Steamed
dumplings
for
appetizer
.
2
shrimp
lo-mien
and
1
cashew
chicken
with
egg
rolls
.
Almost
an
entire
plate
of
shrimp
and
noodles
to
take
home
.
Snack
of
cashew
chicken
taken
home
also
.
Great
service
and
very
good
food
.
We
'll
be
back
when
we
come
again
to
Madison.Not
sure
why
this
place
has
so
many
good
reviews
as
the
food
is
not
Chinese
!
I
'm
a
Chinese
girl
myself
and
I
know
how
Chinese
food
should
taste
like
.
And
this
place
does
not
have
the
authentic
Chinese
taste
,
in
fact
,
it
is
a
mixture
of
American
,
Thai
and
Chinese
altogether
which
makes
me
disappointed
.
However
,
what
makes
me
even
more
disappointed
was
when
I
ordered
beef
lo
mein
,
The
waiter
was
too
busy
chitchatting
with
guests
and
put
in
pork
lo
mein
instead
.
When
I
called
him
back
-LRB-
it
was
a
takeout
order
-RRB-
he
was
saying
it
was
his
mistake
and
will
credit
that
for
my
future
order
and
refused
to
replace
it
!
I
was
like
,
really
?
Definitely
will
not
come
back
and
not
recommend
this
place
to
friends
and
family!Ordered
food
for
delivery
at
a
local
hotel
after
8
hours
on
the
road
.
Gave
all
details
of
where
we
were
staying
and
after
an
hour
and
15
minutes
got
a
call
asking
why
we
had
not
picked
up
our
food
.
Were
told
there
was
no
indication
on
the
order
that
it
was
delivery
!
Terrible
miscommunication
at
their
end
!
When
food
arrived
it
was
cold
and
not
one
fork
or
napkin
in
the
bag
.
Very
frustrating
for
hungry
weary
travelers
...
be
careful
if
you
are
ordering
delivery
from
this
place!This
bar
had
become
something
of
a
second
home
to
me
on
Monday
nights
for
the
2.5
years
we
lived
in
Madison
.
During
most
of
the
week
it
's
a
nice
blue
collar
hangout
,
but
on
Monday
's
it
keeps
the
blue
collar
drink
pricing
,
but
adds
some
of
the
best
live
funk
and
soul
music
to
be
found
in
the
midwest
.
Also
check
out
Wednesday
nights
for
the
open
jam
session
they
have
weekly
.
Best
beer
on

Moose
Drool
hands
down.Unpretentious
Wisconsin-y
hangout
with
good
live
music.Welcome
to
my
exclusive
1-star
club
,
Mr.
Roberts
.
I
went
here
to
see
a
friend
's
band
play
,
despite
my
boyfriend
's
warning
that
it
was
not
the
greatest
bar
.
I
do
so
love
dive
bars
--
how
bad
could
it
be
?
Bad
.
It
's
so
bad
.
It
's
past
the
stage
of
being
a
fun
dive
bar
,
it
's
just
plain
frightening
.
The
people
looked
like
the
kind
of
scary
,
angry
drunks
you
would
only
encounter
in
a
movie
.
The
bathroom
stall
was
so
little
that
had
I
weighed
20
pounds
more
,
I
probably
would
have
gotten
wedged
in
-LRB-
the
door
opened
inward
,
not
outward
-RRB-
.
We
did
not
stay
long
,
I
did
not
regret
it
,
and
wo
n't
be
back
.
Ick
,
yuck
,
blech
,
and
ptooey
.
Why
would
anyone
think
this
is
a
good
place
?!
I
fully
appreciate
that
Mr.
Roberts
is
a
blue
collar
dive
bar
that
's
located
on
Atwood
.
So
when
a
friend
asked
me
to
join
him
to
watch
a
favorite
band
there
,
I
set
my
expectations
accordingly
.
Is
it
possible
for
an
establishment
to
disappoint
you
when
you
've
already
lowered
your
expectations
to
crackhouse-lows
?
Only
if
that
establishment
is
Mr.
Roberts
.
The
tap
beers
are
not
only
unexciting
,
they
're
as
stale
and
flat
as
day
old
bread
that
's
been
run
over
by
a
steamroller
.
Bartenders
are
more
interested
in
talking
with
their
buddies
than
they
are
helping
anyone
.
And
the
whole
vibe
of
this
place
is
more
sketchy
than
an
Etch-A-Sketch
wearing
Sketchers
...
I
'd
give
anything
to
not
be
stuck
here
right
now
.
I
'm
scared
to
death
of
what
might
be
lurking
in
the
bathrooms
...
Think
I
'll
go
pee
in
the
parking
lot.Mr
.
Roberts
is
not
a
place
I
'd
ever
go
to
for
the
sole
purpose
of
going
out
.
Both
times
I
've
gone
have
been
for
bands
,
and
both
times
were
fairly
different
experiences
.
My
first
time
was
a
one-star
experience
:
it
was
ridiculously
hot
and
humid
inside
,
the
staff
lacked
any
sort
of
motivation
for
good
customer
service
,
and
they
crammed
the
7
-
or
8-piece
band
in
the
front
of
the
bar
near
the
window
,
making
for
awkward
viewing
and
playing
.
The
sound
was
terrible
and
I
spent
more
time
outside
than
in
.
My
second
time
was
a
better
experience
,
but
still
not
one
that
would
cause
me
to
suggest
other
people
go
there
.
This
time
around
it
was
a
reasonable
temperature
in
the
bar
,
but
that
may
only
be
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
in
the
50s
outside
.
The
bands
played
in
the
back
of
the
bar
in
an
alcove/side
room
deal
and
it
made
a
lot
more
sense
.
The
sound
was
still
deafening
and
subject
to
random
strangers
twiddling
the
knobs
on
the
mixer
,
but
overall
not
too
bad
.
Free
music
is
the
best
thing
-LRB-
only
thing
?
-RRB-
Mr.
Roberts
has
going
for
it
.
Its
biggest
downsides
:
-
it
's
touted
as
a
blue-collar
bar
,
but
it
's
more
an
excuse
to
be
shabby
and
dirty
than
anything
;
$
15
for
a
5-bottle
bucket
of
beer
is
not
a
good
deal
,
and
$
5
for
a
PBR
&
a
rail
shot
is
a
special
for
a
couple
hours
one
night
a
week
when
it
should
be
the
standard
price
for
such
a
combination
-
the
ladies
room
is
ridiculously
tiny
and
awkward
,
had
a
seat
that
was
half
hanging
off
the
bowl
,
and
no
TP
-
every
surface
was
dirty
or
sticky
,
yuck
You
probably
wo
n't
die
if
you
go
to
see
a
friend
's
band
play
,
but
supporting
a
friend
should
be
the
only
motivation
for
setting
foot
inside.Come
on
people
,
it
's
Mr.
Roberts
.
It
's
a
dive
bar
,
it
's
stinky
,
dingy
,
sometimes
scary
and
that
's
the
way
it
's
supposed
to
be
,
to
keep
the
squeamish
out
.
Quit
being
haters
,
there
are
plenty
of
white-washed
established
to
frequent
for
the
faint
of
heart
.
As
for
the
crap
tap
beer-order
a
bottle
.
I
for
one
am
thankful
that
shit-holes
like
this
exist.It
's
not
that
bad
of
a
place
if
you
go
in
at
the
right
time
-LRB-
8
PM
-RRB-
.
But
be
careful
you
will
get
hit
with
a
Sublime
cover
band
.
Food
is
regular
bar
food
and
nothing
special
.
Drinks
are
cheap
and
the
bar
is
long
there
are
plenty
of
places
to
sit
.
There
is
a
pool
table
and
video
poker
-LRB-
All
Fruit
Bonus
-RRB-
.
Very
Sconnie
however
a
little
seedy
for
the
faint
of
heart.Haha
-
this
place
is
tawesome
.
A
group
of
my
friends
caught
a
comedian
at
the
Barrymore
Theatre
and
had
some
time
to
kill
beforehand
.
We
wanted
to
find
a
place
to
eat
nearby
but
everywhere
had
a
15
minute
wait
-
and
we
did
n't
have
that
kind
of
time
before
the
show
.
We
setled
for
Mr.
Roberts
Bar
and
Grill
,
and
what
a
hoot
it
was
!!
First
off
,
their
food
was
okay
.
Nothing
to
rave
or
complain
about
.
The
menu
is
limited
though
-
it
definitely
is
n't
really
a
place
to
go
to
eat
.
They
did
n't
have
any
drink
specials
,
which
made
me
sad
:-LRB-
I
'm
used
to
just
getting
whatever
beer
is
on
sale
,
because
I
like
everything
,
but
no
such
luck
.
However
,
they
are
n't
expensive
so
I
paid
about
4
dollars
for
a
beer
I
think
.
The
best
part
of
this
place
is
that
it
is
totally
divey
,
and
it
had
a
lot
of
interesting
characters
.
This
drunk
30
year
old
guy
played
pool
with
my
friend
and
had
a
lengthy
conversation
with
me
about
how
he
used
to
unpack
semi
trucks
or
something
.
.
I
do
n't
know
.
My
friends
would
say
the
best
part
about
this
place
is
their
mixed
drinks
-LRB-
a
gin
and
tonic
and
a
rum
and
coke
I
think
?
-RRB-
came
in
pint
sizes
-
haha
.
Biggest
mixed
drinks
they
'd
ever
seen
.
Ca
n't
vouch
for
how
strong
they
were
-
but
large
none
the
less
.
I
would
n't
say
this
place
is
a
destination
,
at
all
,
but
next
time
you
're
at
the
Barrymore
,
it
is
a
cool
place
to
check
out
next
door
for
a
drink.The
service
at
Mr.
Roberts
is
okay
,
but
the
free
live
music
is
what
pulls
me
in
!
Drinks
are
reasonably
priced
too.Another
east-side
dive
bar
...
not
great
,
but
not
bad
either.I
never
went
into
the
old
Tip
Top
-LRB-
because
I
was
far
too
terrified
-RRB-
but
there
is
no
way
it
held
a
candle
to
the
current
Tip
Top
.
Basically
,
the
place
looks
fantastic
from
ceiling
to
floor
.
It
now
makes
sense
why
the
remodel
took
so
long
and
it
was
clearly
worth
the
wait
.
It
's
exactly
what
you
'd
want
a
neighborhood
bar
to
be
.
Small
but
not
too
small
,
inviting
atmosphere
,
comfortable
lighting
,
and
no
over
the
top
decorating
.
I
had
a
beer
and
a
very
good
whisky
sour
.
Looking
forward
to
heading
back
soon.Dropped-by

It
's
a
bar

it
's
supposed
to
be
noisy

so
deal
with
it

man

Grabbed
a

table
near
the
back/side
wall
.
Ben
,
the
owner
,
introduced
himself
and
was
so
welcoming
,
gracious
,
and
sincere
.
He
's
done
an
amazing
job
with
this
place
and
I
'm
confident
it
's
going
to
be
a
smashing
success
.
I
love
that
it
's
just
a
few
blocks
from
my
house
,
because
I
know
I
'm
going
to
be
here
often
.
Ca
n't
wait
to
try
the
food
-
the
menu
sounds
and
looks
like
a
perfect
match
to
the
neighborhood
,
while
honoring
the
spirit
of
the
joint
.
Would
I
go
here
with
a
date
or
someone
that
I
wanted
to
have
a
good
,
solid
conversation
with
?
Probably
not
-
it
's
just
a
little
too
noisy
for
that
.
But
for
any
and
every
other
occasion
?
Absofreakinglutely
.
Very
,
very
cool
place.Man
,
Madison
is
getting
so
many
great
new
places
that
it
is
hard
for
me
to
keep
track
!
The
Tip
Top
Tavern
is
one
of
those
spots
I
always
drove
by
and
thought
``
Man
,
what
a
dive
.
I
bet
It
's
great
''
,
but
never
got
around
to
visiting
.
So
,
when
I
found
out
they
had
opened
back
up
with
a
new
owner
,
a
food
menu
,
and
a
new
look
I
decided
I
had
better
get
over
there
.
Seriously
,
folks
-
what
a
great
little
place
.
After
a
bit
of
a
rough
start
where-in
I
ordered
a
beer
that
I
could
n't
even
look
at
because
it
was
so
awful
-LRB-
the
Dogfish
Head
T'weason
Ale
-
what
a
disaster
of
a
beer
.
They
were
super
cool
and
replaced
it
with
their
house
old-fashioned
,
which
was
one
of
the
best
takes
on
the
cocktail
I
have
ever
had
-RRB-
the
meal
went
really
smooth
-
especially
considering
how
crazy
busy
it
was
.
Between
the
three
of
us
we
ordered
2
burgers
,
cheese
curds
,
and
the
fish
fry
special
.
The
burger
was
delicious
,
moist
,
and
cooked
extremely
well
.
The
coleslaw
was
tasty
,
but
had
way
too
much
vinegar
.
The
fries
were
crispy
and
free
of
excess
oil
which
was
nice
.
Apparently
the
fish
was
delicious
as
well
.
Finally
-
the
curds
.
Oh
man
,
the
curds
!
They
were
seriously
-LRB-
tip
-RRB-
top-notch
.
Lightly
breaded
,
crispy
,
and
gooey
with
some
nice
tasting
ranch
on
the
side
.
These
are
the
closest
to
perfection
I
have
ever
had
.
Hopefully
it
was
n't
a
fluke
!
Beyond
the
food
and
drink
,
it
really
was
a
nice
space
.
The
lighting
was
great
,
the
decorations
were
were
fun
,
and
it
just
felt
like
a
cozy
place
that
I
would
love
to
hang
out
at
on
a
Wednesday
night
to
grab
a
burger
and
a
beer
.
I
feel
like
all
I
have
done
lately
is
write
about
how
awesome
the
spots
I
go
to
are
,
but
hopefully
that
says
more
about
how
great
Madison
is
than
it
does
about
my
-LRB-
potentially
-RRB-
overly-optimistic
ratings.The
place
has
gotten
quite
a
dramatic
face-lift
.
It
looks
great
.
I
love
everything
they
've
done
with
the
place
.
I
tried
the
Tip
Top
Burger
and
the
chili
.
The
burger
was
fine
,
but
not
spectacular
.
The
chili
was
really
freaking
delicious
,
though
.
I
would
highly
recommend
grabbing
a
bowl
.
The
space
is
pretty
small
,
but
there
is
actually
a
lot
of
seating
.
It
does
get
pretty
loud
though
.
The
staff
members
were
all
very
nice
and
did
a
great
job
.
The
bitchy
people
next
to
us
were
treated
a
lot
nicer
than
they
deserved
.
A
waiter
mixed
up
an
order
and
was
very
apologetic
and
quickly
resolved
the
issue
.
Overall
,
I
'm
happy
that
the
place
is
finally
open
.
A
welcome
addition
to
the
neighborhood.I
love
that
the
best
of
this
classic
Wisconsin
tavern
was
preserved
whilst
providing
a
much-needed
facelift
.
It
's
a
great
addition
to
the
neighborhood
.
We
were
there
the
week
it
opened
and
I
enjoyed
a
few
creative
cocktails
.
My
husband
,
a
beer
aficionado
,
loved
the
beer
list
,
which
includes
2
nitro
taps
.
We
were
there
again
last
night
with
friends
for
the
fish
fry
.
When
I
read
the
menu
,
I
was
intrigued
by
the
Rooster
sandwich
,
which
is
essentially
a
BLT
+
fried
egg
.
I
'm
so
glad
I
tried
this
instead
of
the
fish
because
it
was
really
good
.
It
's
such
a
large
sandwich
,
though
,
it
is
probably
better
to
split
with
a
friend
.
I
ca
n't
believe
I
'm
going
to
write
this
,
but
there
may
have
been
TOO
much
bacon
-LRB-
although
I
managed
to
eat
the
entire
thing
-RRB-
!
If
you
love
bacon
,
this
is
the
sandwich
for
you
!
My
husband
had
the
fish
,
which
was
a
nice
piece
of
walleye
and
perfectly
fried
.
He
does
n't
normally
like
cole
slaw
but
specifically
noted
how
much
he
liked
the
slaw
.
He
also
liked
the
tartar
sauce
,
and
said
it
was
enhanced
with
dill
.
We
live
less
than
2
miles
from
Tip
Top
,
so
we
look
forward
to
spending
more
time
there
,
especially
when
we
can
bike
there
during
warmer
months!I
could
say
``
This
is
a
tip
top
spot
!
''
but
that
would
be
CHEESY
and
my
New
Year
's
resolution
23
years
ago
was
to
avoid
such
things
.
ANYways
.
I
definitely
liked
the
ambiance
of
this
space
a
lot
.
A
charming
neighborhood
bar
with
horizontal
narrow
wood
paneling
,
lower
lighting
,
tiled
floor
,
tin
ceiling
,
and
a
very
pretty
border/trim
around
the
ceiling
.
Being
a
small-ish
space
with
lower
ceilings
and
hard
floors
,
it
does
get
a
bit
noisy
when
the
place
fills
up
so
best
to
beat
the
rush
if
you
're
sensitive
to
that
sort
of
thing
.
Also
,
it
's
another
CASH
ONLY
spot
so
be
sure
to
stock
up
or
else
they
have
an
ATM
on
site
.
My
co-workers
and
I
headed
here
for
drinks
one
Friday
.
The
place
seemed
to
have
a
``
must
order
food
''
policy
in
order
to
be
seated
at
the
tables
so
15
of
us
frustratingly
spent
a
bit
of
time
crowded
at
the
entrance
,
downing
beers
,
trying
to
decide
if
we
should
move
on
.
Fortunately
,
I
think
the
staff
finally
figured
out
that
two
beers
basically
equals
the
cost
of
a
sandwich
-LRB-
so
what
's
the
difference
-RRB-
and
we
got
a
nice
row
of
tables
.
Whew
!
The
place
was
definitely
running
a
wait
by
6:30
pm
so
,
again
,
head
out
early/late
!
The
Mister
and
I
headed
here
at
6pm
on
a
Saturday
and
were
able
to
snag
the
last
open
table
in
the
place
.
The
beer
list
is
good
and
reasonably
priced
-LRB-
$
4
-RRB-
.
The
menu
offers
burgers
,
apps
,
and
sandwiches
and
sports
several
vegetarian
options
.
Mr.
had
the
special
-LRB-
Walleye
sandwich
-RRB-
which
he
enjoyed
while
I
had
the
Seitan
Philly
-LRB-
$
8.95
-RRB-
,
also
tasty
.
We
started
with
the
cheese
curds
-LRB-
$
5.95
-RRB-
which
were
yummy
.
I
'd
previously
had
the
kettle
chips/dip
,
which
were
just
that
,
chips/dip
,
nothing
fancy
and
the
fried
pickles
which
were
n't
my
favorite
...
All
in
all
I
really
liked
the
ambiance
-LRB-
but
I
'd
go
early
so
I
can
hear
better
-RRB-
and
appreciate
the
reasonably
priced
&
yummy
options
for
both
vegetarians
and
carnivores
.
I
hope
they
are
able
to
work
out
the
kinks
along
the
way
-LRB-
i.e.
,
must
order
food
to
get
a
seat
policy
-RRB-
but
overall
think
this
is
a
very
nice
addition
to
the
neighborhood.Small
but
high-quality
menu
selections
with
locally
sourced
foods
.
Good
value
for
what
you
get
.
Great
selection
of
microbrew
beers
.
Our
waiter
was
very
attentive
and
a
nice
guy
.
TheTip
Top
Tavern
has
opened
again
after
a
major
remodel
.
It
was
well
worth
the
wait
.
It
is
now
cozy
,
cute
,
and
tiny
.
Great
for
those
who
prefer
unique
destinations
over
corporate
chains.Went
here
for
the
first
time
last
night
.
Cozy
is
the
first
word
that
comes
to
mind
.
The
food
we
tried
was
a
mixed
bag
.
Sweet
potato
fries
were
waffle-style
,
and
not
very
sweet
potato-ey
.
The
fried
pickles
had
a
nice
spicy
kick
,
and
the
Green
Chili
Mac
&
Cheese
hit
the
spot
.
Savory
,
creamy
and
spicy
.
About
a
dozen
great
beers
on
tap
,
and
nicely-priced
and
delicious
cocktails
.
But
I
think
I
'd
still
rather
just
go
to
Mickey
's
!
I
love
the
Tip
Top
.
I
have
eaten
here
half
a
dozen
times
and
everything
has
been
delicious
and
reasonable
.
The
drinks
and
the
wine
selection
are
great
for
a
bar
of
it
's
size
and
the
owner
is
fantastic
!
I
especially
recommend
the
pastrami
reuben.Stopped
by
for
a
late
meal
on
a
Thursday
night
and
the
place
was
quite
lively
,
but
there
were
still
a
few
tables
open
.
The
servers
all
seemed
to
be
having
a
good
time
and
took
excellent
care
of
us
,
checking
in
just
enough
but
not
too
much
.
The
menu
is
small
,
but
has
something
for
everyone
.
We
tried
the
carnitas
-
flavorful
and
tender
-
and
a
burger
-
expertly
seasoned
and
juicy
.
Both
were
slightly
overcooked
:
the
burger
arrived
more
medium
rare
than
the
requested
rare
,
and
on
the
carnitas
the
yolk
of
one
fried
egg
was
deliciously
soft
,
while
the
other
was
just
a
bit
too
set
.
However
the
high
quality
ingredients
and
delightful
flavors
evened
out
any
imperfections
.
The
drink
menu
was
well
rounded
and
we
enjoyed
both
the
beer
and
cocktails
.
The
small
touches
in
design
elevate
the
interior
from
the
ordinary
in
an
entirely
pleasing
way
.
Tip
Top
is
a
great
addition
to
the
neighborhood
and
I
look
forward
to
enjoying
it
again
soon.I
never
set
foot
in
the
old
Tip
Top
so
could
n't
attest
to
the
transformation
which
I
hear
is
remarkable
.
What
I
can
say
is
this
is
my
favorite
all-around
bar
.
Justin
is
a
good
down
to
earth
guy
.
Even
when
it
's
busy
he
takes
time
to
talk
and
makes
custom
drinks
.
I
can
definitely
say
Tip
Top
has
the
best
mixed
drinks
in
town
.
Add
the
tasteful
decor
and
the
decent
pub
food
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
neighborhood/dive
bars
in
Madison.I
came
in
yesterday
with
a
pretty
big
group
of
ten
plus
we
sat
on
the
patio
which
was
very
nice
.
The
waitress
was
very
polite
and
was
checking
on
us
pretty
consistently
:-RRB-
.
This
was
the
first
time
I
had
been
there
since
it
was
redone
and
I
really
liked
how
it
looked
.
My
friend
and
I
tried
the
Chipotle
Chicken
and
Wild
Rice
soup
it
was
so
delicious
even
on
that
very
hot
day
so
kudos
to
that
!
I
also
tried
one
of
the
fried
pickles
with
the
sauce
it
came
with
it
was
also
very
good
!
Had
a
good
time
here.Love
!
We
will
be
back
,
and
back
often
.
As
our
summer
Saturday
dining
trek
continues
this
is
the
epitome
of
what
we
want
.
A
local
joint
,
that
just
makes
you
comfortable
and
glad
to
be
out
.
Arrived
about
6:30
on
a
Saturday
,
and
found
our
way
to
the
new
back
patio
.
A
couple
of
larger
groups
,
but
plenty
of
choice
of
seating
.
Found
our
table
,
and
service
was
immediate-friendly
,
attentive
,
and
just
exceptional
.
KR
had
barely
ordered
and
could
n't
stop
gushing
about
her
love
of
this
place
.
We
started
with
the
fried
pickles
,
based
on
previous
reviews
,
and
they
were
perfectly
done
.
KR
had
the
Rooster
sandwich
and
enjoyed
it
so
much
,
she
only
offered
me
a
tiny
bite
,
As
I
'm
unable
to
order
the
same
,
I
was
forced
to
the
Tip
Top
burger
,
and
was
not
disappointed
.
Perfectly
done
,
and
flavor
throughout
.
After
another
beverage
,
and
just
enjoying
the
evening
,
we
got
our
check
and
headed
out
.
Thanks
to
other
reviews
,
we
knew
CASH
only
,
but
there
is
an
ATm
,
so
heads
up
!
Perfect
,
exactly
what
we
wanted
,
and
this
sets
the
bar
for
us
for
the
balance
of
our
summer
Saturday
dining
trek.We
've
been
coming
here
since
January
2014
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.
I
usually
order
the
catfish
po
'
boy
,
but
alas
it
has
been
taken
off
the
menu
.
No
worries
,
it
turns
out
that
a
new
addition
,
the
Tuna
So
Gouda
,
is
also
a
winner
.
Not
too
mayonnaise-y
,
the
flavors
are
capers
,
dijon
mustard
and
basil
.
Served
on
rye
,
it
's
a
big
win
.
The
beer
list
is
n't
huge
but
it
's
got
all
the
best
of
the
bunch
and
changes
often
.
The
noise
level
can
be
challenging
,
given
the
small
size
of
the
place
and
the
fact
that
it
's
usually
packed
.
Love
the
interior
,
very
art
deco-ish
in
blues
,
greens
and
golds
,
warm
and
inviting
.
The
service
is
friendly
,
attentive
and
prompt
.
The
fried
pickles
are
a
must-have
appetizer
,
they
're
slices
rather
than
spears
,
and
the
batter
is
a
light
tempura
style
.
They
're
served
with
the
Tip
Top
sauce
,
a
spicy
sriracha
aeoli
.
Delish
.
Had
me
wishing
for
another
round
:--RRB-
They
were
surprisingly
not
busy
last
night
probably
due
to
the
extensive
road
work
currently
happening
right
in
front
and
all
around
the
building
.
Now
would
be
a
great
time
to
check
them
out
if
you
have
n't
,
it
will
be
quieter
and
no
waiting.Time
for
an
update
,
as
it
's
been
6
months
since
my
initial
review
,
and
I
've
revisited
at
least
15
times
since
then
.

The
atmosphere
ca
n't
be
beat
.
Love
the
space
.
-
Still
quite
noisy
;
certain
voices
-LRB-
and
annoying
laughs
-RRB-
seem
to
really
carry
here

The
staff
is
excellent
;
honest
,
helpful
,
friendly
,
courteous

truly
professional

Beer
list
remains
nearly
identical
to
what
it
was
6
months
ago
,
and
that
's
OK
by
me

Several
taps
on

Remains
one
of
my
very
favorite
places
to
visit.Finally
go
to
the
Tip
Top
last
night
for
dinner
and
had
a
great
experience
.
Great
job
with
the
remodel
,
and
the
outdoor
patio
is
very
nice
as
they
put
up
a
high
enough
fence
to
block
the
street
and
make
it
private
,
but
it
is
lareg
enough
to
be
fun
.
Excellent
liquor
and
beer
selections
at
reasonable
prices
.
Food
was
way
better
than
expected
-
huge
portions
,
excellent
quality
,
and
nicely
different
than
the
usual
Madtown
fare
.
We
had
fried
pickles
which
were
done
with
tempura
batter
so
they
were
not
heavy
and
the
slight
sweetness
of
the
batter
nicely
offset
the
brininess
of
the
pickles
.
Huge
basket
with
a
great
home
made
dipping
sauce
-LRB-
a
remoulade
-RRB-
as
well
.
Then
,
thank
God
cause
it
is
also
big
,
we
split
a
plate
of
two
pepper
mac
'n
cheese
,
which
was
cooked
perfectly
and
the
jalapenos
were
offset
perfectly
by
the
poblanos
for
a
flavorful
balance
.
Twelve
taps
,
good
cocktails
,
great
service
and
a
friendly
atmosphere
.
Hope
you
do
well
Tip
Top!I
started
going
here
on
and
off
about
eight
years
ago
.
The
pizza
is
the
best
,
but
the
burgers
-LRB-
veggie
and
regular
-RRB-
are
very
good
as
well
.
It
's
bar
food
at
its
very
best
.
Hot
chips
with
dipping
sauce
are
good
too
!
There
's
often
bands
on
the
weekends
,
and
the
occasional
lesbian
after
bowling
league
get
together
,
but
not
angry
,
man-hating
,
shemales
.
Quite
a
few
different

of
people
get
together
for
good

,
food
and
music
at
reasonable

Enjoy!Some
of
the
best
bar
food
in
the
state
.
Burgers
and
Pizza
are
always
a
fantastic
choice
.
Entertainment
is
hit
or
miss
,
but
at
least
they
have
some
.
However
,
my
favorite
reason
to
go
here
is
it
serves
the
coldest
tap
beer
ever
!!!
Pretty
cool
neighborhood
bar
that
's
a
lot
more
than
just
a
bar
.
I
mean
,
at
dinnertime
on
Friday
night
there
were
families
eating
here
with
lots
of
kids
.
That
's
kind
of
weird
to
me
.
First
,
I
would
n't
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
take
young
kids
to
a
bar
.
Second
,
I
do
n't
really
want
to
be
around
kids
when
I
go
to
a
bar
.
But
everyone
seemed
to
be
perfectly
happy
with
it
,
so
that
makes
me
the
odd
man
out
.
We
had
burgers
,
and
they
were
pretty
good
.
The
menu
had
all
the
usual
pub
grub
,
and
they
also
make
pizzas
.
Many
people
were
eating
them
,
but
we
did
n't
try
it
,
so
,
shrug
.
We
also
had
cheese
curds
.
They
were
,
well
,
cheese
curds
...
-LRB-
I
'm
sorry
,
I
'm
not
a
huge
fan
,
so
I
ca
n't
tell
the
quality
-RRB-
.
One
weird
thing
was
that
you
had
to
go
up
to
the
side
of
the
bar
to
place
your
order
.
This
made
it
confusing
how
to
leave
a
tip
.
On
the
table
,
or
with
the
person
you
placed
the
order
with
?
Overall
,
we
enjoyed
it
here
,
but
we
probably
would
n't
come
back
during
dinner
hour
,
as
the
atmosphere
was
a
bit
weird
for
us.I
go
to
the
Harmony
for
their
delicious
walnut
burgers
...
or
I
order
take
out
when
I
do
n't
feel
like
sitting
in
a
really
dark
bar
at
1pm
in
the
afternoon
.
The
Harmony
is
super
laid
back
,
full
of
young
and
old
,
the
noon
drinkers
and
the
nearly
dead
.
The
bartenders
are
nice
,
they
have
a
pool
table
and
juke
box
,
a
few
tv
's
...
I
would
say
it
's
definitely
more
of
an
older
crowd/neighborhood
bar
feel
,
which
is
pretty
refreshing
from
the
bars
full
of
dbags
on
State
Street
.
The
Harmony
is
a
solid
bar.I
just
want
to
mention
that
we
came
back
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
at
around
8:30
.
We
ordered
burgers
and
cheese
curds
.
They
tasted
a
lot
like
burgers
and
cheese
curds
.
I
also
do
n't
think
the
prices
are
that
great
on
further
reflection
.
6
dollars
for
a
stinkin
cheeseburger
?
That
's
not
great
...
3
dollars
for
a
pabst
?
But
the
place
was
kid
free
this
time
.
That
's
nice
.
I
would
give
higher
ratings
,
but
some
drunk
regular
yelled
at
us
for
ordering
from
the
menu
instead
of
the
``
board
.
''
Unpleasant.Harmony
,
I
blame
you
for
my
insatiable
craving
for
a
walnut
burger
coupled
with
your
hot
blue
cheese
chips
and
a
Spotted
Cow
.
Oh.My.God
.
Fantastic
!!!
Harmony
is
also
great
as
a
local
hang
out
with
the
neighborhood
guys
and
gals
.
Super
comfy
atmosphere
,
live
music
,
&
clean
bathrooms
.
All
very
good.The
Harmony
-
or
the
Har
Bar
as
my
friends
call
it
,
is
always
an
inviting
and
friendly
place
to
have
a
beer
.
It
's
a
neighborhood
bar
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
,
locals
walk
and
bike
to
the
place
which
is
situated
in
one
of
the
greatest
areas
of
Madison
.
The
food
is
really
nice
,
an
up-scaled
bar
menu
.
The
signature
dish
,
the
``
Walnut
Burger
''
is
truly
fantastic
.
Forget
about
it
as
a
meat-alternative
,
this
burger
is
a
unique
creation
all
its
own
that
will
make
you
have
desperate
cravings
.
The
space
is
large
,
divided
in
two
,
one
half
the
main
bar
area
and
the
other
a
large
space
with
family-style
tables
where
groups
gather
and
bands
sometimes
play
at
night
.
Here
you
will
find
the
livers
of
the
pure
Madison
lifestyle
celebrating
their
lives
.
These
people
are
happy
and
they
might
just
make
you
happy
too.The
hubby
and
I
always
default
to
Harmony
Bar
when
we
have
a
craving
for
a
good
burger
and
a
local
brew
-LRB-
even
before
noon
-RRB-
.
My
favorite
is
the
blue
burger-a
burger
smothed
in
blue
cheese
and
all
the
traditional
toppings
.
The
pizzas
are
worth
waiting
for-check
on
the
days
and
times
they
'll
make
a
pizza
for
you
.
As
always
a
smoke
free
environment
is
worth
driving
to
Madison
for.I
'm
not
a
local
,
which
means
I
do
n't
really
understand
the
appeal
of
the
Harmony
.
Hot
chips
and
dip
?
I
'll
eat
'em
,
but
they
're
not
the
stuff
dreams
are
made
of
.
Old-school
cafeteria-style
tables
?
Dim
lighting
,
rickety
tables
and
chairs
?
Kids
-LRB-
like
,
aged
6
and
under
-RRB-
running
wild
and
telling
my
group
of
adults
to
stop
swearing
?
Guess
I
'm
just
a
snob
.
On
the
plus
side
,
gin
&
tonics
were
$
3
each
on
a
Friday
night.Oh
how
I
miss
you
,
Harmony
Bar
!
I
never
miss
a
chance
to
grab
a
walnut
burger
and
hot
chips
when
I
'm
back
in
town
.
This
is
just
a
wonderful
neighborhood
bar
.
The
food
is
still
``
bar
''
food
but
it
's
quality
,
tasty
and
made
fresh
to
order
.
The
pizza
is
good
,
too
.
Good
beer
selection
and
a
truly
local
atmosphere
.
The
Harmony
fits
right
into
the
vibe
of
the
neighborhood
.
Oh
how
I
miss
you
,
Harmony
Bar!I
like
bars
that
are
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
,
but
they
do
n't
usually
have
good
food
.
Harmony
,
on
the
other
hand
,
manages
to
come
through
quite
nicely
in
the
food
department
.
I
had
a
walnut
burger
and
an
order
of
their
potato
chips
which
they
apparently
make
fresh
.
The
burger
was
great
.
Large
but
not
too
large
,
a
little
bit
messy
,
and
just
the
right
amount
of
toppings
.
The
chips
were
great
too
...
at
first
.
Though
I
have
to
say
that
they
started
to
feel
a
bit
heavy
about
half
way
through
.
They
're
still
good
,
just
be
warned
that
if
you
eat
an
entire
thing
of
chips
your
heart
might
explode.If
I
could
give
the
Harmony
less
than
one
star
,
I
would
.
I
live
in
the
Shenk-Atwood
neighborhood
,
so
I
'm
not
writing
as
an
outsider
.
I
've
been
to
the
Harmony
many
times
,
but
I
'm
finally
done
being
abused
by
the
notoriously
unfriendly
owner
,
bartenders
and
waitstaff
at
the
Harmony
.
The
Harmony
is
worse
than
Seinfeld
's
Soup
Nazi
because
there
's
no
irony
or
humor
in
being
treated
the
way
the
employees
here
treat
their
customers
.
I
wo
n't
get
into
specifics
.
I
can
only
say
that
I
take
pride
in
my
neighborhood
.
My
wife
and
I
frequent
those
establishments
that
understand
that
they
are
part
of
a
community
and
treat
their
paying
customers
as
such
.
The
Harmony
is
a
black
mark
on
our
neighborhood
,
and
I
am
ashamed
that
unsuspecting
visitors
to
the
quaint
east
side
should
have
to
endure
the
abusive
,
disrespectful
and
generally
unapologetic
service
at
this
establishment
.
If
you
scroll
down
you
'll
read
other
comments
about
the
owner
's
girlfriend
who
is
now
manager
.
The
last
time
I
was
in
there
with
a
group
of
friends
,
she
could
n't
have
been
more
rude
or
insulting
.
When
we
all
said
we
would
n't
be
back
,
she
merely
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
If
you
're
visiting
the
East
Side
,
there
are
plenty
of
other
places
that
serve
great
food
with
friendly
service
.
Alchemy
,
Mickey
's
,
Wilson
's
,
The
Weary
Traveller
all
come
to
mind
as
places
that
will
make
you
feel
and
taste
the
love
on
the
East
Side
.
If
you
're
a
masochist
,
be
sure
to
head
on
over
The
Harmony
for
your
daily
dose
of
abuse
.
You
've
been
warned
.
You
certainly
wo
n't
catch
me
sitting
at
this
bar
ever
again.The
unfriendly
atmosphere
at
The
Harmony
Bar
is
its
biggest
failing
.
At
first
I
thought
it
was
just
sarcastic
``
Soup
Nazi
''
humor
,
but
soon
realized
that
the
prevalent
hostile
attitude
there
is
genuine
and
that
it
trickles
down
from
management
to
employees
,
customers
,
and
even
performers
.
I
've
seen
bar
managers
there
either
berate
customers
directly
or
berate
the
bartenders
who
then
have
to
try
very
hard
not
to
pass
that
negativity
on
to
customers
.
Also
,
it
's
downright
embarrassing
to
be
an
audience
member
there
when
the
bar
mistreats
the
band
.
I
once
saw
a
Harmony
bar
manager
preempt
an
encore
performance
by
turning
on
the
overhead
lights
,
jumping
up
on
the
stage
,
and
literally
grabbing
the
mike
from
a
performer
to
announce
that
the
show
's
over
and
that
everybody
has
to
finish
their
drinks
and
leave
.
I
was
floored
.
It
was
the
first
time
I
'd
ever
seen
anyone
kick
a
band
off
the
stage
just
because
they
wanted
to
close
their
bar
early
.
The
kitchen
staff
works
hard
,
and
the
food
is
decent
.
Unfortunately
,
this
is
the
only
bar
I
've
ever
been
to
in
Madison
where
I
've
been
asked
to
pay
for
my
dinner
tab
up
front
.
-LRB-
There
are
lots
of
other
bars
that
also
do
n't
take
credit
cards
,
but
they
still
let
you
run
a
tab
.
-RRB-
It
made
me
wonder
if
they
did
n't
trust
me
to
close
out
my
tab
or
if
they
were
hoping
my
tip
would
be
better
prior
to
experiencing
their
poor
service
.
In
short
,
even
on
occasions
when
they
book
national
acts
,
it
's
not
worth
going
there
if
you
're
going
to
encounter
hostility
when
you
want
something
from
the
bar
.
There
are
too
many
other
fun
places
to
go
in
Madison
for
anyone
to
have
to
put
up
with
the
miserable
buzz
killing
atmosphere
that
prevails
at
The
``
Harmony
''
.
Burgers
are
awesome
whether
you
go
walnut
or
regular
.
Prompt
,
attentive
staff
.
Great
beers
on
tap
.
No
snobs
and
the
place
has
a
sense
of
humor
about
itself
.
It
's
good
stuff.This
is
where
YELP
gets
odd
-
any
idea
the
demographics
for
the
other
reviewers
?
As
a
neighborhood
bar
,
yes
you
are
expected
to
behave
-
and
geez
,
not
having
easy
tabs
going
and
having
to
pay
as
you
go
may
be
a
pain
.
But
really
?!
there
's
a
cash
machine
right
next
to
the
pool
table
.
Do
the
owners
have
a
right
to
close
down
when
it
's
bar
time
,
indeed
.
What
a
bunch
of
whinners
!
Drinks
are
served
well
and
timely
.
Food
is
good
.
Better
than
good
-
hot
,
made
to
order
,
and
fresh
.
Kids
are
expected
to
behave
-LRB-
and
ours
have
been
reminded
as
have
we
-
good
for
all
-RRB-
.
Do
we
go
there
for
yummy
,
fun
times
with
friends
,
yes
!
Are
we
grateful
a
local
,
privately
owned
business
maintains
it
's
unique
flavors
.
Yes
!
Cheers
to
the
Harmony!The
Harmony
grows
on
you
.
For
a
bar
of
its
kind
-LRB-
neighborhood
,
slightly
older
demographics
on
the
whole
,
cheapish
-RRB-
,
the
food
is
great
.
I
am
addicted
to
the
walnut
burger
with
cheese
.
It
is
vegetarian
and
one
of
two
or
three
dishes
I
'll
really
miss
when
I
leave
Madison
.
The
chips
and
blue
cheese
dip
are
also
awesome
.
I
've
tried
many
other
dishes
on
the
menu
,
and
the
Harmony
is
great
about
having
fresh
specials
,
many
of
which
are
vegetarian
.
They
've
all
been
good
to
great
.
I
love
sitting
at
the
bar
.
This
is
a
bar
that
no
matter
your
gender
,
you
can
go
and
eat
alone
at
and
not
feel
odd
or
out
of
place
.
The
bartenders
-LRB-
who
function
as
servers
-RRB-
are
neither
overly
friendly
nor
out
of
sight
.
They
are
attentive
,
but
leave
you
appropriately
alone
while
you
are
eating
and
drinking
.
Although
I
do
n't
have
kids
,
I
am
often
with
those
who
have
them
,
and
this
is
a
great
place
to
bring
kids
.
They
can
run
around
the
back
room
and
on
Fridays
,
you
'll
find
lots
of
other
kids
.
This
is
also
a
great
place
to
watch
sports
events
.
The
other
week
,
I
called
up
and
asked
if
the
bartenders
would
put
the
Tour
de
France
on
for
me
and
a
couple
of
friends
,
and
he
said
yes
and
gave
us
free
reign
of
the
large-screen
tv
in
the
back
.
Oh
yes
--
bring
cash
,
although
there
is
an
ATM
if
you
forget
to.The
perfect
place
for
the
near-east
side
.
Good
to
very
good
drinks
-LRB-
depending
on
the
bar
tender
-RRB-
and
yummy
pub
food
--
especially
the
walnut
burger
.
It
has
a
workaday
feel
,
with
a
side
of
liberal
politics
and
an
accepting
and
welcoming
attitude
.
Somehow
it
's
not
overpopulated
with
posers
which
makes
it
just
about
my
favorite
place
in
town.I
see
that
all
the

You

Harmony
bar
to
watch
the
Peoples
Brothers
Band
.
The
band
was
great
and
I
was
awarded
3rd
place
in
their
costume
contest
.
I
ordered
several
drinks
at
this
establishment
and
it
was
never
clear
to
me
what
the
beer
selections
were
.
Regardless
,
the

seemed
friendly
enough
and
it
was
a
fun
place
for
a
show.Who

To
anyone
considering

:
read

've
had
some

here
throughout
my

.
Many

.
Good
neighborhood
spot
.
Solid
7/10
bar
food
that
wo
n't
blow
your
mind
.
Some
servers
and
bartenders
are
nicer
than
others
.
Also
this
place
has
some
good
live
music
and
is
somewhat
famous
for
blues
acts
.
It
's
a
good
place
to
go
if
you
live
in
the
hood
but
I
would
skip
if
if
you
are
visiting.I
would
go
here
all
of
the
time
when
my
boyfriend
was
at
UW
.
So
good
,
smells
like
an
old
bar
.
A
real
old
fashioned
wooden
bar
soaked
in
booze
.
I
love
it
.
Has
a
pool
table
and
most
of
all
the
5
star
rating
is
for
the
walnut
burger
.
I
use
to
be
a
vegetarian
and
I
would
dream
about
eating
that
thing
,
better
than
meat
any
day
of
the
week
.
I
use
to
use
to
...
Good
times
:
-RRB-
I
had
a
walnut
burger
coupled
with
your
hot
blue
cheese
chips
...
it
was
ok.This
is
a
classic
Wisconsin
Tavern
and
I
enjoyed
watching
football
at
the
Harmony
.
No
bullshit
here.The
service
is
absolutely
horrible
.
The
staff
is
rude
and
acts
put
out
by
your
mere
presence!Ventured
in
to
the
Harmony
to
celebrate
the
closing
of
my
new
house
;
turns
out
it
's
located
about
1.5
blocks
from
my
new
pad
,
so
I
have
a
feeling
I
'll
be
getting
more
familiar
with
The
Harmony
.
What
a
cool
place
.
Awesome
bar
,
plenty
of
seating
,
live
music
-LRB-
although
with
a
cover
charge
...
boo
-RRB-
,
great
beer
selection
,
and
really
solid
food
.
I
tried
the
classic
cheeseburger
;
patties
were
hand-formed
and
cooked
to
a
perfect
medium
.
Cheese
curds
came
from
a
bag
,
but
were
some
of
the
better
ones
I
've
ever
tried
.
The
house-made
pub
chips
were
excellent
.
A
small
group
of
us
ate
and
drank
for
a
few
hours
;
the
total
tab
came
to
just
over
$
60
,
which
is
an
absolute
bargain
.
Service
was
prompt
and
efficient
,
making
for
a
great
overall
experience
.
I
'll
be
back
-LRB-
a
lot
-RRB-

Oh
,
and
check
out
the
daily
food
specials
-
looks
like
they
have
some
inventive
and
interesting
options!Great
local
place
in
the
Atwood
neighborhood
.
Pizzas
are
amazing
,
as
are
the
pretzels
.
Keith
and
staff
do
a
great
job
.
Plenty
of
local
brews
on
tap.I
'm
truly
a
carnivore
at
heart
,
but
the
walnut
burger
at
The
Harmony
is
quite
spectacular
&
totally
unique
-
great
flavor
,
great
texture
and
totally
satisfying
.
Paired
with
a
side
of
hot
chips
&
blue
cheese
dip
,
you
've
got
a
delicious
and
memorable
meal.This
is
my
neighborhood
bar
.
It
is
dependable
and
predictable
.
My
favorite
dish
is
the
chicken
breast
plate
with
the
Asian
noodles
.
The
chicken
is
moist
and
flavorful
every
time
.
I
love
their
homemade
chips
with
blue
cheese
but
I
try
to
steer
clear
.
I
always
pray
that
someone
else
at
the
table
will
order
them
and
I
can
sneak
a
few
.
Stolen
food
has
no

...
Really.This
is
one
of
those
places
that
you
feel
welcome
and
relaxed
as
soon
as
you
get
there
.
I
enjoy
the
food
,
the
walnut
burger
was
super
different
and
interesting
,
and
although
I
prefer
the
beef
it
was
fun
to
try
something
different
.
The
rest
of
the
food
was
as
good
as
bar
food
gets
,
but
the
staff
and
general
feel
of
the
bar
-LRB-
I
love
the
old
school
jukebox
!
-RRB-
makes
it
5
stars
for
me.First
rate
bar
food
,
better
than
many
restaurants
and
priced
right
.
You
cant
go
wrong
.
Under
new
ownership
but
this
has
n't
affected
quality
.
Great
blues
bar
too.Good
bar
food
.
Cash
only

Seat
yourself

come

sere

The
walnut
burger
was
decent
and
had
the
warm
chips
and
blue
cheese
dips
was
not
bad
.
Very
cozy
place
with
banquet
style
seating.Beer
selection
is
ok
.
Good
room
for
seeing

sound
was
great

of

male
staff
here
is
unapologetically
rude
&
disrespectful

that
could
care
less
that
you
're
there
.
Do
n't
waste
your
time
-
spend
your
money
at
Mickey
's
Tavern
or
Crystal
Corner
instead.I
've
been
to
the
Harmony
several
times
before
,
but
last
night
was
the
first
time
I
've
been
there
for
live
music
,
and
also
the
first
time
I
tried
their
famed
Walnut
Burger
.
First
,
you
should
know
that
the
Harmony
is
indeed
a
bar
.
If
you
go
expecting
an
upscale
``
gastro-pub
''
experience
of
chic
bar
food
,
then
you
will
be
disappointed
.
There
are
no
waiters
,
and
you
seat
yourself
.
You
order
food
and
drinks
at
the
bar
,
and
a
food
runner
brings
out
your
order
when
it
's
ready
.
Its
got
a
dive
bar
atmosphere
,
and
the
interior
is
pretty
run
down
.
After
fighting
for
a
table
due
to
the
crowd
that
was
rapidly
accumulating
in
anticipation
of
that
evening
's
band
,
my
friends
and
I
perused
the
menu
.
It
contains
primarily
stereotypical
bar
food
-LRB-
burgers
,
fries
,
onion
rings
,
etc
-RRB-
,
but
there
are
a
few
exceptions
.
There
are
several
vegetarian
options
,
including
veggie
nachos
,
so
if
you
're
a
non
meat
eater
,
you
would
probably
find
lots
of
things
to
order
at
The
Harmony
.
Most
notably
,
The
Harmony
offers
a
walnut
burger
.
I
'm
told
they
're
famous
for
it
,
so
I
ordered
the
walnut
burger
with
blue
cheese
and
a
side
of
homemade
potato
chips
with
``
Bleu
Cheese
Dip
''
.
-LRB-
What
can
I
say
,
I
really
,
really
love
Blue
Cheese
!
-RRB-
It
took
awhile
for
the
food
to
come
out
,
so
we
drank
beer
while
we
waited
.
Our
table
of
about
10
people
ordered
3
pitchers
to
share
.
I
am
not
sure
what
all
of
them
were
,
but
in
honor
of
the
WI
bar
experience
,
I
stuck
to
PBR
.
It
was
as
good
as
PBR
can
be
.
Onto
the
food
:
The
blue
cheese
walnut
burger
came
topped
with
a
creamy
blue
cheese
sauce
in
addition
to
blue
cheese
crumbles
,
rather
than
plain
blue
cheese
crumbles
like
I
had
been
anticipating
.
It
also
came
with
onion
,
lettuce
,
tomato
,
and
mayo
.
The
lettuce
and
tomato
were
exceptionally
fresh
and
ripe
looking
.
I
was
really
impressed
,
especially
by
the
tomato
-LRB-
it
was
actually
red
!
-RRB-
.
I
bit
into
it
and
was
immediately
transported
to
blue
cheese
heaven
.
It
was
fantastic
.
I
will
qualify
this
praise
with
the
statement
that
the
reason
I
loved
this
burger
so
much
was
largely
a
result
of
the
copious
blue
cheese
flavor
.
I
am
not
sure
the
walnut
burger
itself
was
why
it
tasted
so
great
.
The
chips
were
also
awesome
.
They
arrived
piping
hot
.
Some
were
crunchy
and
others
were
chewier
.
It
was
clear
that
they
were
made
to
order
.
The
Bleu
Cheese
Dip
they
came
with
was
similar
to
what
came
on
my
burger
,
and
as
a
result
,
was
amazing
.
We
ate
as
the
band
played
and
just
reveled
in
how
fun
the
whole
experience
was
.
By
the
way
,
the
band
was
great
!
It
was
a
Rockabilly
group
called
The
Fast
Clydes
.
If
you
like
that
style
of
music
,
I
could
n't
recommend
them
more
.
They
had
a
ton
of
energy
and
knew
how
to
work
the
crowd
.
I
had
a
blast
.
All
this
said
,
there
are
a
few
things
that
I
think
The
Harmony
could
improve
upon
.
First
off
,
the
tables
in
the
main
dining
area
are
plastic
.
They
're
the
exact
same
tables
that
you
played
beer
pong
on
in
college
.
I
feel
like
The
Harmony
excels
in
spite
of
its
dive
bar
atmosphere
,
and
not
necessarily
because
of
it
.
Therefore
,
if
they
invested
just
a
little
bit
of
money
to
spruce
up
the
interior
,
I
think
they
would
see
a
return
.
The
Atwood
area
is
still
rocking
that
hippie
vibe
,
for
sure
,
but
more
and
more
,
I
am
noticing
newer
and
more
upscale
establishments
.
To
me
,
that
says
that
there
's
probably
a
market
for
it
and
the
times
,
they
are
a
changin
'
.
Also
,
I
do
n't
mind
ordering
food
and
drinks
at
the
bar
.
However
,
I
think
The
Harmony
would
benefit
from
offering
table
service
,
at
least
during
shows
on
Friday
and
Saturday
night
.
I
have
only
ever
been
to
The
Harmony
with
a
group
,
and
it
sucks
to
have
to
walk
away
from
the
conversation
to
get
another
beer
,
a
process
which
can
take
10
or
15
minutes
if
it
's
crowded
.
All-in-all
,
these
drawbacks
are
minor
,
and
I
'll
be
back
at
The
Harmony
many
times
this
summer!It
's
been
nearly
a
year
since
I
've
become
somewhat
of
a
``
regular
''
here
,
so
it
's
probably
time
for
an
update

Last
visit
was
a
bit
funky
,
quite
literally
.
It
was
quite
sultry
inside
;
as
if
the
A/C
was
n't
on
,
or
could
n't
keep
up
.
Then
the
Harmony
's
softball
team
arrived
,
fresh
from
an
evening
of
playing
...
and
the
place
started
to
funk-up
,
odor-wise
.
Adding
insult
to
injury
,
the
bar
staff
and
kitchen
became
overwhelmed
...
I
sort
of
agree
with
Chopper
C
's
assessment
of
the
male
bartenders
-
they
're
quite
surly
and
often
seem
very
perterbed
,

Duh.Great
food
and
service
.
Thanks.I
stayed
away
from
this
chain
for
years
,
but
after
a
business
trip
forced
me
into
their
doors
multiple
nights
,
I
gave
my
home
location
another
chance
.
The
food
is
predictable
but
getting
more
adventurous
over
the
years
,
and
the
korean
tacos
are
pretty
exotic
.
I
try
not
to
eat
here
without
looking
at
the
nutritional
information
in
advance
;
the
one
time
I
did
n't
,
I
ate
half
an
appetizer
-LRB-
loaded
baked
potatoes
-RRB-
and
a
salad
and
found
out
that
was
2100
calories
.
There
were
also
pretty
substantial
delays
in
service
.
My
other
half
dozen
visits
have
had
excellent
service
and
well
prepared
food
.
Maybe
the
staff
was
n't
at
its
best
because
they
were
here
on
New
Year
's
Eve
?
Though
I
seldom
use
it
,
they
have
a
very
nice
drink
list
,
especially
if
you
're
a
fan
of
tequila
.
It
's
also
one
of
the
few
restaurants
I
know
that
offers
reward
points
for
eating
there
.
All
in
all
,
I
choose
to
go
here
for
a
standard
night
out
with
people
who
ca
n't
agree
on
what
they
want
to
eat.The
Korean
tacos
are
not
half
bad
,
and
the
kid
really
likes
the
burgers.My
boyfriend
and
I
went
here
because
we
had
a
$
25
gift
card
and
thought
we
'd
get
a
cheap
meal
.
Too
bad
TGI
Fridays
is
incredibly
overpriced
.
Maybe
it
's
my
own
fault
for
choosing
something
besides
a
hamburger
,
but
the
pasta
dinner
I
ordered
was
just
awful
.
It
was
clearly
a
frozen
meal
they
just
heated
up
-LRB-
I
asked
for
no
mushrooms
and
they
told
me
it
was
n't
possible
-RRB-
.
I
know
many
restaurants
do
this
,
but
when
I
get
a
$
50
bill
for
food
I
could
have
heated
up
at
home
it
does
n't
make
me
happy
.
Might
as
well
go
to
Denny
's
.
Same
quality
food
,
way
better
price.I
only
like
this
TGIFriday
's
.
Their
service
is
very
good
.
I
have
never
had
to
wait
more
then
10
minutes
to
get
a
table
.
The
food
there
is
very
good
.
Always
consistent
.
I
always
usually
order
their
House
Sirloin-10oz
.
It
is
always
juicy
and
flavorful
.
They
always
keep
sodas
and
other
drinks
full
and
their
manager
always
checks
on
you
to
make
sure
that
your
experience
is
a
good
one
.
Keep
up
the
good
work
!!!
Great
food
!
Prices
are
very
reasonable
for
the
amount
you
get
.
Always
very
busy
when
I
've
been
in
,
yet
service
is
still
great!Great
little
BBQ
joint
on
the
north
end
of
Madison
-
emphasis
on
little
.
The
place
has
perhaps
a
dozen
tables
,
most
only
able
to
seat
two
.
The
decorating
scheme
is
similar
to
a
log
cabin
,
with
varnished
wood
walls
and
ceiling
,
and
red
checkered
table
clothes
on
the
tables
.
The
food
is
wonderful
-
the
smoky
aroma
hits
you
as
soon
as
you
walk
in
the
door
.
The
half
rack
was
delicious
.
The
sauce
is
a
traditional
red
,
tangy
and
a
little
sweet
.
They
also
serve
the
sauce
on
the
side
if
you
order
a
pulled
pork
sandwich
,
which
is
nice.I
've
had
BBQ
across
this
great
land
of
ours
from
Austin
to
Dallas
to
NYC
to
LA
to
St
Louis
to
New
Orleans
and
places
in
between
and
I
'm
gon
na
share
a
secret
with
you
-
Smoky
Jon
's
is
the
best
BBQ
I
've
ever
had
.
The
ribs
and
pulled
pork
are
the
most
tender
,
perfectly
smoky
and
best
tasting
i
've
had
.
I
'm
not
an
evangelist
for
dry
rub
or
wet
rub
or
combo
-
all
I
want
is
good
tasting
grub
.
The
sauce
here
is
delicious
.
The
sides
here
are
also
some
of
the
best
.
The
baked
beans
have
little
pieces
of
pork
in
em
and
are
super
tasty
.
If
you
're
going
to
the
airport
its
right
by
the
entrance
-
make
a
quick
stop
and
you
wo
n't
be
disappointed
.
FYI
-
Jon
of
Smokey
Jon
's
has
won
BBQ
competitions
all
over
the
US
.
His
BBQ
grill
is
a
huge
pink
pig
that
he
hauls
on
the
back
of
his
truck
to
competitions
.
Jon
also
is
a
huge
big
nice
looking
man
.
He
knows
his
BBQ
probably
from
first
hand
experience.As
this
is
LITERALLY
my
favorite
restaurant
,
I
ca
n't
believe
it
's
taken
me
until
now
to
review
it
.
I
carry
a
bottle
of
Smoky
Jon
's
sauce
with
me
when
I
go
to
other
places
to
eat
.
That
's
how
good
it
is
.
The
pulled
pork
and
brisket
sandwiches
are
excellent
.
I
can
put
down
a
1/3
slab
of
ribs
,
a
pulled
pork
sandwich
and
their
super-excellent
fries
with
a
side
of
corn
like
it
's
nothing
.
My
only
small
gripe
is
that
sometimes
,
after
about
7:00
PM
-LRB-
they
close
at
9
-RRB-
,
the
ribs
seem
like
they
can
be
a
little
over-done
.
-LRB-
Not
as
tender

Smoky
Jon
's
turns
me
into
a
pig
,
and
I
love
every
delicious
mouthful.Went
here
tonight
based
on
Yelp
reviews
!
What
a
great
find
!
I
drove
by
this
place
on
my
way
to
work
for
a
YEAR
and
never
thought
to
stop
in
.
At
a
glance
,
it
does
n't
seem
like
much
.
Nestled
-LRB-
snugly
-RRB-
between
two
other
buildings
you
can
almost
miss
it
.
I
'm
so
glad
we
stopped
in
!
It
has
that
true
BBQ
joint
atmosphere
-
checkered
cloth
tables
-LRB-
each
complete
with
it
's
own
roll
of
paper
towels
-RRB-
,
wood
paneling
,
and
Southern
blues
playing
overhead
.
You
order
at
the
counter
off
of
a
big
overhead
wood
sign
,
and
they
bring
piles
of
saucy
goodness
to
your
table
.
This
place
is
littered
with
awards
for
their
barbecue
.
I
guess
the
owner
travels
and
competes
-LRB-
and
a
lot
of
times
,
wins
-RRB-
at
national
cook-offs
.
I
got
the
1/3
slab
rib
and
beef
brisket
combo
.
The
ribs
were
super
yummy
.
Flavor-full
,
but
not
too
smokey
.
The
brisket
was
nice
too
,
not
too
fatty
.
I
would
say
that
the
house
sauce
has
that
vinegar-like
tang
.
It
's
sweet
and
spicy
and
tart
all
at
the
same
time
.
Nice
.
My
saucy
side
dish
-LRB-
aka
boyfriend
-RRB-
ordered
the
turkey
,
which
we
both
thought
was
good
...
but
nothing
amazing
.
The
sides
were
really
tasty
too
.
The
beans
were
delish
,
and
the
sugar-buns
-LRB-
read
:
fried
dough
dusted
with
confectioners
'
sugar
-RRB-
were
n't
too
bad
either
.
We
both
left
with
tingling
tongues
,
full
bellies
,
and
smiles
on
our
faces
.
*
just
a
note
--
parking
in
the
``
lot
''
is
super
sparse
and
hard
to
navigate
in
and
out
of
...
the
only
drawback!Smoky
Jon
's
rack
o
'
ribs
puts
all
other
rib
places
,
and
places
that
serve
ribs
to
shame
.
The
portions
are
ginormous
and
the
meat
is
tender
.
The
sauce
that
's
slathered
everywhere
is
spicy
,
tangy
,
sweet
but
not
disgustingly
so
,
and
smokey
.
It
reminds
me
of
sitting
around
a
campfire
roasting
some
damn
fine
meat
,
slathering
it
up
in
top
notch
BBQ
sauce
and
then
grubbin
'
happily
.
For
sides
we
had
baked
beans
,
garlic
mashed
potatoes
and
dinner
rolls
.
However
after
stuffing
ourselves
with
tons
of
ribs
there
was
no
room
for
the
sides
!
We
ordered
out
because
the
dining
area
in
Smoky
Jon
's
is
teeny
tiny
and
the
parking
lot
is
even
worse
.
Truly
,
my
only
complaint
was
that
I
spent
all
night
in
the
bathroom
after
eating
here
.
I
think
that
's
because
my
system
was
just
not
prepared
for
the
rich
,
smokey
,
deliciousness
that
I
have
never
experienced
before
.
So
it
was
worth
it
!
YAY
!!!

Disturbing!Thank
God

When
I
was
an
undergrad
in
Madison
back
in
96
,
we
scoured
the
city
in
search
of
decent
bbq
to
no
avail
.
I
'm
moving
back
in
August
and
now
know
at
least
3
places
where
I
will
be
dining
in
that
first
week
.
This
is
one
of
them
and
I
look
forward
to
it
.
It
just
unfortunate
that
it
's
on
a
street
named
after
the
Packers
...
boo
.
Go
Bears

-RRB-
Small
little
joint
,
good

,
fast
in
,
eat
,
fast
out.Staff
is
super
helpful
when
my
party
could
n't
decide
what
we
wanted
.
Service
was
fast
and
packaged
quite
well
-LRB-
take
out
-RRB-
.
Barbecue
pork
shoulder
was
good
,
ribs
were
great
,
buns
were
good
.
Something
was
n't
quite
right
with
the
sides
though
,
we
had
coleslaw
,
potato
salad
,
fries
and
beans
-LRB-
though
I
did
n't
try
the
beans
-RRB-
and
while
they
were
good
,
they
were
underseasoned
and
just
missing
something
.
Overall
a
very
satisfying
experience
and
I
would
definitely
go
back!Yeah
,
for
realz
...
all
the
awards
,
accolades
,
etc.
,
are
spot
on
.
Best
ribs
I
can
remember
having
in
a
very
,
very
,
very
long
time
-
perhaps
ever
.
I
especially
liked
the
end
portions
of
the
slab
that
somehow
dodged
the
sauce
and
were
on
the
tougher
side
-LRB-
think
jerky
-RRB-
.
That
alone
was
fantastic
.
Unfortunately
,
much
like
the
Cookie
Monster
now
says
that
cookies
are
sometimes
food
,
these
delicious
ribs
are
sometimes
food
too
.
Every
now
and
then
though
,
I
might
have
my
Cookie
Monster
moment
where
sometimes
is
NOW!I
'm
not
a
die
hard
BBQ
fan
nor
do
I
normally
spring
for
it
when
I
'm
hungry
but
after
eating
here
I
may
change
my
tune
.
The
ribs
are
amzaing
,
the
meat
practically
falls
off
the
bone
and
is
so
tender
!!
The
pulled
pork
sandwich
is
equally
delicious
and
the
serving
size
is
more
than
generous
.
The
sweet
bisquits
are
a
nice
way
to
end
the
meal
,
served
piping
hot
and
covered
in
powdered
sugar
;
although
ordering
them
serperate
is
recommended
as
the
baked
beans
and
fries
are
a
must
have
!!
I
may
be
a
little
biased
since
I
've
grown
up
on
these
ribs
but
damn
it
if
these
are
n't
great
ribs
I
have
no
clue
what
are
.
Got
off
the
plane
and
the
first
thing
on
my
mind
is
ribs
.
It
's
right
next
to
the
airport
.
Even
if
you
are
there
for
a
layover
just
take
a
cab
up
the
street
and
get
yourself
a
full
slab
of
pork
ribs
with
two
sides
for
only
20
bucks
.
That
's
enough
food
for
3
people
folks
.
If
you
ai
n't
keen
on
sharing
with
your
nasty
,
always
sick
,
finger
licking
companion
-LRB-
s
-RRB-
then
they
have
individual
meals
too
.
The
meat
is
fall
off
the
bone
tender
and
juicy
.
The
bbq
sauce
is
what
I
judge
other
sauces
by
.
It
's
vinegary
and
a
little
sweet
and
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
.
If
you
are
in
Madison
and
you
crave
ribs
then
this
is
the
only
place
you
should
think
of.mmmm
...
eerrrr
...
this
is
not
real
barbeque
.
The
ribs
do
n't
taste
bad
,
but
they
are
n't
cooked
slow
enough
,
because
the
meat
does
n't
fall
off
the
bone
and
all
the
flavor
comes
from
the
sauce
that
's
slathered
on
it
,
not
the
actual
meat
.
The
turkey
was
a
insult
to
the
art
of
barbecuing
--
it
tasted
like
deli
meat
that
had
been
sprayed
with
liquid
smoke.BEST
SWEET
MEAT
IN
MADISON
!
The
sauce
is
unique
and
fantastic
with
tiny
onion
pieces
in
it
contributing
a
bite
to
the
sweetness
of
the
base
with
it
's
slight
tang
.
The
meat
is
prepared
exactly
how
you
'd
expect
--
falling
off
the
bone
with
a
slight
resistance
.
I
'd
kill
for
these
ribs
!
...
I
'm
serious
...
For
take
out
,
I
find
the
ribs
to
be
a
little
under
sauced
.
I
bought
a
bottle
of
Smoky
Jon
's
Sauce
to
take
home
to
load
up
the
ribs.After
hearing
that
this
place
was
the
bees
knees
from
many
friends
and
reviews
,
I
decided
to
take
a
small
group
of
friends
and
give
it
the
test
.
Afterwards
I
was
impressed
and
absolutely
full
,
but
I
would
n't
give
it
the
BBQ
crown
.
I
think
most
of
the
value
here
comes
from
its
uniqueness
.
Smoky
Jon
's
sits
in
a
small
little
log-cabin-style
shack
,
and
when
you
walk
in
you
are
witness
to
the
plethora
of
awards
they
have
received
from
their
delicious
BBQ
fixins
.
Soon
,
you
'll
discover
their
own
personal
sauce
-LRB-
which
I
hope
you
slather
across
your
food
-RRB-
,
and
a
menu
that
has
item
descriptions
which
make
you
want
to
grow
a
second
stomach
.
Corn
bread
,
beans
,
ribs
,
brisket
,
pulled
pork
,
etc
;
all
the
delectable
food
you
'd
expect
from
a
place
like
this
.
I
personally
had
ribs
and
brisket
with
corn
bread
,
and
I
ate
every
last
bite
with
no
regrets
.
Problem
is
,
I
've
had
some
really
good
Barbecue
in
my
life
,
and
the
overall
taste
of
the
food
,
while
good
,
was
n't
great
in
comparison
.
Some
of
the
places
I
've
dined
at
in
Kansas
City
,
for
instance
,
were
a
step
up
from
this
.
Even
some
of
the
dishes
at
Famous
Daves
could
rival
Smoky
Jon
's
,
although
the
ribs
certainly
could
not
.
The
rest
of
my
party
all
had
mixed
responses
.
My
girlfriend
did
n't
really
care
for
what
she
ordered
-LRB-
I
ca
n't
remember
what
it
was
,
a
sandwich
of
some
sort
-RRB-
,
and
several
of
them
did
n't
like
the
smallishness
of
the
place
or
the
service
.
The
lady
was
OK
,
but
she
was
behind
the
counter
mostly
and
did
n't
do
much
to
make
us
feel
welcome
.
When
we
walked
in
we
were
all
really
excited
to
be
there
and
try
it
,
and
she
was
just
kind
of
``
meh
.
''
Also
,
the
location
is
probably
the
least
desirable
of
any
restaurant
I
've
been
to
in
Madison
,
but
that
's
more
relative
to
where
you
live
or
how
you
feel
about
certain
neighborhoods
.
Overall
,
worth
a
try
and
probably
one
of
the
better
BBQs
as
far
as
Madison
goes
.
While
it
does
n't
get
the
full
star
ride
from
me
,
I
can
see
why
others
give
it
high
praise.Me
and
my
boyfriend
were
driving
from
the
dells
back
to
Illinois
and
we
were
getting
hungry
for
lunch
.
We
decided
to
skip
all
the
fast
food
chains
you
can
get
anywhere
and
decided
to
let
yelp
tell
u
where
to
eat
.
We
searched
high
ratings
in
Madison
and
we
stumbled
upon
Smoky
Jon
's
.
It
did
not
disappoint
.
It
was
also
conviently
located
close
to
the
highway
.
We
ordered
the
ribs
and
brisket
sandwich
.
The
best
part
is
the
sauce
.
I
wish
I
brought
home
a
bottle
of
sauce
.
I
will
definately
go
back
if
I
'm
ever
in
Madison
again
!!
This
place
is
running
on
the
fact
that
there
really
is
no
good
BBQ
in
Madison
.
And
Smoky
Jon
,
if
that
is
his
real
name
,
may
have
won
a
lot
of
awards
,
but
he
is
not
selling
that
winning
BBQ
at
this
location
.
I
got
off
a
plane
starving
after
a
long
business
weekend
and
I
could
not
eat
the
ribs
that
were
served
because
the
tips
were
burnt
and
more
like
chewing
tobacco
than
ribs
.
I
would
n't
mention
the
sides
because
that
is
not
why
you
go
to
these
places
,
but
Jon
you
need
to
get
off
the
beach
in
Cancun
and
work
on
these
recipes
,
they
ST-I-N-K
.
Smoky
Jon
's
is
some
of
the
best
BBQ
I
've
had
in
Madison
.
However
,
I
have
n't
tried
many
places
,
so
that
's
not
saying
much
.
I
really
enjoy
the
ribs
and
the
pork
shoulder
sandwich
.
The
brisket
is
good
as
well
.
I
have
found
all
the
barbecued
menu
items
to
be
flavorful
and
tender
.
The
burgers
are
n't
that
good
,
however
;
they
're
overdone
and
greasy
.
The
sides
also
leave
something
to
be
desired
.
I
've
never
had
a
bad
side
dish
,
but
I
've
only
really
been
impressed
by
the
fried
biscuits
.
The
mashed
potatoes
are
runner-up
.
The
pasta
salad
and
potato
salad
are
both
well
below
average
.
Service
at
Smoky
Jon
's
is
both
quick
and
friendly
.
Employees
will
remember
you
,
which
is
always
nice
.
The
prices
are
good
.
The
location
is
a
little
iffy
,
though
;
the
parking
lot
is
too
small
and
the
building
itself
can
feel
cramped
.
All
problems
aside
,
I
will
keep
coming
here
for
the
delicious
BBQ.I
've
had
BBQ
all
over
the
country
but
the
sauce
here
is
my
kind
of
flavor
.
The
meat
is
so
tender
and
juicy
it
hardly
needs
sauce
,
but
the
sauce
is
so
good
I
have
to
get
an
extra
cup
on
the
side
!
All
the
sides
are
tasty
so
you
ca
n't
go
wrong
there
.
``
Forrest
,
what
's
going
on
with
them
damn
sugar
fried
biscuits
!
''
Yes
,
that
is
what
I
literally
heard
there
.
This
was
followed
by
a
refund
on
some
of
our
meal-more
on
that
later
.
My
friend
is
a
UW
student
and
after
deciding
to
visit
him
he
took
us
here
to
eat
.
We
ordered
the
brisket
,
rib
and
chicken
.
The
brisket
was
cut
,
almost
chipped
with
a
tangy/sweet
sauce
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
at
the
end
and
little
bits
of
onions
that
were
chewy/crunchy
.
I
asked
the
person
taking
my
order
about
his
recommendations
for
sides
.
He
said-definitely
the
fries
and
the
baked
beans
.
The
baked
beans
were
delicious
!
Also
sweet
with
a
little
kick
at
the
end
and
then
with
a
little
sweetness
to
it
.
I
just
want
to
take
the
time
right
now
to
say
that
I
hate
beans-the
consistency
of
it
and
the
way
that
they
're
often
overloaded
with
lard/butter
.
As
mentioned
above
,
yummy
and
on
top
of
that
he
said
that
if
I
did
n't
like
either
of
the
sides
he
recommended
to
let
him
know
and
he
would
get
me
something
else
.
I
tried
the
ribs
which
were
so
soft
that
it
basically
came
apart
in
my
fingers
,
the
sauce
was
consistent
throughout
.
My
friend
placed
an
order
of
the
`
doughnuts
'
as
he
called
it
but
they
were
sugar
fried
biscuits
.
We
waited
and
waited
,
ordered
them
to-go
and
even
then
they
were
n't
ready
.
The
counter-man
,
who
must
have
been
the
manager
then
asked
the
unseen
Forrest
what
was
going
on
with
the
damn
sugar
fried
biscuits
and
then
said
he
was
going
to
give
back
the
money
for
the
biscuits
.
That
's
really
an
extra
step
in
fixing
a
slight
problem
in
an
otherwise
small
kink.BBQ
Sauce
is
spectacular
.
But
the
restaurant
is
horrible
--
uncomfortable
dining
room
,
prices
way
too
high
to
be
a
no-service
,
order
at
the
counter
place
,
sides
are
minuscule
in
tiny
cups
,
and
there
's
no
bar
,
not
even
beer
!
What
's
BBQ
without
beer
to
go
with
it
?
Prices
are
way
over
the
top
for
Madison
.
Stop
by
for
some
takeout
pulled
pork
,
or
buy
a
bottle
of
exceptional
BBQ
sauce
and
do
it
yourself
at
home.Amazing
ribs
and
sauce
.
The
chicken
is
pretty
good
,
too
.
Problems
are
:
-
Small
,
relatively
unimpressive
sides
-LRB-
those
mashed
potatoes
are
definitely
instant
-RRB-
.
-
They
charge
you
for
sharing
!
Even
when
my
boyfriend
and
I
were
ordering
take-out
a
la
carte
ribs
on
the
phone
,
they
asked
him
if
he
would
be
sharing
with
anyone
so
they
could
tack-on
that
extra
$
1.50
!
What
's
up
with
that
?
-
The
dine-in
experience
-LRB-
like
many
have
already
posted
-RRB-
is
n't
great
,
since
it
's
so
small
and
there
's
no
beer
.
All
that
said
,
Smoky
Jon
's
has
the
best
ribs
in
town
.
Trust
me
,
I
've
tried
every
rib
spot
in
Madison.Best
BBQ
in
Madison
.
Hands
down
.
Only
loses
a
star
for
consistently
messing
up
take-out
orders
and
not
being
up
to
par
compared
to
places
in
the
south.Wtf
!!!
Superb
!!!!
1/2

In

No

they

Awesome
,
awesome
ribs
.
I
love
BBQ
and
this
place
is
the
real
deal
.
When
I
saw
the
``
no
1
''
in
the
name
of
the
restaurant
I
laughed
because
that
's
a
tall
glass
to
fill
and
I
was
prepared
to
tear
them
down
on
Yelp
if
it
was
n't
true
,
but
they
blew
me
and
my
taste
buds
away
.
I
could
go
on
,
but
let
me
put
it
this
way
:
Next
Monday
I
'm
flying
into
Madison
for
work
for
what
will
likely
be
my
last
trip
to
WI
for
a
while
.
My
coworkers
and
I
have
already
agreed
that
we
're
driving
straight
from
the
airport
to
get
lunch
.
Now
I
just
need
to
decide
...
ribs
or
brisket
?
-LRB-
Note
,
I
went
twice
so
that
I
could
have
both
the
ribs
AND
the
brisket
:-RRB-
-RRB-
I
had
the
brisket
sandwich
,
he
had
the
ribs
.
Brisket
was
a
little
fatty
,
but
I
loved
the
bbq
sauce
.
Baked
beans
were
delicious!I
take
my
BBQ
seriously
and
because
of
that
I
researched
on-line
via
Yelp
and
other
sites
various
reviews
of
BBQ
places
in
Madison
,
finally
deciding
on
Smoky
Jon
's
No
1
B-B-Q
.
Clearly
the
ribs
have
been
highly
reviewed
so
I
actually
went
for
the
full
slab
.
Then
it
was
a
choice
between
the
chopped
pork
sandwich
and
the
brisket
sandwich
,
I
went
for
the
pork
sandwich
from
my
fond
memories
of
the
same
in
Alabama
.
Ordering
over
the
phone
,
everything
seemed
to
go
well
.
I
then
arrived
about
a
half
hour
later
.
There
was
1
person
in
front
of
me
who
paid
and
was
getting
ready
to
leave
when
they
brought
my
order
to
the
counter
and
it
was
clearly
wrong
.
They
had
given
my
order
to
the
man
before
me
and
I
had
his
.
Apparently
we
both
had
the
same
first
name
.
Now
this
I
was
not
perturbed
by
and
was
okay
with
,
it
was
what
followed
that
made
me
give
this
place
1
star
.
So
the
counter
lady
tells
me
she
'll
take
care
of
me
first
before
resolving
his
issue
,
great
!
So
she
charges
my
card
for
64.66
which
was
clearly
way
more
than
I
should
have
paid
for
1
slab
dinner
and
1
pork
sandwich
+
1
side
of
fried
dough
.
Should
have
been
1/2
that
.
I
told
her
and
she
could
n't
understand
what
I
was
talking
about
,
I
had
to
over-explain
what
I
ordered
and
finally
got
through
to
her
.
She
took
the
bag
back
to
the
kitchen
area
saying
some
guy
would
have
to
deal
with
fixing
this
problem
.
Now
I
was
getting
irritated
.
She
refunds
me
around
32
bucks
in
cash
to
make
up
for
the
overcharge
.
I
get
a
new
bag
of
food
and
am
finally
done
with
the
transaction
,
took
about
15
mins
to
resolve
.
Fine
,
I
was
happy
in
knowing
I
had
a
great
dinner
to
enjoy
soon
.
So
I
come
back
and
begin
with
the
ribs
,
1/2
a
slab
.
From
the
first
taste
I
was
not
impressed
.
I
've
had
better
ribs
all
over
the
country
from
Los
Angeles
to
Alabama
to
Texas
and
Chicago
.
Seriously
?
This
place
has
won
all
kinds
of
awards
,
I
do
n't
get
it
.
Almost
every
other
place
I
've
eaten
ribs
in
my
40
+
years
of
life
has
been
better
than
this
place
.
The
``
sugar-fried
''
biscuits
are
nothing
with
nothing
,
you
can
get
better
donuts
nearly
anywhere
,
seriously
-LRB-
again
-RRB-
.
The
fries
dipped
in
the
BBQ
sauce
were
the
best
part
by
far
.
The
corn
was
pretty
good
too
,
but
still
a
little
over
the
top
on
the
taste
,
hard
to
describe
.
So
after
being
disappointed
,
I
checked
out
the
pork
sandwich
,
and
oddly
enough
there
were
3
small
containers
with
the
sandwich
,
and
somehow
it
did
n't
look
like
pork
either
.
I
examined
further
,
it
was
chicken
,
yet
another
screw-up
with
my
order
,
wow
!
And
I
ordered
fries
and
mashed
potatoes
,
neither
of
which
was
included
.
Instead
I
found
off-the-shelf
beans
,
apple
sauce
-LRB-
why
?
-RRB-
which
is
not
homemade
,
just
spooned
out
of
the
jar
,
and
the
third
container
was
BBQ
sauce
,
which
I
did
n't
need
since
I
bought
a
whole
bottle
.
So
the
other
part
of
my
order
was
completely
wrong
in
every
respect
.
And
note
,
the
chicken
was
not
anything
to
write
home
about
either
.
I
drove
to
the
other
side
of
Madison
,
which
was
a
fairly
pleasant
1/2
hour
drive
,
paid
around
33
bucks
for
a
very
disappointing
experience
.
I
strongly
recommend
NOT
going
to
this
place
,
unless
you
like
to
take
risks
,
maybe
you
'll
like
what
you
find
,
I
know
that
if
this
is
the
best
in
Madison
,
I
'll
have
to
go
elsewhere
in
the
world
to
find
good
BBQ
.
Oh
well
...
Great
BBQ
!
It
's
a
little
out
of
the
way
,
but
worth
the
journey
if
you
're
looking
for
decent
BBQ
.
I
do
n't
remember
seeing
any
highchairs
.
We
ended
up
bringing
in
our
stroller
for
our
daughter
to
sit
in
.
While
you
have
to
order
your
food
at
the
counter
,
there
is
a
wait
staff
that
will
bring
your
food
to
you
and
refill
your
drinks
.
No
alcoholic
beverages
...
-LRB-
that
's
why
4
stars
-RRB-
.
Love
the
sauce
,
corn
,
fries
,
everything
I
've
tried!Finally
got
to
Smoky
Jon
's
for
the
first
time
yesterday
.
The
brisket
sandwich
was
delicious
and
I
am
pretty
sure
I
would
eat
a
flip-flop
if
it
was
drenched
in
their
BBQ
sauce
.
Looking
forward
to
going
back
for
the
ribs
and
chopped
pork.Ribs
were
good
,
but
sauce
was
a
little
too
sweet
.
Review
was
so
close
to
4
stars
but
the
corn
was
cooked
in
margarine
.
Really
?
Margarine
?
C'mon
you
're
in
Wisconsin.We
tried
to
go
to
this
place
on
a
Monday
;
oops
,
not
open
.
After
10
months
of
living
in
the
Madison
area
,
we
have
found
THE
RIB
PLACE
.
The
ribs
are
great
,
so
is
the
brisket
,
the
corn
,
beans
...
you
get
the
idea
.
The
restaurant
is
a
little
small
but
the
service
was
amazing
.
Watching
my
family
eat
was
almost
as
good
as
the
food
,
almost
.
I
highly
recommend
Smoky
Jon
's
#
1
BBQ
.1
/
2
slab
and
pork
shoulder
with
sugar
fried
biscuits
and
garlic
mashed
potatoes
.
We
need
one
of
these
in
Philadelphia
.
The
BBQ
was
so
tender
and
flavorful
.
Sides
were
good
but
not
as
amazing
as
the
meat
.
Will
definitely
be
back
to
try
the
brisket
before
I
head
back
east
.
The
restaurant
itself
is
small
and
cramped
but
the
food
is
worth
it.Long
story
short
...
Pork
ribs
are
amazing
.
I
've
had
ribs
all
over
the
US
and
the
ones
here
compare
favorably
with
all
of
them
.
The
meat
falls
off
of
the
bones
and
have
a
smoky
flavor
.
The
sauce
is
also
quite
tasty
with
a
tinge
of
spices
.
The
beef
brisket
and
pork
shoulder
are
fairly
average.This
is
pretty
good
bbq
for
madison
,
but
that
does
n't
say
that
much
.
I
have
n't
been
everywhere
in
town
,
but
honestly
I
think
Famous
Dave
's
is
better
.
Basically
its
decent
food
,
but
if
you
've
had
real
bbq
somewhere
like
memphis
,
kansas
city
,
st.
louis
,
or
anywhere
south
of
wisconsin
,
you
will
be
disappointed.Well
this
is
a
tough
one
.
A
few
years
back
,
I
stopped
going
to
SJ
`
sbecause
I
was
sick
of
getting
rubbery
non
tender
ribs
.
In
the
90
's
,
you
could
always
count
on
getting
the
BEST
ribs
around
,
EVERY
time
.
I
think
that
the
fact
that
Jon
worked
there
then
made
the
difference
.
Since
he
retired
,
I
dont
know
what
happened
exactly
?
However
,
recently
I
stopped
in
for
a
shoulder
platter
,
and
everything
was
great
,
so
go
figure
.
The
sauce
is
fantastic
,
and
when
done
well
,
this
place
is
something
special.Went
here
with
a
couple
of
friends
after
work
one
night
.
We
'd
been
looking
for
a
good
BBQ
place
in
Madison
,
and
Smoky
Jon
's
was
the
first
place
we
tried
.
Needless
to
say
,
we
wo
n't
be
trying
any
place
else
!
The
first
thing
that
struck
me
was
the
great
atmosphere
in
the
restaurant
.
It
's
a
small
place
,
maybe
15
tables
total
,
and
there
's
blues
music
playing
in
the
background
.
We
put
our
order
in
at
the
front
window
and
then
grabbed
a
couple
of
tables
.
We
grabbed
a
couple
of
tables
and
did
n't
have
to
wait
very
long
before
our
food
was
brought
out
.
Oh
was
the
food
good
.
I
ordered
a
1/3
slab
of
ribs
and
the
pulled
pork
sandwich
combo
platter
.
The
pork
was
piled
on
it
's
bun
in
plentiful
quantities
.
It
was
pretty
good
,
the
pork
had
good
flavor
and
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
was
n't
quite
as
tender
and
juicy
as
some
of
the
homemade
stuff
I
've
had
.
The
ribs
,
though
,
were
amazing
.
The
meat
was
incredibly
tender
.
More
importantly
,
though
,
was
that
there
was
a
lot
of
meat
on
each
bone
.
I
'm
used
to
seeing
skimpy
ribs
get
served
at
restaurants
where
you
're
left
wanting
more
after
a
full
rack
.
Here
,
in
just
4
bones
I
found
I
was
very
full
.
Smoky
Jon
's
sauce
was
a
great
compliment
to
the
meat
as
well
.
Good
full
flavor
with
a
nice
little
kick
at
the
end
.
The
sides
were
equally
excellent
.
The
baked
beans
are
a
must
,
and
I
saved
mine
for
the
end
so
that
's
the
flavor
I
would
leave
with
.
I
also
had
the
sugar
fried
biscuits
that
were
pretty
good
too
.
The
highlight
of
the
meal
,
though
,
was
something
one
of
my
friends
had
ordered
.
The
restaurant
also
had
chili
available
-LRB-
which
may
just
be
a
seasonal
item
-RRB-
.
It
was
served
with
a
fork
rather
than
a
spoon
,
and
with
good
reason
.
I
've
never
seen
chili
that
was
that
thick
and
meaty
.
I
was
able
to
get
a
taste
of
it
and
was
floored
by
how
great
the
flavors
were
.
It
was
so
good
that
I
almost
went
back
up
to
order
some
chili
to
go
for
the
next
day
.
Smoky
Jon
's
is
a
must
for
BBQ
fans
in
Madison
.
The
prices
are
good
,
the
food
is
delicious
,
and
the
atmosphere
is
perfect
.
We
will
be
going
back
sooner
rather
than
later.It
gets
4
stars
for
being
great
BBQ
AND
being
this
far
in
Yankee
country
.
I
'd
probably
rate
it
at
3.5
stars
if
I
could
so
that
my
scores
relative
to
this
one
would
make
more
sense
overall
.
But
I
digress
...
I
ordered
the
ribs
and
a
brisket
sandwich
with
the
spicy
corn
and
the
baked
beans
for
dinner
about
two
weeks
ago
.
The
verdicts
:
Ribs
=
VERY
well
done
.
Tender
,
pull-off-the-bone
and
delicious
.
The
sauce
is
where
you
get
the
refinement
too
-LRB-
beyond
the
smoking
process
of
course
,
which
is
an
art
in
itself
-RRB-
.
There
are
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
in
the
sauce
and
it
's
not
overdone
in
terms
of
application
.
I
've
eaten
BBQ
everywhere
and
this
place
's
ribs
stand
up
with
anyone
's
.
Brisket
Sandwich
=
Boring
.
I
was
told
what
I
was
ordering
,
so
kudos
to
the
service
because
they
were
dead
on
.
It
was
less
of
a
sandwich
and
more
of
brisket
on
a
plain
roll
.
That
's
fine
of
course
,
but
for
some
reason
I
feel
like
sandwich
does
n't
describe
this
well
.
It
does
remind
me
of
the
bare
minimum
approach
you
find
in
many
BBQ
joints
around
,
but
I
do
n't
like
it
there
either
.
Anyway
,
the
brisket
was
very
tasty
and
you
should
just
order
it
on
its
own
.
No
point
in
getting
a
piece
of
bread
that
just
hides
the
taste
of
good
BBQ
.
Spicy
Corn
=
Awesome
.
Truly
delicious
stuff
,
and
I
plowed
through
it
in
30
seconds
.
Perfect
amount
of
spice
too
.
Wish
I
had
a
little
more
in
that
serving
,
but
it
will
bring
me
back
...
soooo
mission
accomplished
?
Baked
Beans
=
Awesome
.
I
asked
if
they
were
made
in
house
,
I
was
told
that
they
were
and
my
palate
was
rewarded
with
some
of
the
finest
baked
beans
one
can
find
.
Thick
,
almost
pasty
-LRB-
in
a
good
way
-RRB-
and
chock
full
of
flavor
.
The
only
downfalls
would
be
that
it
's
somewhat
pricey
for
what
you
get
,
but
food
is
going
up
everywhere
.
I
also
ordered
a
sandwich
combo
,
which
was
a
mistake
.
The
service
was
top
notch
.
Everything
and
more
was
explained
to
me
in
detail
.
I
only
have
myself
to
blame
for
trying
that
damn
sandwich
combo
.
Please
take
it
off
of
the
menu
...
your
customers
are
getting
punished
for
ordering
it
and
it
takes
away
from
what
you
do
best
.
The
decor
is
nice
and
very
`
southern
'
in
the
sense
that
this
is
without
a
doubt
a
BBQ
place
.
I
liked
looking
over
all
of
the
trophies
and
reading
the
articles
and
seeing
the
old
pictures
.
Very
cool
stuff
.
I
got
mine
to
go
as
well
,
which
was
quickly
brought
out
to
me
.
Eating
in
looks
like
it
would
be
fun.This
is
the
best
BBQ
in
Madison
.
There
are
no
challengers
.
Comparing
this
to
Famous
Daves
is
like
comparing
a
Caribou
Burger
to
MacDonalds
.
Not
to
say
that
MacDonalds/Famous
Daves
are
necessarily
BAD
,
but
this
is
unique
,
delicious
BBQ
that
wins
best
in
Madison
year
in
and
year
out
for
a
reason
.
The
service
is
generally
solid
,
and
having
travelled
in
rural
LA
a
LOT
,
I
ca
n't
believe
anyone
who
frequents
the
southern
Miss
,
Lousiana
area
to
be
surprised
that
a
place
is
closed
on
Monday
.
The
pork
shoulder
sandwich

now

what
you

these
ribs

SO
GOOD
!!!!!!!
Famous
Dave
's
is
so
much
better
!!
I
use
to
go
here
all
the
time
when
i
was
growing
up
and
i
loved
it
,
i
do
n't
know
what
happened
but
there
food
really
went
down
the
drain
...
the
ribs
are
dry
and
black
on
the
bottom
and
the
fries
have
way
too
much
seasoning
.
I
think
Jon
needs
to
get
back
in
the
kitchen
instead
of
spending
all
his
time
at
the
bar
next
door.best

've

in
the
Carolinas
,
St.

,
and
San
Diego
-LRB-
Phil
's
-RRB-
,
and
I
can
honestly
say
that
Smoky
Jon
's
is
the
best
I
've
ever
had
!!
It
is
a
must
have
anytime
you
are
near
Madison.There
is
a
reason
this
place
has
won
awards
for
its
BBQ
.
Excellent
.
Delicious
.
Great
service.I
just
went
here
for
the
first
time
and
wow
I
ca
n't
believe
I
have
overlooked
it
for
so
many
years
!
We
tried
all
the
hot
items
,
the
beef
brisket
,
pork
shoulder
,
and
the
ribs
.
I
'd
highly
recommend
all
of
them
.
Even
if
you
are
eating
alone-you
deserve
it
.
This
is
America-Treat
yo
'
self
!
As
a
man
who
loves
attending
the
local
barbecues
I
can
say
this
place
is
BBQ
to
the
core
.
If
you
are
serious
about
barbecue
you
best
get
over
here
.
After
one
visit
,
I
already
plan
to
stop
in
or
get
takeout
whenever
I
drive
by
the
airport
.
Side
note
:
I
love
Famous
Dave
's
Barbecue
,
but
saying
Smoky
Jon
's
is
inferior
in
anyway
is
laughable
.
The
only
reason
I
will
ever
again
choose
Famous
Dave
's
over
Smoky
Jon
's
is
because
I
am
not
in
Madison
.
Secondary
note
:
you
can
pick
up
their
sauce
at
Woodman
's
to
put
on
everything.I
love
this
place
!
I
had
them
cater
my
wedding
,
had
the
Pig
up
and
Go
package
delivered
and
set
up
.
We
had
BBQ
pork
,
beef
,
and
turkey
along
with
sides
.
The
only
complaint
I
had
was
the
turkey
,
I
had
assumed
-LRB-
and
I
know
you
should
never
assume
!
-RRB-
it
would
be
fresh
,
shredded
turkey
like
the
the
pork
and
beef
,
but
it
was
the
processed
,
sliced
turkey
breast
meat
chopped
up
.
That
set
aside
,
everything
was
delivered
as
scheduled
,
the
employee
who
dropped
the
food
off
was
very
courteous
and
made
sure
to
give
us
clear
instructions
on
everything
.
We
also
visited
here
prior
to
our
wedding
and
I
shared
the
whole
rack
of
ribs
with
my
daughter
and
my
husband
had
gotten
the
rotisserie
chicken
,
the
helpings
were
huge
,
the
ribs
were
thick
with
meat
and
we
did
not
leave
hungry
!
Way
better
than
Famous
Dave
's
ribsSome
of
the
best
BBQ
I
have
ever
had
.
Found
this
place
when
I
was
looking
for
a
place
to
grab
dinner
on
a
quick
evening
flight
up
from
Chicago
.
It
's
super
close
to
the
airport
and
the
food
is
outstanding.The
ribs
were
the
best
I
have
ever
had
.
The
BBQ
sauce
is
probably
the
best
I
have
had
.
And
everything
is
very
smokey
flavored
,
which
,
for
me
,
is
a
very
good
thing
.
I
had
a
chance
to
also
try
the
chicken
-LRB-
awesome
-RRB-
and
brisket
-LRB-
decent
,
but
not
amazing
-RRB-
.
For
the
sides
,
I
got
corn
and
the
French
fries
.
This
was
surprising
for
me
but
the
fries
were
average
and
the
corn
was
unbelievable
.
I
pretty
much
assume
corn
is
corn
,
but
not
here
.
Finally
,
I
liked
the
style
of
the
place
.
It
is
a
hole
in
the
wall
without
man
tables
.
I
like
that
and
recommend
everyone
to
head
there.The
ribs
,
you
must
try
them
!
My
major
mistake
was
getting
a
1/3
slab.Very
good
food
,
would
defiantly
go
back
if
i
was
in
the
area
,
not
as
a
destination
though.Smoky
Jon
's
is
absolutely
the
best
barbeque
joint
in
Madison
,
bar-none
.
The
ribs
are
fall-off-the-bone
tender
and
cooked
to
perfection
,
but
their
brisket
is
a
real
treat
-
slightly
smokey
with
a
seasoning
that
compliments
their
barbeque
sauce
amazingly
.
Their
meats
are
served
with
your
choice
of
all
the
classic
barbeque
joint
sides
that
you
would
expect
-
my
favorites
are
the
beans
and
the
coleslaw
,
the
latter
of
which
is
rich
and
creamy
-LRB-
not
oily
and
bland
like
the
``
Creamy
Coleslaw
''
at
Brickhouse
-RRB-
.
I
'm
astounded
by
the
reviewers
who
prefer
the
likes
of
Brickhouse
BBQ
or
Famous
Dave
's
to
Smoky
Jon
's
and
can
only
assume
that
they
have
never
had
real
Kansas
City
or
Texas
barbeque
.
If
you
want
authentic
barbeque
,
nothing
beats
Smoky
Jon
's
.
Hands
down
the
BEST
BBQ
IN
MADISON
!
And
yes
,
it
was
so
good
I
had
to
use
caps
.
The
ribs
are
smothered
in
delicious
sauce
and
fall
right
off
the
bone
.
You
can
pick
your
sides
.
I
would
recommend
the
cole
slaw
and
french
fries
.
The
cole
slaw
is
nice
and
creamy
.
Mashed
potatoes
are
another
solid
pick
.
Always
get
the
ribs
.
You
will
be
disappointed
when
your
friends
are
gnawing
away
at
their
ribs
and
you
have
your
little
pulled
pork
sammie
.
The
checkered
tablecloths
and
roll
of
paper
towels
on
each
table
complete
the
experience.My
girlfriend
talked
me
into
giving
this
place
one
more
chance
so
I
said
alright
,
my
experience
this
time
was
a
huge
improvement
from
the
last
few
times
I
was
there
.
I
had
the
1/2
slab
of
ribs
with
a
double
order
of
fries
and
my
girlfriend
had
the
same
but
with
the
fried
buns
and
a
single
order
of
fries
.
The
room
was
full
of
people
when
we
first
walked
in
,
this
was
somewhat
of
a
worry
but
my
girlfriend
made
me
wait
it
out
since
she
wanted
to
eat
inside
the
restaurant
.
The
service
was
very
friendly
even
though
one
worker
was
constantly
moving
in
and
out
between
the
dining
room
and
the
kitchen
.
The
music
and
the
atmosphere
was
very
enjoyable
.
My
girlfriend
was
very
pleased
with
the
experience
and
suggested
that
we
come
back
for
a
``
date
night
''
.
I
was
very
pleased
that
this
experience
was
a
great
one
.

A
real
gem
!
I
do
n't
get
to
Madison
often
but
I
am
sure
that
if
the
next
trip
is
near
a
meal
time
I
know
where
I
'll
stop
,
Smoky
Jon
's
.
Recently
our
party
of
three
each
had
a
different
entree
,
one
that
the
host
suggested
after
learning
we
were
newby
's
.
He
guaranteed
that
we
would
love
our
choices
and
we
all
did
.
The
BBQ
pork
sandwich
was
generous
,
the
pork
was
extremely
tender
,
cooked
just
right
-LRB-
not
dried
out
or
raw
-RRB-
had
a
smokey
tang
that
makes
it
so
special
.
The
ribs
were
cooked
to
perfection
and
tender
meat
nearly
fell
off
each
bone.Their
sauce
is
mild
and
OK
but
I
was
surprised
by
the
limited
choices
in
that
area
.
They
offer
several
sides
and
the
ones
we
sampled
were
all
above
par
.
The
place
is
adorned
with
``
Best
Of
''
plaques
and
I
can
see
why.My
husband
and
I
tried
Smoky
's
for
the
first
time
a
few
weeks
ago
after
checking
out
the
new
Ale
Asylum
location
.
I
used
to
live
in
an
apartment
complex
not
far
from
Smoky
's
and
always
meant
to
try
it
and
never
did
.
I
ca
n't
believe
it
took
me
this
long
!
It
was
awesome
.
I
've
traveled
in
the
south
a
bit
so
I
think
I
can
tell
good
bbq
when
I
taste
it
-LRB-
even
though
I
'm
a
Wisconsin
native
-RRB-
and
this
was
the
real
deal
.
I
had
the
pork
dinner
-LRB-
not
sure
if
that
's
how
it
's
listed
on
the
menu
-RRB-
which
included
their
pork
shoulder
and
ribs
along
with
2
sides
-LRB-
I
had
the
corn
and
beans
-RRB-
.
It
was
A
LOT
of
food
.
Next
time
I
'll
stick
to
either
just
ribs
or
just
a
pork
sandwich
.
My
husband
had
ribs
and
beef
brisquet
.
He
could
n't
stop
raving
.
The
restaurant
is
small
and
was
full
when
we
showed
up
shortly
before
closing
time
.
A
table
opened
up
quickly
though
.
They
started
mopping
up
as
we
were
eating
-LRB-
which
the
staff
had
graciously
``
warned
''
us
about
-RRB-
but
it
did
n't
take
away
from
the
delicious
food
.
Hopefully
it
does
n't
take
as
long
as
at
did
for
my
first
visit
to
get
there
a
second
time.Restaurant
Review
Off
the
beaten
path
in
Madison
.
I
had
looked
up
this
place
before
on
tripadvisor
and
was
not
disappointed
.
The
restaurant
itself
is
super
small
and
the
parking
in
front
is
rather
limited
-LRB-
I
had
to
drive
around
the
block
twice
and
realized
that
there
was
no
parking
in
the
back
-RRB-
.
Built
as
best
BBQ
in
madison
I
was
not
disappointed
.
Fall
of
the
bone
tender
ribs
along
with
two
sides
was
the
meal
I
had
.
Get
the
sugar
fried
biscuits
and
you
wo
n't
be
disappointed
.
This
place
could
be
on
diner
and
drives
and
I
am
glad
I
found
it
one
my
own
!
Also
prices
are
super
reasonable
.
No
wonder
why
they
won
so
many
awards
for
there
food

RIBS

I
like
me
some
niceeee
slab
of
ribs
,
drizzled
in
a
tangy
,
but
slightly
sweet
BBQ
sauce
.
Smoky
Jon
's
definitely
delivered
!!
They
held
true
to
their
many
awards
-LRB-
nicely
displayed
next
to
their
register
-RRB-
and
I
was
more
than
content
once
I
finished
eating
.
The
ribs
themselves
were
just
ordinary
-
pretty
juicy
,
but
nothing
to
blow
my
mind
.
What
I
found
amazing
was
the
sauce
and
the
sides
!!!
The
corn
was
deliciousss
,
especially
all
dressed
up
in
their
special
seasoning
.
The
garlic
mashed
potatoes
tasted
just
like
the
ones
I
usually
make
at
home
,
which
are
pretttty
darn
amazing
-
if
I
should
say
so
myself
.
One
downfall
was
that
there
is
a
$
4.00
plate
splitting
fee
-LRB-
BOOOOO
!
-RRB-
.
I
really
wanted
to
try
the
1/2
slab
+
sandwich
+
sides
combo
-LRB-
only
like
2
bucks
more
than
just
1/2
slab
-RRB-
but
I
knew
I
could
n't
finish
it
by
myself
...
and
it
just
wouldnt
be
worth
it
to
pay
$
4.00
more
to
share
it
with
a
friend
.
Hmm
...
or
maybe
,
next
time
do
n't
be
as
dumb
as
me
and
say
out
loud
you
want
to
share
...
sneakily
share
it
at
the
table
!!
Anyways
,
Smoky
Jon
's
was
a
great
farewell
from
Madison
meal
for
me
,
leaving
me
nice
and
full
,
the
perfect
prep
for
a
long
flight
back
to
Los
Angeles
.
I
'd
give
it
a
solid
4
stars.Tucked
away
on
the
north
side
of
Madison
.
I
've
driven
past
it
thousands
of
times
but
went
there
yesterday
on
a
recommendation
from
a
friend
of
mine
who
knows
his
BBQ
.
Soooooo
gooooooood
.
I
had
the
pork
shoulder
sandwich
.
The
baked
beans
were
pure
flavor
country
.
I
wish
everything
I
ate
from
here
on
out
could
be
drizzled
in
that
BBQ
sauce
.
Service
was
pretty
quick
and
the
prices
were
not
bad
either
.
I
'll
be
coming
back
again.My
awesome
partner
Chuck
brought
me
takeout
the
other
night
.
Delicious
.
We
had
some
ribs
and
pulled
pork
sandwiches
.
Love
the
BBQ
sauce
.
Potato
salad
was
awesome
also
!
Wish
we
had
some
good
BBQ
in
Illinois!First
things
first
:
the
house
BBQ
sauce
is
fabulous
.
I
love
that
it
is
n't
just
the
regular
brown
house
made
goop
that
most
BBQ
joints
serve
.
You
can
actually
see
and
taste
all
the
different
spices/herbs
!!
Like
I
said
,
fabulous
.
I
went
with
the
smoked
chopped
pork
shoulder
sandwich
platter
and
two
sides
:
the
potato
salad
and
the
corn
.
If
you
-LRB-
like
me
-RRB-
choose
to
order
the
corn
to
ease
your
conscience
-LRB-
after
all
,
it
is
a
vegetable
,
right
?
-RRB-
...
do
not
be
fooled
.
The
corn
is
puuuure
buttery
goodness
.
The
potato
salad
is
also
delicious
!
Truly
,
the
perfect
complement
to
the
sandwich
.
Creamy
,
no
skin
,
no
dill
,
just
the
way
I
like
my
potato
salads
.
:9
At
$
8.45
,
the
sandwich
platters
are
very
reasonably
priced
for
the
quantity
of
food
you
get
.
The
takeout
service
is
super
quick
as
well
-
I
think
I
got
my
food
within
2-3
minutes
of
placing
my
order
.
Otherwise
,
Smoky
Jon
's
seems
like
a
fun
place
to
dine
in
as
well
-LRB-
lots
of
exposed
wooden
paneling
and
checkered
tablecloths
-RRB-
.
You
'll
probably
want
to
limit
your
party
to
a
group
of
4
or
less
though
,
the
seating
is
limited
!
Yelp
recommendations
for
what
to
order
as
a
first-timer
to
Smoky
Jon
's
are
on
point
.
I
ca
n't
wait
to
be
back
to
try
the
ribs
!!
Tip
:
their
parking
lot
is
tiny
and
shared
with
the
bar
next
door
,
so
do
n't
expect
to
find
any
open
spaces
around
lunch
or
dinner
time
.
You
'll
have
better
luck
parking
on
one
of
the
residential
streets
behind
the
joint.I
was
very
excited
as
I
entered
and
saw
all
the
plaques
and
trophies
.
I
ordered
the
ribs
and
brisket
expecting
I
'd
order
again
.
I
was
somewhat
disappointed
after
my
first
bite
.
The
sauce
was
a
bit
too
sweet
and
the
meat
kinda
dry
.
I
was
hoping
this
is
going
to
be
my
barbecue
place
in
Madison
but
I
guess
I
have
to
keep
on
looking.This
is
gon
na
be
a
difficult
review
to
write
and
I
do
n't
want
anyone
to
take
it
the
wrong
way
.
Smoky
Jons
is
good
.
I
mean
,
it
's
smoked
,
slow-cooked
,
sauce-covered
,
deliciously
unctuous
dead
pig
.
By
nature
,
it
's
delicious
and
awesome
and
good
for
your
soul
.
But
all
barbecue
is
good
.
Good
barbecue
is
great
.
Smoky
Jons
is
...
Good
.
I
'm
in
Madison
a
few
times
a
week
for
work
and
we
've
driven
by
this
place
a
hundred
times
and
every
time
said
``
We
should
stop
in
here
''
.
We
finally
did
yesterday
.
The
interior
is
nice
,
an
order
counter
,
a
few
tables
,
and
a
log-cabin
`
esque
interior
.
An
okay
place
to
eat
lunch
.
The
menu
is
pretty
expansive
,
with
a
good
selection
of
sandwiches
,
platters
,
combos
,
sausages
,
sides
,
desserts
,
etc.
.
Whatever
you
like
,
meat-wise
,
you
can
find
it
here
.
After
perusing
the
menu
,
I
decided
on
the
chopped
pork
shoulder
dinner
plate
.
I
should
say
my
family
is
from
Tennessee
and
I
grew
up
on
chopped
pork
.
I
grew
up
eating
at
shady
back-country
Tennessee
BBQ
places
with
dirt
floors
and
plank
counters
and
a
weathered
old
man
in
the
back
basting
a
pig
.
Barbecue
is
in
my
blood
.
Smoky
Jons
was
not
up
to
par
.
The
meat
was
delicious
,
but
not
smoky
at
all
.
You
literally
could
not
taste
the
pit
,
or
the
smoke
,
or
the
fire
.
The
sauce
was
good
too
,
but
soooo
sweet
.
I
guess
I
grew
up
on
a
vinegar
sauce
and
I
realize
that
sauce
is
an
intensely
regional
thing
,
but
this
was
not
what
I
enjoyed
.
The
sides
were
excellent
.
Coleslaw
is
great
.
Beans
are
perfect
.
Sugar
biscuits
are
delish
.
Honestly
,
this
is
the
best
BBQ
I
've
had
in
Madison
.
But
I
've
had
better
at
several
places
in
Milwaukee
.
And
I
've
had
better
at
countless
places
in
the
south
.
I
know
Smokey
Jon
's
is
apparently
world-renowned
for
their
BBQ
so
you
should
probably
try
it
yourself
,
and
honestly
I
'll
probably
go
back
again
.
My
favorite
though
?
No
.
A-OK
?
Yes
,
certainly.Was
driving
by
Madison
and
thought
we
'd
get
some
BBQ
.
I
had
the
spicy
chicken
,
which
was
just
a
chicken
breast
on
a
bun
,
with
sauce
on
the
side
.
That
was
it
,
not
even
a
big
chicken
breast
?
My
wife
had
the
turkey
sandwich
,
which
did
n't
appear
to
be
anything
special
either
.
It
looked
like
it
was
from
a
grocery
store
.
Kids
liked
the
burger
and
brats
.
What
I
did
n't
like
was
the
prices
,
sandwich
platters
were
$
8.45
each
and
drinks
were
$
1.99
each
.
Wasted
my
money
on
these
as
they
do
n't
give
you
a
drink
you
can
take
with
you
and
it
's
a
plastic
cup
.
What
I
did
like
was
the
sides
,
except
for
the
one
order
of
fried
biscuit
,
which
was
raw
in
the
middle
.
Threw
them
out
.
Last
,
I
've
never
been
to
a
BBQ
place
with
no
sauces
on
the
table
and
only
one
served
with
the
order
.
I
liked
the
sauce
,
but
with
all
of
the
awards
on
the
wall
,
they
should
offer
a
few
options
.
Should
have
gotten
the
pulled
pork.I
had
to
make
sure
I
did
n't
leave
any
sauce
on
my
fingers
prior
to
typing
this
.
Wait
,
did
I
?
Nope
,
clean
.
Most
likely
because
I
licked
them
clean
from
the
baller
sauce
that
is
on
this
BBQ
.
The
sauce
has
a
great
consistency
to
it
and
it
clings
nicely
to
the
meat
.
I
went
with
the
sig-other
and
between
the
two
of
us
,
we
had
the
pork
shoulder
sandwich
,
brisket
,
and
ribs
.
I
think
we
both
went
with
fries
and
the
Cole-slaw
for
our
sides
.
They
were
fine
.
Sides
are
sides
.
I
realllllllly
wish
there
would
have
been
corn
bread
.
Something
does
n't
right
within
me
if
there
is
no
corn
bread
to
accompany
BBQ
.
I
was
sad
when
I
found
out
there
was
no
cornbread
.
But
then
I
was
happy
again
the
moment
I
was
able
to
put
that
delicious
pig
in
my
mouth
.
The
ribs
were
ribs
.
The
brisket
and
the
pork
shoulder
was
where
it
was
at
for
me
,
but
really
,
I
think
you
can
slap
that
sauce
on
cardboard
and
it
would
be
delicious
.
I
'm
a
west-sider
so
coming
out
here
is
a
haul
.
A
worth
while
haul
.
Be
prepared
to
wait
though
;
the
dining
room
is
small
.
They
did
get
out
food
out
to
us
really
quickly
,
but
if
we
would
have
come
15
minutes
later
we
would
have
had
to
wait
in
a
long
line
to
place
our
order
,
and
then
would
have
had
no
where
to
sit
.
Oh
,
and
if
I
was
n't
such
a
bottomless
pit
,
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
leftovers
as
the
portions
are
plentiful
.
I
definitely
did
not
leave
hungry.Delicious
BBQ
from
friendly
,
saucy
folk
.
The
brisket
was
as
good
as
any
I
've
had
in
Texas
and
the
sauce
was
sweet
,
spicy
and
with
a
little
heat
.
They
also
offer
a
number
of
tempting
sides
-LRB-
you
get
2
with
most
everything
on
the
menu
-RRB-
including
a
great
corn
,
skin
on
fries
,
coleslaw
,
beans
and
deep
fried
biscuits
that
look
and
taste
like
the
beignets
from
New
Orleans
.
Parking
is
limited
so
you
may
need
to
park
a
block
away
in
the
neighborhood
and
just
walk
over
the
restaurant
.
Located
near
the
Oscar
Mayer
factory
on
Packer
road
.
Definitely
worth
a
visit
.
We
will
definitely
be
back
when
we
head
back
to
Madison
in
the
fall.When
thinking
BBQ
you
do
not
think
of
Madison
,
WI
.
This
is
the
one
exception
to
that
rule
.
The
food
here
is
by
hands
down
the
best
BBQ
in
Southern
Wisconsin
,
there
is
nothing
on
the
menu
that
you
can
go
wrong
with
.
What
is
even
better
the
award
winning
sauce
does
not
mask
or
cover
bad
meat
but
creates
an
even
better
experience
.
Seating
is
limited
and
parking
is
even
more
so
,
you
can
park
on
the
side
road
-LRB-
Manley
St
-RRB-
off
of
Packers
Ave.I
've
eaten
at
Smoky
Jon
's
a
couple
of
times
over
the
last
few
years
.
Their
BBQ
sauce
is
fantastic
,
their
chili
is
great
-LRB-
when
in
season
-RRB-
,
and
their
beans
are
delicious
.
Unfortunately
I
find
their
meat
to
be
kind
of
bland
,
if
very
tender
--
this
has
been
consistent
across
all
of
my
visits
,
trying
ribs
,
brisket
,
and
pulled
pork
.
Policies
regarding
customers
can
be
strange
.
On
our
latest
visit
,
my
girlfriend
and
I
were
going
to
be
charged
a
$
4
plate
splitting
fee
for
sharing
a
meal
at
lunch
...
There
was
no
combination
of
additional
sides
that
would
abate
this
fee
,
only
the
purchase
of
a
second
full
meal
.
We
opted
for
take-out
.
ok
food
but
most
of
it
is
frozen
or
canned
and
the
ribs
gave
me
the
shits.I
gave
myself
an
hour
to
eat
dining
in
before
I
have
to
catch
a
plane
.
I
ordered
.
I
waited
45
minutes
.
It
seemed
busy
and
I
was
stupid
enough
to
keep
waiting
even
though
I
see
the
guy
who
ordered
before
me
get
his
and
leave
20
minutes
in
.
I
did
n't
have
anymore
time
and
asked
them
to
check
my
order
.
Nope
,
the
ticket
was
lost
.
I
was
so
hungry
and
so
sad
that
I
could
n't
get
any
ribs
.
In
the
state
of
chaos
that
the
kitchen
and
staff
was
in
,
there
was
no
way
they
were
gon
na
rush
the
order
out
in
time
even
for
to-go
.
I
had
to
get
a
refund
and
speed
to
the
airport
.
For
what
it
's
worth
I
do
n't
think
the
1
woman
on
wait
staff
was
to
blame
.
The
owner
really
threw
her
under
the
bus
by
understaffing
on
a
busy
night
.
There
's
so
many
people
,
so
many
orders
.
There
was
another
girl
just
taking
orders
.
Just
standing
and
waiting
,
while
the
other
woman
ran
back
and
forth
with
bags
and
bags
of
food
.
What
kind
of
restaurant
is
this
?
It
's
such
a
weird
sight
in
a
restaurant
:
one
girl
running
another
girl
standing
.
But
at
least
I
know
she
put
my
ticket
into
the
kitchen
.
Someone
fucked
up
in
the
kitchen
;
someone
threw
away
my
ticket
.
I
will
not
be
coming
back
and
will
not
be
sending
any
friends
and
family
here
either
.
For
all
the
awards
the
place
gets
and
all
its
years
of
being
in
business
,
I
wish
it
just
was
n't
so
amateur
at
being
a
restaurant.My
precious
little
brother
has
been
going
on
about
Smoky
Jon
's
for
some
time
now
and
we
finally
made
a
trip
that
allowed
us
to
head
on
into
this
fabulous
establishment
!
I
could
n't
quite
decide
what
I
wanted
so
I
went
with
my
usual
BBQ
joint
pick
-
pork
sandwich
!
I
opted
for
the
potato
salad
and
beans
on
the
side
.
My
entire
plate
of
food
was
delicious
and
I
'd
absolutely
come
back
again
.
The
only
thing
I
did
n't
love
was
my
husbands
chopped
beef
sandwich
-
but
,
lucky
for
me
,
I
went
with
my
ol'
bbq
joint
standby
;
-RRB-
For
Madison
,
this
BBQ
is
pretty
spectacular
.
Anywhere
else
and
I
'd
give
it
4
stars
but
,
considering
the
location
,
it
's
damn
good
and
deserving
of
5
stars
.
The
food
's
good
,
the
staff
is
friendly
,
and
-LRB-
for
freshly-made
BBQ
-RRB-
the
service
is
usually
quick.So
...
this
is
the
kind
of
food
that
will
kill
you
.
So
there
's
that
.
But
that
being
said
,
this
is
the
best
way
I
can
think
of
to
take
in
food
with
absolutely
no
nutritional
value
.
The
ribs
are
sweet
sticky
tender
meat
bars
.
The
sides
are
sweet
sticky
flavor
bombs
of
flavor
.
The
rolls
are
airy
buttery
balls
of
carbohydrates
.
You
should
get
extra
napkins
.
I
think
this
place
is
best
for
carryout
.
You
can
sit
and
eat
-
there
are
a
handful
of
tables
,
but
then
there
are
also
bullet
holes
in
the
windows
.
Since
it
's
Madison
,
I
'm
assuming
someone
put
them
there
for
show
,
but
definitely
with
a
real
gun
,
so
anyway
I
'd
rather
eat
at
home
.
Also
,
if
you
've
been
doing
the
House
of
Cards
thing
and
want
that
BBQ
experience
but
you
do
n't
live
in
the
south
,
this
is
the
closest
you
are
going
to
get
.
So
,
check
it
out
Madison
,
it
's
a
little
bit
different
but
that
does
n't
mean
it
is
n't
fabulous!Delicious
BBQ
,
especially
for
a
place
in
WI
.
This
place
is
known
for
its
ribs
,
and
it
deserves
the
praise
it
gets
for
them
.
There
are
some
other
hits
,
and
some
less
than
stellar
items
on
the
menu
.
We
got
the
half
slab
and
jumbo
1/2
chicken
dinner
to
share
,
which
was
huge
!
Big
portions
,
but
the
chicken
was
really
dry
.
The
ribs
were
amazing
.
We
also
ordered
some
beef
brisket
,
which
is
a
much
smaller
portion
than
the
ribs
and
chicken
.
If
you
're
not
a
fan
of
fatty
brisket
-LRB-
like
me
-RRB-
than
you
'll
be
quite
happy
with
their
brisket
.
No
awkward
moments
of
biting
into
a
string
of
fat
and
trying
to
spit
it
out
in
front
of
your
date
.
The
sides
,
overall
,
could
be
better
.
But
lets
be
honest
,
you
're
not
here
for
the
sides
.
If
you
do
n't
want
to
order
any
sides
you
'll
save
about
a
buck
,
but
it
's
worth
it
to
venture
out
and
try
them
.
The
baked
beans
were
iffy
.
I
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
them
via
Yelp
,
but
ours
were
grey-ish
and
tasted
off
.
The
potato
salad
is
definitely
full
fat
and
more
mayo
based
.
It
's
a
nice
and
cool
way
to
offset
the
kick
of
BBQ
.
The
french
fries
are
more
run-of-the-mill
than
anything
else
here
.
We
also
tried
the
fried
biscuits
after
seeing
so
many
people
rave
about
them
.
Maybe
I
had
too
high
of
expectations
?
They
were
good
,
they
tasted
a
bit
like
carnival
food
,
but
they
did
n't
garner
a
``
Oh
my
,
I
'd
eat
these
every
day
if
I
could
''
opinion
like
the
ribs
did
.
The
sauce
here
is
unlike
any
other
BBQ
sauce
I
've
ever
had
.
It
's
a
bit
chunky
and
sweeter
than
usual
but
has
a
nice
kick
at
the
end
.
Definitely
go
for
the
ribs
.
The
brisket
is
good
.
Chicken
could
be
better
.
The
sides
are
hit
or
miss
.
We
got
take-out
since
the
seating
is
limited
.
It
's
also
pretty
loud
there
,
lots
of
people
talking
and
loud
music
.
I
'd
definitely
recommend
this
place!Great
BBQ
!
Excellent
customer
service
.
Place
is
really
busy
at
lunch
time
so
prepare
to
stand
in
line.Awesome
BBQ
!
Great
price
for
great
food
!
Best
in
Madison
.
I
highly
recommend
the
garlic
mashed
potatoes
and
sugar
fried
biscuits
!
I
got
the
pulled
pork
and
loved
the
sauce
.
Sauce
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
great
balance
of
hers
and
spices
.
Service
was
LIGHTNING
fast
and
extremely
friendly
.
I
wish
we
ha
this
kind
of
place
down
in
Chicago!Thumbs
up
to
an
8.95
sandwich
platter
that
includes
two
sides
and
fills
me
up
like
no
other
.
Seriously
.
The
amount
of
food
.
The
quality
.
That
sauce
!
Go
grab
yourself
a
brisket
sammie
with
corn
and
fries
.
You
'll
thank
me
tomorrow.The
ribs
are
the
best
BBQ
in
Madison
by
far
and
have
never
disappointed
in
many
visits
.
The
rest
of
the
menu
is
inconsequential
--
trust
me
,
just
get
the
ribs.Damn
good
barbeque
.
Possibly
the
best
I
've
had
in
Madison
if
I
'm
looking
for
something
rich
that
will
definitely
fill
you
up
and
leave
you
feeling
guilty
.
The
ribs
are
top
notch
and
the
sauce
is
just
right
.
Meat
falls
right
off
the
bone
and
the
sides
are
adequate
.
Just
wish
they
had
a
spicy
variant
of
some
of
their
items
.
The
interior
goes
great
with
the
food
;
lots
of
vintage
Americana
items
and
newspaper
cutouts
of
stunning
reviews
of
the
food
.
The
service
is
very
friendly
,
always
willing
to
help
you
make
up
your
mind
about
menu
choices
.
The
wait
is
n't
very
long
for
an
entrée
and
that
's
valuable
.
A
friend
I
came
with
had
the
pulled
pork
burger
and
praised
it
greatly
.
The
food
really
lives
up
to
its
record-setting
reputation
.
I
'll
be
back
in
moderation
so
as
not
to
clog
my
pipes
up.Very
quaint
little
place
.
Seats
24
people
inside
so
if
you
're
having
a
party
,
it
's
best
to
get
it
to
go
.
I
had
the
1/2
rack
of
Ribs
platter
which
came
with
Garlic
Mashed
Potatoes
and
a
side
salad
.
The
platter
was
served
with
a
roll
as
well
.
The
size
of
the
side
salad
was
great
and
it
even
had
different
lettuce
types
and
carrot
matchsticks
.
The
Garlic
Mashed
was
very
tasty
but
there
was
n't
a
lot
-
perhaps
a
small
ice
cream
scoop
-LRB-
like
,
tiny
child
size
-RRB-
.
That
's
great
for
portion
control
!
The
ribs
were
very
tender
and
the
sauce
was
a
sweet
,
fruity
vinegary
Barbeque
.
I
found
it
overwhelming
with
a
small
bite
but
then
as
I
noshed
on
,
it
was
very
good
.
My
husband
got
the
1/2
chicken
and
it
was
fantastic
!
The
chicken
was
moist
there
was
a
touch
of
char
and
the
sauce
was
quite
elegant
with
the
meat
.
The
creamy
coleslaw
was
quite
tasty
,
in
fact
,
if
you
're
a
person
who
loved
your
mom
's
creamy
coleslaw
from
the
1960
's
-LRB-
it
was
actually
based
off
a
Miracle
Whip
recipe
-RRB-
then
this
is
the
one
for
you
.
Next
time
I
return
,
I
'm
trying
a
sandwich
,
with
cole
slaw
and
the
biscuits
-LRB-
``
tastes
like
a
funnel
cake
''
says
the
server
-RRB-
.
NOTE
:
If
you
share
a
plate
there
is
a
$
4
surcharge.Checked
this
out
based
on
the
reviews
.
Good
selection
,
a
little
bit
more
pricey
than
some
others
.
Very
good
ribs
.
Served
with
a
lot
of
sauce
which
I
wiped
off
a
bit
to
find
the
ribs
with
a
pleasantly
smoky
taste
.
Very
tender
.
Service
was
mediocre
,
waitress
was
n't
exactly
rude
but
was
n't
very
friendly
either
.
Not
sure
about
the
neighborhood
,
I
have
n't
had
to
show
an
id
to
use
a
credit
card
in
this
area
before
.
I
'd
go
5
star
but
for
the
service
,
but
maybe
I
hit
them
on
a
bad
day.This
was
our
first
time
trying
Smokey
Jons
.
It
is
a
new
favorite
for
sure
.
The
space
was
small
but
cozy
,
and
the
food
definitely
deserves
best
in
Madison
-LRB-
or
the
universe
-RRB-
.
Patanne
-LRB-
the
lovely
lady
who
took
our
order
-RRB-
was
friendly
and
made
us
feel
right
at
home
.
We
will
be
back.Best
BBQ
in
Madison
!
Ribs
are
amazing
,
and
the
fried
sweet
rolls
melt
in
your
mouth
.
They
basically
the
best
beignets
I
have
ever
had
.
I
stop
here
almost
every
time
on
my
way
to
the
airport.WwoOOW
!
It
is
really
that
good
here
!
If
u
do
n't
stop
u
are
missing
out
BIG
TIME
!
Great
food!I
had
lunch
at
Smoky
Jon
's
on
my
first
day
in
Madison
.
I
had
seen
stellar
reviews
,
claiming
it
was
the
best
BBQ
in
Madison
.
Unfortunately
,
I
was
disappointed
.
I
ordered
the
brisket
sandwich
meal
with
fries
and
a
side
salad
.
The
fries
were
the
best
thing
on
the
plate
-LRB-
maybe
it
's
because
I
do
n't
have
fries
very
often
-RRB-
,
but
these
fries
were
just
okay
.
The
salad
was
just
bagged
romaine
lettuce
with
dressing
in
a
packet
.
I
know
that
brisket
can
be
a
little
fatty
,
but
my
brisket
was
almost
as
much
fat
as
meat
.
The
brisket
had
soaked
through
the
bottom
side
of
my
bun
,
so
I
ate
it
-
or
half
of
it
-
with
a
fork
.
I
assume
Smoky
Jon
's
had
an
off-day
when
I
was
there
because
they
really
get
great
user
reviews.Four
stars
for
the
normal
quality
.
Last
night
though
got
take
out
and
the
order
was
wrong
-
too
far
to
drive
back
.
The
pork
and
the
ribs
were
WAY
over
cooked
-
or
better
said
kept
hot
way
too
long
.
The
pork
was
mushy
and
the
ribs
dry
and
hard
.
I
know
waste
in
the
restaurant
biz
is
a
killer
but
I
have
heard
this
from
a
couple
of
people
now
and
am
hoping
you
get
back
to
your
usual
quality
control
.
The
chicken
though
was
as
perfect
as
ever
.
Do
n't
let
the
quality
slip!I
've
lived
in
Madison
for
almost
3
years
and
have
stupidly
spent
most
of
that
time
heading
to
Brickhouse
BBQ
whenever
the
porky
craving
strikes
.
No
longer
!
This
place
is
the
real
deal
.
I
ca
n't
speak
to
the
entire
menu
because
I
order
the
same
thing
every
time
I
'm
there
:
pulled
pork
sandwich
,
garlic
mashed
potatoes
,
biscuits
.
The
mashed
potatoes
are
stupid
good
,
like
,
eyes-roll-in-the-back-of-your-head-with-the-first-bite
good
.
They
give
you
a
little
cup
,
which
is
good
for
me
because
I
could
eat
a
whole
barrel
of
the
stuff
.
BBQ
sauce
has
a
bit
of
a
kick
,
but
is
n't
unbearably
spicy
.
On
my
last
visit
,
I
saw
they
added
mac
and
cheese
to
the
menu
-LRB-
uuhhhhhh
yummmm
-RRB-
but
I
do
n't
know
if
I
can
bear
to
part
with
one
of
my
other
sides
to
try
it
.
I
'll
just
have
to
make
my
boyfriend
order
double
biscuits
instead.Awesome
!!
Ca
n't
believe
i
drove
by
it
a
million
times
and
never
went
.
Best
ribs
!!
The
best
!
They
have
been
around
a
long
time
and
have
thrived
when
other
rib
places
come
and
go
.
I
make
the
long
trip
across
town
when
I
need
a
half-slab
.
Ever
since
moving
out
to
Milwaukee
I
've
had
a
craving
for
this
place
.
I
wish
I
could
get
back
to
Madison
a
little
bit
more
often
just
to
make
another
trip
to
Smoky
Jon
's
.
Walking
in
it
's
clear
what
your
in
for
.
Jon
has
rib
credentials
!
The
walls
are
covered
in
awards
and
certificates
the
guy
has
won
.
Best
sauce
,
best
ribs
,
best
this
,
best
that
.
You
do
n't
get
the
awards
this
place
has
without
knowing
what
you
're
doing
.
I
almost
always
get
the
ribs
-LRB-
because
how
can
you
not
?
-RRB-
.
The
sauce
has
just
enough
heat
to
really
compliment
the
ribs
.
I
've
tried
a
few
of
the
sandwiches
,
but
I
always
end
up
coming
back
to
the
ribs
because
that
's
where
this
place
really
shines
.
The
sides
are
also
very
good
.
The
potato
salad
and
coleslaw
are
my
favorites
.
I
'm
also
big
fan
of
the
BBQ
Baked
Beans
.
The
french
fries
are
good
enough
if
you
get
takeout
from
Smoky
's
-LRB-
just
because
they
travel
a
bit
better
than
something
like
cole
slaw
-RRB-
,
but
with
so
much
other
great
stuff
to
try
you
are
really
ripping
yourself
off
if
you
stick
to
them
.
This
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
places
in
Madtown.This
has
been
on
my
radar
for
a
while
.
See
the
pictures
.
First
off
this
is
important
,
when
you
walk
in
you
smell
smoke
so
I
knew
it
was
going
to
be
good
.
Very
woody
and
tons
of
awards
and
plaques
etc.
.
Thy
were
not
as
smokey
as
I
wanted
and
boldly
came
sauced
.
They
were
fall
off
the
bone
and
had
that
pink
smoke
ring
on
the
inside
.
I
had
the
half
rack
with
beans
and
potato
salad
.
The
ribs
were
pretty
good
and
I
really
liked
the
sauce
and
bought
a
bottle
.
The
beans
were
nothing
special
and
the
potato
salad
was
average
.
The
beans
would
be
great
if
they
were
smoked
and
hade
little
bits
of
meat
in
them
.
Sides
are
usually
not
the
star
and
this
was
the
case
.
The
ribs
are
worth
going
for
,
my
friends
said
this
was
there
new
BBQ
place
for
them
and
they
will
be
black
.
One
person
said
the
brisket
sandwich
was
really
good
.
Over
all
this
is
a
solid
BBQ
rib
place
.
Two
thumbs
upWhen
I
only
ordered
sandwiches
I
was
doing
it
all
wrong
.
The
way
to
go
is
to
get
a
half
chicken
and
the
1/3
slab
combo
with
brisket
.
Insane
amount
of
food
?
Yes
.
Worth
getting
to
try
all
the
best
parts
of
the
menu
?
Yes!Great
rub
on
the
ribs
.
Little
to
spicy
sauce
but
,
it
was
tasty
.
Mac
'n
cheese
is
ok
.
Pork
and
brisket
sandwichs
are
AWESOME
.
Definitely
coming
back
!!!
This
place
makes
me
miss
when
I
used
to
live
down
in
Georgia
...
but
only
for
the
phenomenal
BBQ
.
Seriously
though
,
I
have
n't
found
a
place
with
authentic
Southern
BBQ
this
north
of
the
Mason-Dixie
Line
...
until
NOW
!
For
lunch
,
try
the
sandwich
platter
.
There
's
a
serious
amount
of
food
and
it
will
fill
you
up
.
Not
enough
you
say
?
Ok
,
then
go
for
the
half-chicken
with
the
brisket
.
It
's
enough
to
fill
up
half
the
Confederate
army
!
The
sauces
are
full
of
flavor
and
delicious
!
It
may
look
like
a
hole-in-the-wall
but
it
has
5-star
food!Well
,
I
read
the
reviews
and
thought
this
would
be
impressive
.
Nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
!
The
dude
at
the
counter
appeared
annoyed
that
we
interrupted
him
yesterday
,
the
portions
on
the
beans
and
potato
salad
were
miniscule
-LRB-
I
was
unaware
that
you
could
even
serve
beans
and
potato
salad
in
a
cup
designed
for
condiments
,
but
lo
and
behold
,
here
it
was
--
3
bites
later
and
both
were
history
-RRB-
.
We
had
the
pulled
pork
sandwiches
,
and
I
make
better
at
home
.
The
bbq
sauce
was
good
,
but
that
was
about
it
.
We
do
n't
plan
on
coming
back
ever
,
especially
not
for
$
23.00
for
2
people
...
But
,
we
did
fill
up
on
gelato
at
the
mall
about
20
minutes
later
as
we
were
still
hungry
when
we
left
.
I
'm
wondering
where
in
the
heck
the
other
folks
on
here
ate
,
because
this
was
n't
at
all
the
same
experience
they
had.A
few
of
us
hit
Smoky
Jon
's
for
lunch
today
.
It
was
insisted
that
it
's
the
best
BBQ
in
Madison
,
so
I
was
game
to
try
it
.
The
place
has
character
-
you
order
at
a
window
and
go
take
a
seat
.
They
bring
the
food
out
to
you
.
Nothing
fancy
-
paper
plates
,
styrofoam
cups
,
etc.
.
I
got
a
chopped
smoked
pork
sandwich
with
coleslaw
and
french
fries
.
I
snarfed
a
fry
to
start
.
Not
very
hot
...
``
warm
''
,
I
'd
say
.
But
tasty
-
salty
.
Could
have
been
better
if
fresh
,
but
they
'll
do
.
The
coleslaw
was
the
creamiest
I
've
ever
had
.
The
flavor
was
n't
strong
,
but
it
was
okay
.
Could
have
used
a
little
salt
and
pepper
-
neither
to
be
found
.
The
pork
was
tasty
-
definitely
smokey
.
The
side
of
sauce
made
it
,
however
.
Sweet
,
tangy
,
spicy
.
While
I
was
eating
it
,
I
thought
``
yeah
,
it
's
okay
-
but
I
would
n't
rave
about
it
''
.
Later
,
however
,
thinking
back
on
the
meal
,
I
thought
,
``
you
know
,
that
was
REALLY
good
!
''
While
it
does
n't
best
the
BBQ
I
've
had
in
Memphis
,
it
certainly
cuts
itself
from
the
same
cloth
.
I
'd
have
it
again
.
I
think
my
meal
was
around
$
9
-LRB-
no
drink
-
had
a
water
-RRB-
.
I
was
full
,
and
content
.
Mission
accomplished
!
My
coworker
had
some
ribs
,
and
they
looked
very
good
-
not
too
fatty
,
cooked
well
.
I
would
like
to
go
back
and
try
them
sometime
!
Tip
:
Limited
seating
,
so
show
up
early
-LRB-
or
late
!
-RRB-
This
local
BBQ
icon
was
on
our
list
of
dining
destinations
when
Santi
and
I
were
planning
our
trip
to
Madison
.
Located
nearby
the
airport
,
the
well-lit
,
wooded
interior
starts
with
a
pathway
that
leads
to
the
large
overhead
menu
,
the
ordering
counter
,
and
the
dining
area
.
Adding
to
the
décor
are
the
statewide
accolades
all
around
the
walls
.
On
this
evening
,
the
casual
atmosphere
happened
to
be
unexpectedly
subdued
,
quite
unlike
the
other
BBQ
restaurants
I
've
visited
.
We
shared
a
Combination
Meal
-LRB-
$
17.75
-RRB-
that
included
our
choice
of
1/3
Slab
,
Smoked
Pork
Shoulder
Sandwich
,
and
extra
serving
of
smoked
pork
shoulder
,
Cole
Slaw
,
and
BBQ
Baked
Beans
.
The
Slab/Pork
Ribs
were
smoky
,
tender
,
and
the
meat
easily
peeled
off
the
bones
.
There
was
an
excellent
hint
of
smoke
to
deepen
its
flavor
,
and
that
was
further
enhanced
by
the
BBQ
sauce
to
provide
a
sweet
higher
note
,
strong
black
peppery
secondary
,
and
anchored
by
a
noticeable
spicy
kick
that
reverberates
with
good
hops
.
For
the
price
,
there
was
n't
enough
meat
on
the
ribs
,
but
the
flavors
were
still
sensational
.
The
dinner
roll
that
this
dish
came
with
was
sweet
,
soft
,
and
spongy
.
I
loved
it
.
The
Pork
Shoulder
Sandwich
was
excellent
as
well
.
The
pork
shoulders
were
tender
without
one
single
dry
spot
--
perfectly
executed
and
delicious
without
the
BBQ
sauce
.
The
meat
was
flavorful
and
deepened
by
its
smoky
flavor
that
coupled
perfectly
with
the
well-rounded
,
full-bodied
spicy
BBQ
sauce
.
I
absolutely
loved
it
except
for
the
buns
that
turned
out
flaky
with
hollow
spots
and
lacking
flavor
.
We
finished
the
meat
without
getting
into
the
buns
very
much
.
This
sandwich
could
have
been
so
much
better
with
a
bun
of
higher
quality
.
The
BBQ
Baked
Beans
were
smooth
,
sweet
,
and
delicious
.
The
Slaw
on
the
other
hand
was
too
wet
with
a
weak
texture
.
Compared
to
other
BBQ
joints
,
their
sides
could
use
more
varieties
such
as
green
beans
,
collard
greens
,
yam
and
other
possibilities
to
complement
this
resounding
BBQ
.
They
also
have
two
sauces
,
and
I
wished
we
had
the
option
of
trying
both
at
the
table
.
Service
was
impatient
at
first
,
as
we
were
initially
tentative
and
indecisive
about
our
choices
.
I
wished
the
server
could
have
been
much
more
educational
with
their
strengths
and
limitations
to
help
us
make
the
right
decisions
on
this
very
first
visit
.
However
,
she
later
became
much
more
warm
,
accessible
,
attentive
,
and
helpful
towards
the
middle
and
end
of
the
meal
.
Price-wise
,
their
items
were
pricy
with
the
portions
we
received
.
I
'd
be
very
interested
in
coming
back
to
try
their
Beef
Briskets
and
Chicken
Dinner.After
surviving
my
first
tornado
scare
in
Madison
,
Wisconsin
,
my
partner
in
crime
,
Daniel
L.
and
I
ventured
out
to
this
well
known
local
BBQ
hangout
for
some
good
old
smoky
ribs
and
all
the
fixings
.
With
the
Midwest
reputation
of
having
some
of
the
finest
meats
,
it
was
a
no
brainer
to
order
the
1/3
slab
BBQ
smoked
ribs
and
pork
shoulder
sandwich
combination
dinner
-LRB-
$
14.75
-RRB-
.
The
staff
mentioned
the
pork
shoulder
and
the
beef
brisket
were
the
top
sellers
besides
the
ribs
.
The
pork
shoulder
was
pigilicious
!
The
shredded
meat
was
perfectly
seasoned
with
the
rub
and
then
hickory
smoked
which
gave
its
own
taste
without
the
addition
of
the
BBQ
sauce
.
It
also
impressed
me
because
there
were
was
no
sign
of
grease
on
the
pork
.
The
bun
was
a
standard
bread
bun
compared
to
the
sweet
roll
which
accompanied
the
dinner
combination
.
We
took
the
recommendation
of
the
staff
and
ordered
the
extra
meat
-LRB-
additional
5
ounces
for
$
3
-RRB-
since
were
feeling
extra
carnivorous
!
The
BBQ
pork
ribs
came
with
five
succulent
ribs
with
the
meat
just
waiting
to
fall
off
the
bone
.
Each
bite
had
a
generous
coating
of
their
famous
award
winning
BBQ
sauce
.
Our
dinner
combination
came
with
two
choices
of
side
orders
which
we
picked
the
baked
beans
and
cole
slaw
.
Both
were
served
in
a
small
styrofoam
cups
along
with
the
BBQ
sauce
.
It
's
easy
to
see
why
the
BBQ
sauce
won
numerous
award
because
of
it
's
rich
,
sweet
and
peppery
flavor
.
I
'm
not
a
fan
of
cole
slaw
but
this
one
exceed
my
expectations
with
its
creaminess
and
was
extra
cold
.
The
baked
beans
maintained
a
firm
texture
and
should
be
ordered
with
any
meal
because
the
sauce
was
so
addictive
.
The
cabin
style
interior
holds
11
tables
and
is
very
close
to
the
Madison
airport
.
The
actual
BBQ
pit
is
located
a
few
miles
away
from
the
restaurant
.
So
grab
your
dental
floss
and
wet
naps
and
eat
some
authentic
BBQ
at
Smoky
Jon
's
!
This
was
the
second
time
I
've
eaten
here
.
The
first
time
was
a
few
years
ago
and
I
had
the
brisket
and
ribs
.
The
ribs
were
really
good
and
the
brisket
was
decent
.
It
was
the
flat
and
was
cut
thin
,
probably
because
it
was
a
touch
dry
.
It
had
a
good
flavor
though
.
The
second
time
was
this
month
-LRB-
July
2014
-RRB-
and
I
got
the
brisket
platter
with
two
sides
.
The
baked
beans
were
decent
.
Nothing
special
,
but
tasted
fine
.
The
Mac-n-cheese
was
pretty
good
.
There
was
a
lot
of
cheese
sauce
in
relation
to
macaroni
.
I
like
a
little
crunch
to
my
mac
and
cheese
,
but
this
was
thick
and
creamy
,
which
is
OK
.
The
brisket
was
great
.
It
was
n't
cut
paper
thin
,
had
a
nice
smoke
ring
and
was
easily
pulled
apart
with
fingers
.
In
other
words
it
was
tender
and
not
dry
at
all
.
Much
better
than
the
first
time
I
visited
.
My
only
complaint
would
be
they
put
sauce
on
the
brisket
.
I
prefer
sauce
on
the
side
because
good
barbeque
does
n't
need
sauce
and
this
brisket
did
n't
need
sauce.Jon
's
place
is
good
quality
BBQ
and
I
can
see
why
it
gets
the
following
,
but
I
would
agree
with
a
few
that
have
said
it
's
not
the
best
they
have
had
.
I
how
ever
can
see
why
many
have
said
it
's
great
.
Madison
lacks
good
BBQ
so
it
was
refreshing
to
see
a
place
putting
out
nice
Ribs
,
Brisket
,
Sausage
and
Chicken
.
I
especially
liked
the
ribs
,
but
found
the
sauce
a
little
spicy
for
the
Brisket
.
I
'd
like
to
try
a
sweeter
sauce
on
the
Brisket
sandwich
,
but
their
original
sauce
pairs
perfectly
with
the
ribs
.
I
had
three
meats
and
all
were
perfectly
cooked
.
Part
of
my
giving
4
stars
for
the
size
of
there
sides
which
are
served
in
condiment
cups
.
Jon
,
please
admit
your
side
cups
are
small
...
please
.
I
will
be
back
very
soon
for
the
Ribs
...
see
you
soon.I
normally
do
not
like
to
review
fast
food
establishments
,
because
they
are
normally
large
chains
that
have
about
the
same
stuff
all
over
.
Fazoli
's
is
a
little
different
.
First
it
is
Italian
and
not
the
normal
burger
or
chicken
place
.
The
food
is
good
,
not
a
great
Italian
meal
that
you
would
find
in
Italy
,
but
good
and
filling
.
It
is
served
hot
and
fresh
.
The
breadsticks
are
above
average
and
you
get
as
many
as
you
want
.
If
you
want
fast
food
,
but
not
the
normal
,
give
Fazoli
's
a
try.If
you
want
``
Italian
food
''
that
has
the
look
and
feel
of
a
Stouffer
's
t.v.
dinner
,
Fazoli
's
gets
it
right
.
Actually
,
I
take
that
back
.
If
you
are
heating
up
a
t.v.
dinner
,
at
least
you
are
guaranteed
it
will
be
warm.Very
frustrating
experience
.
Our
order
was
very
simple
but
the
cashier
could
n't
get
it
right
.
While
waiting
for
our
food
I
watched
the
beleaguered
manager
apologizing
to
every
table
.
Every
customer
had
a
problem
with
their
food
or
order
.
We
waited
twenty
minutes
for
our
food
and
decided
to
leave
.
I
have
never
experienced
more
incompetence
.
Never
again
...
Food
is
okay
for
a
fast
food
Italian
restaurant
.
They
bring
you
our
food
and
they
clean
it
too
;
it
's
like
they
are
trying
to
convert
to
an
actual
restaurant
with
waiters
and
bus
boys
.
The
unlimited
breadsticks
are
for
dine-ins
only
.
Have
only
had
one
bad
service
where
they
took
a
while
for
my
one
meal
but
they
did
handle
it
well
by
apologizing
and
giving
me
a
coupon
for
a
free
meal
next
time.Awesome
service
and
the
food
is
great
!
The
alfredo
is
a
bit
lighter
than
Olive
Garden
which
I
personally
like
and
the
breadsticks
are
to
DIE
FOR
.
Also
if
you
save
your
receipt
there
is
a
website
to
fill
in
a
survey
and
you
get
a
free
spaghetti/sauce
entree
-LRB-
regular
sized
which
is
good
sized
-RRB-
for
the
price
of
a
drink
-LRB-
turns
out
to
be
less
than
$
2
-RRB-
!
This
is
a
great
deal
because
even
if
you
do
this
they
give
you
another
receipt
and
you
can
keep
getting
the
deal
.
Also
if
you
go
before
3
they
have
a
good
lunch
special
which
is
2 1/2
portions
of
pasta/lasagna
and
a
drink
for
$
5
!
Great
fast
restaurant
and
the
manager
is
phenomenal!I
bought
a
spaghetti
dinner
and
it
was
really
good
food
.
Hot
,
tasted
good
,
and
decent
sized
serving
for
the
price
.
I
liked
that
I
got
my
food
quickly
and
the
staff
was
friendly
.
There
is
a
drive-thru
.
For
my
money
this
is
the
best
place
in
Madison
to
get
a
gyro
.
The
place
is
a
little
shady
and
has
n't
been
updated
since
it
was
built
,
but
you
'll
get
a
lot
of
good
food
for
not
a
lot
of
cash
and
you
will
get
it
with
a
smile
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
.
The
gyros
are
essentially
the
same
as
Parthenon
and
,
for
that
matter
,
99
%
of
all
gyro
places
.
I
go
with
the
gyro
dinner
,
however
,
which
is
double
the
meat
and
is
absolutely
glorious
in
all
of
its
artery
clogging
goodness
.
I
've
never
tried
any
of
their
other
items
,
but
they
have
your
usual
deep
fried
fare
if
you
are
so
inclined
.
Also
,
the
owner
always
seems
to
be
there
and
in
a
friendly
mood
as
opposed
to
the
dour
S.O.B.s
downtown.After
reading
other
Yelp
reviews
,
I
decided
to
try
Dimitri
's
,
unfortunately
.
The
gyro
meat
was
bland
...
gyros
are
not
meant
to
be
BLAND
!
We
also
tried
the
so-called
spinach
pie
.
Again
,
it
's
pretty
bland
and
seems
like
it
came
from
a
grocery
store
freezer
.
It
is
n't
actually
*
bad
*
...
it
's
just
not
*
good
*
...
so
I
gave
it
two
stars
.
There
is
much
better
food
in
Madison
.
If
you
want
gyros
,
go
to
the
Parthenon
.
If
you
want
spinach
pie
,
go
to
Med
Cafe
.
If
you
're
on
the
East
side
and
you
're
desperate
,
go
to
Dimitri
's
.

Only
issue
is
that

-
Let
's
be

5
stars
is
an
incredible
score
,
but
here
is
why
I
gave
it
.
This
diner
is
a
hidden
gem
.
I
mean
hidden
,
the
only
reason
I
went
was
because
someone
told
me
about
it
.
It
is
located
in
the
Wisconsin
Aviation
building
off
of
Stoughton
Road
at
the
end
of
Amelia
Earhart
Dr.
There
are
no
signs
outside
for
this
restaurant
.
Once
inside
,
it
is
clean
,
tastefully
decorated
,
awesome
view
of
the
airport
,
attentive
service
and
finally
awesome
food
.
-
that
's
5
reasons

I
had
crab
cakes
Benedict
.
Oh
yea
!
That
is
as
good
as
it
sounds
baby
.
Then
I
upgraded
my
hash
browns
with
cheese
,
onions
,
and
peppers
.
Well
worth
the
up
charge
.
It
will
be
hard
for
me
to
pick
something
different
from
their
menu
when
I
go
back
,
AND
I
WILL
BE

Right

The

is
located
with
in
the
Wisconsin

,
which
is
across
the
field
from
where
the

You
can

A.
Lot
.
The
airy
pancakes
that
I
ordered
were
fluffy
,
and
really
the
best
I
've
had
in
Madison
.
It
sounds
like
a
``
guilty
pleasure
,
''
but
the
pancakes
are
truly
airy
that
it
does
n't
feel
heavy
on
the
stomach
after
clearing
the
plate
.
The
three
eggs
omelet
was
equally
spectacular
.
Plus
the
solid
cordial
service
seals
the
5-stars
deal
.
The
scene
is
a
clean
diner
,
but
as
my
friend
put
it
,
``
it
's
an
actual
diner
with
good
food
,
and
not
like
the
other
wanna-bes
.
''
Absolutely
correct
.
And
there
's
no
need
to
do
too
much
flare
on
the
decor
when
they
got
the
fantastic
view
of
the
private
planes
against
the
blue
sky
.
I
will
be
back
for
more
for
sure
!
Maybe
a
sunset
dinner
for
the
next
time?I
'm
a
big
fan
of
eating
Midwest
brunches
and
I
can
tell
quality
vs.
quantity
.
My
boyfriend
took
me
here
on
a
surprise
date
because
he
is
a
big
fan
of
watching
planes
take
off
,
so
I
thought
it
was
novel
to
have
brunch
there
.
The
quality
of
the
food
blew
me
away
as
well
as
the
friendly
service
.
We
ordered
crab
cakes
benedict
with
hollandaise
sauce
and
the
2x2x2
-LRB-
pancakes
,
2
eggs
,
bacon
,
and
fruit
cup
OR
hashbrowns
-RRB-
.
The
other
reviewers
down
below
are
correct
that
their
pancakes
are
TDF
light
airy
and
buttery
delicious
.
The
crab
cakes
benedicts
were
perfect
-
not
too
rich
,
and
not
too
heavy
and
very
nicely
presented
.
The
waitress
was
a
middle
aged
woman
who
was
very
attentive
to
us
.
The
price
is
also
very
reasonable
for
brunches
in
Madison
.
I
would
highly
recommend
this
place
,
and
I
believe
it
is
one
of
Madison
's
best
kept
secret
diners
.
It
was
n't
as
cheap
as
the
Come
Back
Inn
located
near
the
Essen
Haus
nor
Plaka
's
Mediterranean
meat
intensive
style
brunches
,
however
,
the
quality
was
far
superior
-LRB-
and
do
n't
get
me
wrong
,
I
adore
the

I
went
on
a
weekday
,
it
was
quite
crowded
but
Pat
O'Malley
was
hard
at
work
accommodating
us
as
best
he
could
.
We
sat
at
the
bar
and
had
a
fantastic
breakfast
.
Pat
took
the
time
to
ask
our
names
and
he
was
always
looking

Detailed
review
:
I
've
been
craving
some
pancakes
for
quite
some
time
and
have
been
on
a
mission
to
find
the
perfect
stack
.
I
've
recently
tried
`
cakes
from
several
Madison
eateries
and
while
most
have
been
decent
,
none
have
knocked
my
socks
off
.
So
,
I
ventured
out
to
Pat
O'Malley
's
,
which
is
located
on
the
very
north
side
of
Truax
field
.
Or
,
as
some
might
say
,
``
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
.
''
Yes
,
it
's
a
bit
of
a
drive
...
and
yes
,
it
's
a
bit
difficult
to
find
.
But
,
it
's
well
worth
the
effort
-
believe
me
.
The
Jet
Room
is
located
inside
of
the
aviation
building
,
which
-LRB-
for
those
not
familiar
-RRB-
is
where
people
lucky
enough
to
not
have
to
suffer
the
pains
associated
with
public
air
transportation
go
for
their
arrivals
and
departures
via
private
aircraft
.
The
building
features
a
nice
lobby
,
a
pilot
's
lounge
,
a
small
gift
shop
,
a
vending
area
,
a
front
desk
for
travelers
,
and
Pat
O'Malley
's
.
It
's
spotlessly
clean
,
quiet
,
and
completely
opposite
of
what
you
'd
find
at
any
public
airport
.
There
's
plenty
of
parking
available
in
front
of
the
building
.
I
entered
the
smallish
diner
and
was
promptly
greeted
by
a
friendly
hostess
and
seated
at
a
small
table
with
an
awesome
view
of
the
airstrip
.
Private
planes
of
all
types
-
from
small
jets
to
single
engine
craft
-
regularly
took
off
and
landed
during
my
visit
.
It
was
fun
to
watch
them
arrive
,
taxi
,
unload
,
and
all
of
that
stuff
.
Pat
's
serves
breakfast
all
day
-
or
until
they
close
,
which
is
around
2:00
pm
.
Because
I
arrived
at
lunchtime
,
they
shared
the
specials
,
which
sounded
-LRB-
and
looked
-RRB-
excellent
,
but
I
was
there
for
the
pancakes
.
I
promptly
ordered
a
coffee
,
an
order
of
pancakes
,
and
a
side
of
bacon
.
After
the
waitress
left
,
I
took
note
of
the
food
around
me
,
and
all
of
it
looked
great
.
The
burgers
appeared
to
be
thick
and
hand-formed
.
Many
sandwiches
featured
marbled
rye
.
The
fries
and
sides
were
plentiful
and
appeared
to
be
fresh
and
crispy
.
I
could
easily
overhear
folks
talking
during
their
meals
and
only
heard
positive
comments
about
the
lunch
items
.
I
'll
definitely
have
to
head
back
to
check
them
out
.
After
a
very
short
wait
,
my
food
arrived
-
the
pancakes
were
thick
,
but
as
Mio
confirmed
,
light
and
fluffy
.
Butter
was
served
on
the
side
;
I
lathered
the
cakes
with
some
of
that
creamy
dairy
,
splashed
on
my
home-brought
100
%
real
Vermont
Maple
-LRB-
grade
B
,
thankyouverymuch
-RRB-
,
and
took
a
bite
.
The
two
plate-sized
cakes
quickly
absorbed
the
syrup
,
which
made
for
a
delightfully
tasty
combination
.
The
pancakes
,
while
substantial
,
were
n't
heavy
or
overwhelming
.
A
hint
of
buttermilk
provided
just
enough
``
bite
''
to
the
syrup
.
Mmmmm
-
definitely
a
good
experience
.
But
the
hidden
star
was
the
bacon
.
It
was
perfectly
cooked
;
crispy
,
but
slightly
chewy
.
Thick
,
but
not
too
thick
.
Perfect
balance
of
everything
:
salt/smoke
,
thickness/chewiness
,
and
not
at
all
greasy
or
fatty
.
Win
.
The
check
came
-
$
8
for
my
meal
of
cakes
,
bacon
,
and
coffee
.
Service
was
excellent
-
the
waitress
was
quick
on
the
coffee
fills
,
made
sure
my
food
was
ok
,
and
promptly
delivered
the
check
and
my
change
.
A
$
4
tip
seemed
totally
fair
for
such
an
excellent
experience
-LRB-
plus
it
was
a
slow
Monday

the
amazing
gem
as
I
was
hoping
,
but
do
n't
let
me
knock
it
that
this
place
is
cool
.
Basically
,
it
's
a
diner
in
a
commuter
airport
on
the
outskirts
of
Madison
.
If
that
sounds
like
your
thing
,
check
it
out
.
Food
was
three
stars
,
but
it
was
solid
diner
food
.
Prices
are
weird
amounts
like
$
8.54
to
account
for
tax
.
Hilarious
.
Gets
busy
on
Sunday
mornings!Hard
to
find
a
good
$
100
burger
-LRB-
airport
restaurant
-RRB-
.
Had
an
awesome
BLT
with
great
service
and
an
ice
tea
for
$
10.90
plus
tip
.
Place
really
hops
at
lunch
time
,
for
good
reason.Not
as
good
overall
as
I
had
expected.Pretty
average
basic
breakfast
.
OK
service
...
Enjoyed
``
aviation
location
''
.
This
is
just
another
diner
with
good
breakfast
food
.
The
real
value
is
the
view
.
This
diner
sits
right
along
the
runway
of
a
small
airport
.
I
ordered
the
Chili
Cheese
omelet
w
/
hash
browns
.
I
recommend
paying
the
upcharge
to
get
cheese
and
peppers
tossed
into
your
hash
browns
.
I
loved
the
view
and
would
go
back
the
next
time
I
'm
in
Wisconsin.Short
review
.
One
of
the
top
five
breakfast
joints
in
Madison
,
and
I
've
been
to
ALL
of
them
.
Excellent
food
and
coffee
,
and
the
view
is
n't
bad
either.breakfast
rocks
here
!
do
it!This
place
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
.
We
flew
into
Madison
and
were
starving
.
We
always
rely
on
Yelp
when
we
travel
,
it
was
close
and
this
place
did
not
disappoint
.
It
is
inside
a
flight
services
building
but
the
place
is
really
clean
and
a
nice
view
of
the
runway.I
had
the
BLTCE
and
my
wife
had
the
flying
fish
sandwich
and
both
were
really
good
.
We
will
be
back
,
check
it
out.Great
morning
breakfast
spot
.
Take
the
kids
,
they
love
watching
the
planes.Unique
place
that
is
,
as
Steve
said
,
a
little
off
the
beaten
path
.
Pat
O'Malley
's
Jet
Room
is
a
pretty
no-frills
breakfast
place
-LRB-
they
offer
lunch
as
well
-RRB-
serving
up
some
good
diner
grub
.
Bonus
feature
:
You
can
watch
planes
take
off
and
land
while
you
're
chowin
'
down
.
Out
of
all
the
diners
in
Madison
that
I
've
been
to
,
the
Jet
Room
service
is
the
best
;
seriously
top-notch
.
Pat
or
his
wife
have
been
hosting
every
time
I
've
gone
-LRB-
and
have
even
remembered
my
name
when
I
went
a
couple
weekends
in
a
row
-RRB-
,
the
staff
are
friendly
and
always
on
top
of
things
.
I
get
a
pretty
good
mom
'n
pop
type
vibe
from
here
.
I
've
never
had
a
problem
with
the
food
here
.
It
's
solid
diner
food
;
nothing
unexpected
or
that
exciting
,
but
always
delicious
.
I
like
it
enough
that
it
's
one
of
the
few
places
where
I
'll
try
to
switch
my
order
every
time
I
head
over
there
.
Waits
are
long
on
weekends
,
so
call
ahead
or
expect
to
spend
some
time
looking
around
the
building.First
off
the
view
is
outstanding
.
O'Malley
's
is
right
off
the
runway
at
the
Madison
Airport
.
The
waitstaff
is
very
good
,
and
the
food
as
well
.
There
can
be
a
wait
so
do
not
expect
to
get
in
an
out
very
fast
.
I
recommend
trying
the
Jet
Room.very
good
food
.
excellent
service
!
eggs
benedict
is
the
specialty
here
and
it
's
excellent
.
decent
coffee
and
a
great
view
of
the
tarmac
,
right
outside
the
window.Cool
for
watching
planes
especially
with
kids
!
Solid
breakfast
and
great
atmosphere.The
Jet
Room
is
a
must
when
in
Madison
.
Watching
planes
take
off
and
land
while
eating
the
best
diner
breakfast
or
lunch
in
Madison
is
a
huge
hit
with
adults
and
kids
.
If
you
go
in
the
early
morning
you
can
also
watch
the
Truax
Fire
Department
Trucks
circle
the
air
field
on
their
morning
rounds
.
I
'd
highly
recommend
the
Scramble
for
breakfast
and
the
Wing
Walker
for
lunch
.
I
wish
they
were
open
past
2:00
pm
,
but
understand
they
are
tailoring
to
a
specific
food
type
.
GO
TO
THE
JET
ROOM
!
That
is
all.This
place
is
great
.
A
lot
of
people
do
n't
know
it
exists
,
or
think
it
's
just
for
pilots
.
The
Jet
Room
is
a
diner
with
a
great
view
the
Wisconsin
Aviation
Airport
runway
.
The
food
was
decent
,
but
I
do
n't
think
anyone
comes
here
for
the
food
.
It
's
all
about
the
view
.
I
had
the
sausage
scrambler
which
was
pretty
standard
.
Nothing
to
brag
about
,
but
it
did
the
trick
.
My
gf
had
the
salmon
benedict
.
It
looked
great
and
she
was
pretty
happy
with
it
.
It
's
a
busy
place
on
the
weekend
but
you
'll
be
entertained
while
waiting
for
your
table
.
Plenty
to
look
at.Excellent
,
excellent
food
!
Very
reasonable
also
.
I
would
highly
recommend
to
give
this
place
a
try
.
I
had
the
veggie
eggs
Benedict
on
an
English
muffin
.
Fantastic
!
They
offer
dishes
like
salmon
omlettes
,
salmon
eggs
Benedict
,
etc.
.
Very
good
quality
for
an
airport
diner.One
of
my
favorite
places
in
town
for
breakfast
.
It
's
quick
-LRB-
once
you
're
seated
-RRB-
.
It
's
greasy
-LRB-
like
breakfast
from
a
skillet
should
be
-RRB-
.
It
's
no-nonsense
-LRB-
hash
,
taters
,
eggs
-RRB-
.
It
's
served
with
a
smile
-LRB-
and
usually
some
awesome
conversation
-RRB-
.
Is
it
super
local
?
Super
sustainable
?
No
.
It
's
a
diner
.
But
a
delicious
one
.
And
there
are
planes!Was
thrilled
to
see
vegetarian
options
.
Very
nice
restaurant
,
clean
,
fun
decor
.
Son
absolutely
loved
watching
the
planes
land
&
take
off
.
Best
moment
was
seeing
plane
land
&
pilot
came
into
diner
-
was
very
cool
for
him
.
Had
California
Benedict
which
was
good
not
great
-
not
best
Hollandaise
but
was
n't
expecting
gourmet
granted
.
Liked
fruit
cup
that
was
offered
,
good
variety
.
Average
diner
food
but
good
menu
options
and
above
average
atmosphere
.
Host
was
delightful
but
service
was
slow
&
spotty.Excellent
service
,
friendly
staff
and
you
get
to
watch
plans
land
and
take
off
.
The
food
is
great
.
We
've
been
here
several
times
with
our
younger
kids
-LRB-
just
my
husband
and
I
and
with
extended
family
-RRB-
.
The
wait
has
never
been
that
long
.
They
work
to
get
you
seated
as
soon
as
possible
if
there
is
a
wait
.
Awesome
diner
food
with
daily
specials
.
Delicious
,
mouth
watering
diner
food
at
diner
prices
.
They
are
open
for
breakfast
,
brunch
and
lunch
.
Great
family
friendly
spot
.
Also
great
for
a
quick
bite
on
your
own
.
Highly
suggest
checking
this
place
out
if
you
have
n't
yet
.

Sorry
,
could
n't
resist
.
But
really
this
place
is
great
and
deserves
the
shoutin

.
Where
else
can
you
enjoy
a
yummy
breakfast
while
watching
planes
land
and
take
off
??
Nowhere
.
Nowhere
if
not
for
Pat
O
Malley
's
.
Nope
.
Anyways
,
as
we
were
sipping
on
our
coffees
and
enjoying
the
glorious
views
,

English

BISCUITS

my
current
obsession

YesssssThe
Jet
Room
and
some
decent
dinner
food
.
It
's
a
great
place
for
a
breakfast
.
But
honestly
I
do
n't
go
to
the
Jet
Room
for
the
food
.
It
's
the
view
that
keeps
me

excellent

excellent
food
at
reasonable
prices
ca
n't
go
wrongWe
were
in
Madison
for
a
wedding
and
chose
Pat
O'Learys
based
off
proximity
and
Yelp
reviews
.
We
were
so
glad
we
did
!
We
liked
it
so
much
we
came
back
the
next
morning
.
A
unique
dining
experience
being
able
to
see
all
the
small
planes
and
hear
the
pilot
talk
among
the
patrons
.
And
the
first
day
we
met
both
Pat
and
Pam
as
we
were
checking
out
,
they
were
both
so
nice
and
shared
stories
with
us
about
the
small
airport
.
The
food
is
classic
diner
fare
,
and
does
n't
disappoint
.
Definitively
recommend
this
place
for
both
the
food
and
the
experience.Great
diner
with
the
added
benefit
of
being
able
to
see
planes
land
and
take
off
!
Went
for
breakfast
on
a
Saturday
morning
.
It
's
a
bit
of
drive
from
the
West
Side
,
but
worth
it
.
Prices
are
reasonable
and
portions
are
generous
.
Service
was
great
.
Typical
diner
food
,
but
all
the
prices
are
plane
model
numbers
,
which
ads
to
the
experience
a
bit
I
think
.
Best
part
are
the
giant
windows
that
let
you
see
the
private
terminal
tarmac
of
the
Dane
County
Regional
Airport
.
We
saw
three
or
four
planes
land
,
taxi
and
take
off
during
our
hour
meal.Did
you
know
that
J.
Pat
O'Malley
provided
voice
acting
for
many
classic
Disney
films
in
the
1950s
&
60s
,
including
Alice
in
Wonderland
,
One
Hundred
and
One
Dalmatians
,
and
The
Jungle
Book
?
He
was
also
lauded
for
his
character
acting
both
on
the
Broadway
stage
and
American
TV/film
after
moving
from
his
native
England
.
As
far
as
I
know
,
the
gentleman
referenced
above
has
absolutely
no
connection
to
one
of
the
best
named
restaurants
out
there
:
Pat
O'Malley
's
Jet
Room
.
Any
breakfast/brunch
venue
with
a
high
quality
skillet
gets
my
beans
a
`
boiling
,
and
POMJR
definitely
boils
my
beans
.
Add
in
the
potential
entertainment
value
of
witnessing
airway
disaster
at
any
time
and
you
have
a
recipe
for
a
high
quality
morning
that
would
make
J.
Pat
O'Malley
proud
.
Minus
one
star
for
no
booze
or
high
quality
bloody
-LRB-
that
I
can
recall
-RRB-
Newer
diner
-LRB-
was
expecting
older
-RRB-
with
great
service
with
a
neat
view
.
Food
was
very
delicious
but
it
's
hard
to
swallow
the
price
tags
.
$
9.50
for
a
BLT
sandwich
?
I
guess
you
're
paying
for
the
view
,
which
is
kind
of
cool
but
I
'd
rather
not
pay
double
.
Was
passing
through
-
I
live
in
Chicago
where
I
understand
get
establishments
and
you
pay
$
$
$
but
did
n't
think
I
'd
see
it
Wisconsin
.
Eat
there
once
when
you
're
feeling
rich
.
We
loved
all
the
old
pics
on
the
wall
and
the
original
``

''
sign
hanging
-LRB-
vintage
neon
-RRB-
.
Shannon
gave
us
excellent
service!Grade
:
C
Loud
.
Cheap
.
Okay
overall.They
have
an
acoustics
problem
here
.
It
's
horribly
loud
in
there
,
and
everything
feels
rushed
and
crushed
together
.
I
had
some
vegetarian
sandwich
,
it
was
mediocre
and
gave
me
heartburn
supreme
.
Blah
.
Also
there
was
an
article
on
MSNBC
that
revealed
that
Panera
uses
additives
in
their
bakery
items
that
cause
hyper
activity
in
young
children
.
So
if
you
are
looking
for
a
place
that
's
crowded
,
loud
,
has
mediocre
food
and
pocked
with
spastic
,
hyper
active
children
who
will
gnaw
on
your
leg
,
go
here.Good
food
but
odd
that
they
lost
my
lunch
order
.
Thanks
to
those
manning
the
counter
who
realized
I
was
waiting
and
filled
the
order
on
the
spot.saw
a
fly
dancing
on
my
sandwich
when
waiting
for
my
order
,
they
do
n't
bother
to
pay
attention
anyway
since
there
are
quite
a
lot
customers
,
awful
awful
place
even
though
i
have
very
good
experience
with
other
panera
breadThis
Panera
would
have
gotten
5
stars
a
few
years
ago
when
I
practically
lived
there
the
month
I
was
finishing
up
my
grad
school
portfolio
.
But
those
lovely
leather
armchairs
that
I
so
loved
so
sit
with
a
drink
and
a
pastry
are
now
gone
.
Lounging
around
all
day
is
no
longer
encouraged
,
it
would
seem
.
That
being
said
,
this
Panera
is
still
a
pretty
great
one
.
Quick
service
,
friendly
faces
,
always
clean
.
You
really
ca
n't
go
wrong
with
soup
in
a
bread
bowl.Love
the
sour
dough
bread
...
they
make
great
grilled
cheese
.
The
bagels
are
n't
too
bad
...
.
they
will
make
due
until
the
next
time
you
get
to
New
York
.
My
favorite
bagel
is
a
fresh
asiago
cheese
with
tons
of
cream
cheese
.
Yum
!
The
broccoli
cheese
soup
is
also
very
tasty
.
I
love
that
they
have
cage
free
eggs
and
antibac
free
chicken
.
I
appreciate
that
they
are
starting
to
care
more
about
the
products
they
are
serving
.
The
only
question
I
have
is
this
...
are
the
chickens
free
range
?
This
Panera
is
rather
loud
and
always
busy.Good
foodI
called
to
order
my
lunch
,
the
lady
put
me
on
`
hold
'
or
mute
for
5
minutes
...
she
was
kinda
sassy
but
besides
that
the
people
there
are
really
nice
and
the
food
is
excellent
.
Not
too
loud
or
busy
after
1
ishI
came
here
with
my
girlfriend
for
breakfast
,
I
had
a
bagel
with
cream
cheese
and
she
had
a
breakfast
sandwich
and
we
both
got
coffee
drinks
.
The
food
was
made
quickly
but
we
had
to
wait
almost
ten
minutes
for
our
drinks
to
be
made
but
the
staff
was
friendly
and
the
food
was
really
goodCome
to
this
location
Monday
thru
Friday
between
9am
and
11am
and
it
's
dead
,
my
favorite
time
to
go.Old
school
greasy
spoon
food
and
very
nice
service
.
It
's
a
throwback
to
another
time
and
a
good
one
at
that.Excellent
prices
,
wonderful
basic
food
,
and
outstanding
service
.
The
wait
staff
is
very
efficient
and
consistent
,
and
I
particularly
enjoy
the
potatoes
obrien
.
Open
only
until
2pm
,
for
breakfast
and
lunch.Good
food
,
good
prices
,
good
service
.
Simple
little
breakfast
diner
.
Down
to
earth
and
delicious
.
If
I
lived
here
I
would
def
b
a
regular!Awesome
breakfast!This
is
definitely
a
throw-back
to
little
town
diners
.
The
food
is
basic
,
but
well
made
and
cheap
.
Really
cheap
.
Nothing
over
$
8
on
the
menu
and
most
things
in
the
$
5-6
range
for
breakfast
which
is
served
all
day
.
I
recently
went
here
on
a
weekday
morning
that
I
had
off
work
and
the
place
was
mostly
filled
with
older
guys
sitting
around
in
groups
drinking
their
coffee
discussing
the
weekend
football
games
.
You
can
tell
this
is
the
type
of
place
that
people
visit
every
day
to
chat
with
neighbors
and
have
the
community
feeling
.
Service
is
prompt
and
efficient
.
On
weekends
there
can
be
a
short
wait
,
but
never
anything
too
bad.what
a
great
place
...
the
owner
is
very
friendly
,
food
awesome
,
and
good
value
:
we
will
def
.
return!I
want
to
give
this
dump
a
big
fat
0
.
My
mother
and
I
went
this
past
weekend
very
hopeful
that
the
food
would
be
good
based
on
the
fact
they
won
Best
in
Madison
.
How
on
earth
did
this
place
win
any
award
for
great
food
and
service
is
beyond
me
.
The
menu
was
extremely
old
,
small
and
the
coffee
was
pure
water
.
I
order
the
walleye
,
hash
browns
,
toast
and
eggs
breakfast
.
My
mother
order
biscuits
and
gravy
My
toast
was
cold
,
hash
browns
had
no
tastes
,
over
easy
eggs
were
not
cooked
fully
and
fish
was
very
small
in
size
.
Mothers
gravy
was
too
salty
and
a
thick
bunch
of
sop
.
The
menu
had
no
coordination
.
Biscuit
,
gravy
and
hash
browns
?
That
is
nothing
but
starch
!
With
that
aside
,
Not
only
that
but
the
server
was
horrible
.
I
felt
like
she
ignored
my
mother
and
I
the
entire
time
.
I
understand
they
were
kinda
busy
.
Fine
.
We
can
be
patient
.
However
,
she
refilled
coffees
at
her
other
tables
and
stopped
by
to
tell
the
customers
their
food
was
being
made
after
waiting
for
so
long
.
We
did
not
receive
such
treatment
.
She
passed
our
table
several
times
and
never
once
asked
us
how
was
the
food
or
why
our
orders
were
taking
so
long
.
Not
once
.
She
was
a
horrible
waitress
.
Neither
my
mother
or
I
could
finish
our
food
.
I
took
possibly
4
bites
and
was
done
.
We
spent
less
time
eating
then
we
did
waiting
and
ordering
.
Waitress
continued
to
ignore
us
,
so
we
got
up
and
just
walked
over
to
pay
.
I
told
the
cashier
the
food
was
horrible
and
I
would
n't
be
back
.
She
then
stated
to
us
that
normally
the
food
is
good
and
she
was
n't
sure
why
it
was
taking
the
kitchen
so
long
and
were
getting
orders
wrong
.
But
here
is
the
killer
...
she
then
leans
over
and
says
''
I
hate
our
kitchen
staff
,
we
need
new
ones
''
What
kind
of
place
does
that
?
You
do
no
throw
your
co
workers
under
the
bus
TO
CUSTOMERS
!
I
was
beyond
flabbergasted
.
Just
a
horrible
business
,
not
friendly
and
food
is
beyond
pathetic
.
Do
not
go
here
.
I
have
no
idea
who
in
their
right
mind
would
vote
them
as
``
Best
in
Madison
''
or
give
it
5
stars
unless
you
do
not
have
taste
buds
.
If
you
want
great
food
,
coffee
AND
service
,
go
to
The
Original
Pancake
House
in
Monona.Came
here
a
few
times
and
always
had
really
good
food
and
friendly
service
!
Thanks
again!I
think
I
just
fell
in
love
.
I
loooove
breakfast
.
Love
it
.
Sometimes
,
I
get
really
overwhelmed
by
large
,
fancy
menus
.
So
you
can
imagine
,
what
a
breath
of
fresh
air
,
the
Cottage
Cafe
was
.
We
walked
in
at
9
am
.
Early
,
but
not
too
early
.
The
place
was
packed
.
Wow
.
I
walked
up
to
the
register
and
little
did
I
know
,
but
it
is
a
seat
yourself
place
.
There
was
no
sign
.
So
we
waited
a
few
minutes
for
a
table
to
open
and
sat
down
.
I
am
a
simple
person
,
I
ordered
the
special
of
biscuits
and
gravy
with
two
eggs
.
The
menu
had
quite
a
few
other
options
.
My
husband
ordered
the
steak
,
two
eggs
and
hash
browns
.
$
8
.
This
is
probably
the
most
expensive
item
on
their
menu
.
My
gravy
was
perfect
.
It
was
thick
without
being
sludgy
.
It
had
the
right
amount
of
seasoning
.
I
received
my
breakfast
on
two
plates
because
the
biscuits
and
gravy
were
overwhelming
a
single
plate
.
I
ordered
scrambled
eggs
.
They
were
bland
and
flat
.
I
spied
my
neighbors
omelette
which
looked
much
more
appetizing
.
Our
whole
bill
-LRB-
for
two
people
-RRB-
was
$
16
and
some
change
.
Bottomless
coffee
and
breakfast
.
Wow
.
Oh
,
parking
is
tough
.
There
is
only
one
shared
lot.I
'm
a
big
fan
of
having
breakfast
here
,
so
this
is
a
breakfast
review
.
I
enjoy
the
steak
and
eggs
/
hash
brown
breakfast
.
Each
time
I
've
ordered
this
,
the
steak
it
a
great
breakfast
sized
sirloin
perfectly
cooked
.
Nothing
is
every
very
fancy
or
trendy
at
the
cottage
café
,
it
is
just
straight
up
down
home
traditional
breakfast
cooking
.
Coffee
,
Eggs
,
biscuits
,
hash
,
sausage
,
bacon
,
pancakes
,
toast
.
The
essentials
.
Who
needs
anything
else
when
your
hungry
and
want
someone
else
to
cook
for
you
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
right
?
Plenty
of
seating
,
but
a
word
of
warning
...
I
'm
not
the
only
person
who
loves
this
café
.
It
fills
up
very
quickly
on
the
weekends
and
you
may
be
waiting
for
a
seat
.
Service
is
very
good
every
time
.
Bottomless
Coffee
just
keeps
on
coming
!
I
love
that
.
The
pricing
is
the
best
part
!
Nothing
like
getting
a
great
plate
of
food
for
a
more
than
willing
to
pay
price
.
I
believe
my
go
to
Steak/eggs/hash
browns/toast
is
around
$
7.99
.
Ya
!
Amazing
right
!
Between
my
wife
and
me
,
I
have
not
seen
our
breakfast
bill
over
$
17
bucks
yet
...
including
each
ordering
coffee
.
So
Like
I
said
...
Nothing
fancy
,
just
great
traditional
breakfast
food
at
great
prices.I
love
breakfast
,
and
at
Cottage
Cafe
,
they
really
get
it
right
.
The
food
is
the
biggest
hit
with
lots
of
basic
American
breakfast
fare
options
.
Expect
to
leave
stuffed
as
the
portion
sizes
are
pretty
big
.
The
coffee
service
is
awesome
and
the
whole
staff
is
quite
friendly
and
efficient
.
You
get
all
of
this
at
a
super
reasonable
price.Incredible
service
and
amazing
food
!
Eggs
Benedict
meal
was
one
of
the
best
ones
I
have
had
in
a
long
time
!
Prices
are
very
,
very
great
-
fairly
inexpensive!First
of
all
,
how
has
no
one
reviewed
Michael
's
yet
?
They
have
the
best
everything
!
The
best
frozen
yogurt
,
certainly
the
best
fried
cheese
curds
EVER
,
and
the
best
root
beer
.
Michael
's
is
open
kind
of
later
than
you
might
expect
,
and
has
a
nice
patio
to
sit
outside
in
the
summer
.
They
now
offer
K-9
custard
,
so
you
can
bring
your
dog
too
!
My
cat
likes
ice
cream
,
I
wonder
if
K-9
custard
could
be
good
for
felines?Thank
god
Michelle
reviewed
this
place
.
She
's
taken
me
here
before
and
IT
RULED
but
I
coud
n't
remember
the
name
.
I
wish
we
had
a
place
like
Michael
's
even
half
as
good
in
Minneapolis
.
Every
single
time
I
have
frozen
custard
it
tastes
like
butter
and
,
while
some
may
find
that
awesome
,
it
happens
to
make
my
gag
reflex
go
crazy
.
The
custard
at
Michael
's
is
pretty
much
perfect
and
the
root
beer
is
SO
good
.
I
do
n't
even
like
root
beer
that
much
but
I
would
drink
this
stuff
every
day
if
I
could
.
I
'm
sure
I
'd
love
the
K-9
custard
,
too
.
Who
cares
,
I
'm
sure
it
's
ten
times
better
than
the
solid
half
and
half
a
lot
of
places
are
trying
to
pass
off
as
custard
around
here.i
can
not
believe
that
no
one
had
yelped
this
place
-
thank
you
jaymi
and
michelle
,
you
are
geniuses
.
my
friends
from
madison
visiting
a
couple
weeks
ago
told
me
that
michaels
is
just
as
it
was
when
i
was
there
maybe
8
years
ago
so
this
review
should
be
accurate
.
one
word
sums
it
up
.
PERFECTION
.
they
also
told
me
they
dont
go
often
,
or
at
least
every
day
,
which
i
would
.
you
would
be
beyond
obese
but
it
would
be
worth
it
.
i
have
only
had
the
frozen
custard
here
and
being
lactose
intolerant
but
in
denial
makes
it
a
rough
experience
.
there
is
nothing
like
this
in
the
world
-
italian
gelati
,
nopee
,
argentine
ice
cream
del
dios
,
cant
touch
this
shit
.
michaels
frozen
custard
is
literally
the
best
taste
sensation
i
have
experienced
in
my
life
.
that
is
a
big
statement
and
im
owning
it
.
it
doesnt
even
matter
what
flavor
you
get
,
its
that
good
.
you
dont
even
have
to
get
toppings
on
it
-
though
i
would
toss
some
peanut
butter
cup
chunks
on
.
could
be
worth
the
drive
to
madison
alone.First
of
all
,
this
is
not
the
original
location
...
that
's
why
you
see
so
few
reviews
here
on
the
Atwood
store
.
However
,
they
still
have
the
cute
umbrellas
and
the
luscious
custard
we
all
love
.
Stopped
in
to
get
a
fix
and
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
--
delicious
frozen
custard
sundaes
and
hot
fried
cheese
curds
.
Could
it
get
any
better
?
Only
if
you
made
the
entry
way
and
the
outdoor
tables
more
accessible
for
friends
and
family
in
wheelchairs
,
and
your
servers
a
little
friendlier
and
better
.
We
sat
outside
in
the
sunshine
and
watched
everybody
drive
by
and
stare
back
at
us
jealously.I
had
Death
By
Chocolate
.
Now
I
am
dead
and
loving
it.Each
trip
home
I
need
,
need
to
stop
by
here
for
the
requisite
small
turtle
sundae
:
its
melty
eggshell-white
frozen
custard
,
hot
fudge
,
caramel
,
a
pile
of
pecans
and
cherry
on
top
makes
my
day
.
Or
my
year
.
Take
a
pint
to-go
,
too
.
I
'm
currently
dreaming
about
their
pumpkin
custard
.
Mmm.Cheddar
burger
,
check
.
Vanilla
shake
,
check
.
Food
coma
,
double
check
!!!
This
place
is
old
school
burgers
,
fries
and
shakes
;
and
they
are
good
at
what
they
do!The
custard
is
really
fantastic
-
creamy
-
the
best
.
The
other
food
,
though
,
is
notably
disappointing
.
I
've
had
a
couple
of
burgers
there
and
they
were
greasy
and
half-hearted
concoctions
.
I
also
think
that
the
counter
staff
could
be
a
lot
better
.
They
always
seem
sullen
and
taciturn
.
In
the
winter
you
get
the
impression
that
they
are
n't
really
even
supposed
to
be
open
.
That
is
all
a
shame
,
though
,
because
the
interior
is
decent
-
50
's
diner
style
-
and
they
could
surely
draw
in
a
very
decent
off-season
crowd
if
they
chose
to
work
on
the
food
and
the
staff
's
comportment.Go
for
the
custard
,
and
if
you
are
doing
drive
through
and
want
the
flavor
of
the
day
,
be
sure
to
ask
for
it
fresh
.
I
was
sure
Culver
's
just
down
the
way
would
drive
a
stake
through
Michael
's
when
it
opened
a
few
years
back
,
but
it
has
n't
happened
.
For
those
of
us
who
like
the
real
thing
,
that
's
something
to
be
happy
about
.
I
've
been
happy
with
their
veggie
burgers
and
ca
n't
complain
about
the
food
over
all
.
Drive
in
kinda
food
...
Being
from
out
of
state
,
I
'm
not
a
custard
expert
.
However
,
even
an
idiot
knows
that
this
place
is
good
after
just
one
taste
.
I
enjoyed
the
black
forest
flavor
of
the
day
.
Creamy
chocolate
and
cherries
.
Make
sure
to
walk
through
the
back
parking
lot
,
through
the
grassy
area
and
down
to
the
lake
to
enjoy
your
treat.Better
than
Culvers
.
But
more
expensive.If
you
stop
eating
frozen
custard
for
a
while
and
then
go
back
to
it
,
you
wish
you
never
tried
it
again
.
After
a
few
years
frequenting
this
place
,
the
Oreo
malt
is
the
only
thing
I
consider
ordering
.
And
that
is
only
if
someone
I
'm
with
really
wants
to
go
and
is
paying
for
it
.
Prices
are
obscene
.
All
of
the
food
is
greasy
,
bland
,
and
expensive.Good
,
wisconsin-esque
experience
.
The
flavors
of
the
day
,
mint
oreo
,
then
cookie
dough
,
were
just
ok
.
Would
go
back
,
unless
I
found
someplace
better.I
was
there
on
a
hot
Sat
in
June
.
They
had
one
clerk
and
some
other
guy
learning
over
try
to
hear
the
order
.
Should
n't
the
outside
order
window
be
opened
.
I
order
the
basket
and
the
clerk
specifically
asked
me
for
fries
,
onion
rings
,
and
cheez
curds
.
What
I
ended
up
in
my
basket
were
onion
petals
.
These
are
n't
rings
-LRB-
they
used
to
serve
rings
-RRB-
but
that
's
not
what
I
got
.
I
got
about
10
and
they
used
to
serve
big
portions
.
This
location
did
n't
have
fountain
drinks
and
had
the
choice
of
soda
in
a
can
.
They
used
to
have
fountain
drinks.Finally
,
the
last
thing
that
made
mad
as
a
wet
wasp
is
the
prices
listed
are
cash
prices
.
If
use
a
credit
card
you
pay
3
%
more
.
A
flavor
OF
THE
DAY
-LRB-
fod
-RRB-
is
about
3.70
while
a
whole
pint
is
about
4.99
.
You
can
always
get
the
FOD
in
a
pint
so
I
would
go
with
a
whole
pint
.
Basket
are
about
5.99
to
6.70
but
bring
your
cash
or
add
3
%
to
the
already
absorbent
prices.The
best
frozen
custard
!
It
's
very
smooth
and
creamy
though
a
bit
sweet
.
Every
time
I
go
to
Madison
,
I
need
to
stop
here
for
some
creamy
frozen
treat
.
The
chocolate
pecan
is
my
favorite.I
like
this
place
.
Nothing
super
special
,
but
still
one
of
the
best
custard
places
in
town
.
I
always
get
dog
ice
cream
for
my
pups.I
'm
a
frozen
custard
novice
,
so
maybe
i
'll
revise
this
after
I
've
tried
some
other
places
.
We
came
here
at
about
9:30
on
a
Thursday
night
and
it
was
pretty
dead
.
I
think
we
were
expecting
a
normal
ice
cream
shop
kind
of
atmosphere
,
with
a
big
case
of
flavors
to
look
at
,
so
we
had
a
bit
of
a
deer-in-headlights
moment
when
we
first
walked
in
,
trying
to
figure
out
what
we
were
supposed
to
order
.
It
turns
out
they
only
have
3
flavors
-LRB-
vanilla
,
chocolate
,
and
one
other
-RRB-
per
day
,
and
most
of
your
choices
come
from
what
sort
of
sundae
you
get
.
Once
we
figured
that
out
,
a
number
of
the
sundae
choices
seemed
pretty
solid
.
I
ended
up
going
with
Turtle
,
and
my
husband
got
the
Peanut
Butter
Cup
.
Both
were
excellent
.
The
chocolate
shell
on
the
PBC
was
nicely
chocolaty
,
especially
for
that
kind
of
a
product
,
and
I
appreciated
that
they
did
n't
skimp
on
the
pecans
for
the
Turtle
.
We
both
had
smalls
,
which
were
QUITE
ample
.
We
also
got
a
K9
custard
for
our
dog
,
which
she
appeared
to
enjoy
.
I
guess
I
just
have
a
couple
of
objections
that
keep
this
from
being
a
4-star
place
.
First
,
I
wish
they
had
more
flavors
,
since
I
do
n't
always
want
a
sundae
-LRB-
but
maybe
this
is
characteristic
of
frozen
custard
joints
and
is
not
a
fair
criticism
-RRB-
.
Second
,
I
think
it
should
be
served
slightly
colder
so
that
it
does
n't
melt
as
fast
when
the
hot
fudge
hits
it
.
Third
,
I
felt
that
it
was
a
bit
overpriced
for
a
fast
food-style
place
.
This
is
especially
true
of
the
K9
custard
,
since
we
're
used
to
getting
something
more
along
the
lines
of
a
79-cent
kiddie
cone
for
the
dog
.
We
'll
probably
be
back
,
since
its
in
the
neighborhood
,
but
this
will
not
be
the
last
frozen
dessert
purveyor
I
visit
in
Madison.Stick
with
Culvers
!
My
family
and
I
stopped
by
on
our
way
biking
around
the
lake
.
What
a
rude
and
disappointing
experience
.
First
of
all
the
staff
who
waited
on
us
,
Andrea
was
short
tempered
and
not
into
customer
service
.
We
tried
to
order
swirl
,
but
they
do
n't
have
it
,
we
had
to
come
up
with
a
solution
,
Andrea
just
said
no
.
We
ordered
a
cone
,
small
sundae
and
a
can
of
coke
.
About
$
10.00
later
,
I
was
grudging
given
a
glass
filled
about
1/3
full
of
ice
for
my
not
very
chilled
coke
.
The
custard
is
ok
,
but
nothing
special
.
Another
option
would
to
be
to
continue
on
the
bike
path
.
In
Monona
there
is
an
ice
cream
stop
by
a
park
on
the
lake
.
We
will
try
that
next
time.For
all
the
hype
,
Michael
's
is
quite
a
disappointment
.
Maybe
it
's
because
I
did
n't
try
the
custard
.
But
seriously
,
I
did
n't
need
more
weighing
down
in
this
weather
...
so
I
ordered
an
orange
crush
float
instead
.
For
something
that
would
have
cost
me
MAYBE
50cents
to
make
at
home
,
I
paid
close
to
$
5
for
a
12oz
cup
.
That
is
ridiculous
.
In
general
,
I
think
their
prices
are
pretty
steep
for
what
you
get
...
you
'd
probably
have
to
order
a
burger
to
really
get
a
bang
for
your
buck
...
Like
RB
,
I
also
had
an
issue
with
the
service
.
It
was
slow
,
disorganized
,
and
not
very
friendly
.
The
line
was
almost
out
the
door
,
but
the
employees
behind
the
counter
did
n't
even
ATTEMPT
to
speed
up
the
service
.
One
of
them
just
disappeared
into
a
back
room
.
tsktsk
.
I
also
thought
it
was
hilarious
how
one
of
the
employees
crumpled
up
an
order
form
before
the
order
had
been
completed
,
and
then
had
to
UNcrumple
the
paper
so
she
could
re-read
the
order
to
her
coworker
.
Really
?
Anyway
,
I
will
probably
give
the
Monroe
St.
Michael
's
-
and
their
custards/burgers
-
a
shot
,
but
I
'm
not
going
to
get
my
hopes
up.This
was
my
first
visit
.
I
love
the
interior
decoration
of
this
place
.
Clean
.
Had
a
really
yummy
sundae
.
A
bit
pricey
though.Great
custard
,
fresh
toppings
,
overall
its
amazing
.
$
$
$
though
.
I
paid
$
4
for
a
chocolate
shake
and
it
was
not
even
that
big
.
A
cheaper
alternative
,
obviously
Culvers
.
I
would
still
recommend
Michaels
though.Just
had
the
worst
tasting
greasy
cheesburger
I
have
ever
had
.
Served
with
about
5
french
fries.In
Madison
to
watch
some
club
soccer
at
the
park
down
the
road
.
Skipped
breakfast
and
needed
to
fill
my
belly
with
some
lip
lickin
food
that
comes
fast
.
Michael
's
looked
like
a
gimmick
,
but
was
the
closest
place
I
could
find
.
They
're
going
for
a
50s
nostalgia
drive-thru
and
for
the
most
part
it
works
!
I
recommend
going
inside
to
also
taste
the
retro
ambiance
.
Food
?
Happy
to
report
significantly
better
than
your
average
fast
food
joint
.
My
bacon
cheeseburger
was
dripping
with
just
off
the
grill
grease
.
It
's
a
quality
burger
with
fresh
veggies
to
boot
.
And
you
wo
n't
find
fries
like
this
even
at
a
sitdown
restaurant
.
Holy
delicious
.
Next
time
I
'll
try
the
shake.Please
do
not
ever
go
here
.
This
is
a
public
service
announcement
.
I
do
not
even
know
you
and
I
like
you
too
much
to
suggest
this
place
.

Prices
?!
Are
you
kidding
me
?
$
6
for
a
milkshake
?
It
was
tiny
.
Not
to
mention
it
was
not
much
of
a
milkshake
.
It
was
a
peanut
butter
cup
shake
.
They
took
some
peanut
butter
cups
,
crushed
them
and
stirred
them
into
custard
with
some
milk
.
I
saw
the
whole
process
.
It
was
not
very
impressive
whatsoever
.
The
flavor
was
ok
.
2
-
The
food
.
I
had
a
chili
cheese
dog
.
This
is
my
standard
order
when
it
is
available
on
the
menu
.
The
chili
tasted
like
Hormel
.
The
hot
dog
was
hot
and
the
chili
was
warm
.
I
like
that
they
have
shredded
cheese
on
it
,
rather
than
liquid
cheese
.
3
-
My
dining
companion
got
a
burger
.
It
tasted
ok
,
but
it
was
a
very
thing
patty
.
He
also
ordered
cheese
curds
with
it
.
They
were
so
greasy
and
lacked
any
good
flavor
in
the
breading
.
Overall
,
we
spent
nearly
$
20
there
and
I
was
not
satisfied
with
my
meal
.
Every
talks
so
much
about
how
great
the
custard
is
.
Nope
.
Not
good
.
Go
to
Culver
's
!
Seriously
,
for
$
6
you
can
get
something
TWICE
the
size
with
more
mix-ins
.
Better
yet
?
Get
a
cone
for
you
AND
a
friend.A
freezer
full
of
titles
that
need
to
be
decoded
!
I
asked
the
counter
guy
the
tough
questions
:
``
What
's
the
difference
between
bear
claw
,
elephant
trax
,
and
badger
trax
?
''
I
ca
n't
remember
what
the
difference
was
other
than
that
elephant
trax
sounded
the
best
.
I
did
n't
want
to
risk
ending
my
day
with
artificial
caramel
,
so
chose
the
chocolate
custard
with
peanut
butter
cups
.
Perhaps
a
little
steep
at
upwards
of
$
5
per
pint
,
but
hey
,
it
's
not
much
more
expensive
than
regular-price
Haagen-Dazs
or
Ben
&
Jerry
's
is
getting
these
days
,
and
I
think
it
's
at
least
on
par
,
plus
it
's
freshly
made!Michael
's
has
been
around
forever
...
I
've
eaten
more
sundaes
here
than
I
care
to
admit
.
And
,
without
fail
,
they
are
good
.
Every
.
Single
.
Time
.
Yes
,
they
are
a
bit
pricey
.
Yes
,
they
may
be
small
for
what
you
get
.
Yes
they
are
all
pretty
similar
.
But
darn
it
.
They
are
so
stinkin
'
good
.
Just
eat
them
before
they
melt
,
because
gosh
does
custard
melt
faster
than
ice
cream
!!
I
have
never
eaten
the
``
real
''
food
at
this
location
-
so
I
ca
n't
comment
on
that
.
But
the
sundaes
are
worth
it
every
time.Note
:
I
have
only
ordered
delivery
,
and
that
I
've
ordered
online
.
That
said
,
the
pizza
we
've
gotten
from
here
has
been
consistently
fresh
,
hot
,
and
tasty
.
I
think
there
's
only
been
one
time
that
I
was
disappointed
with
the
consistency
of
the
dough
,
hence
three
stars
instead
of
four.Craving
a
thin
crust
Pizza
Hut
pizza
last
night
I
called
this
place
at
8PM
for
a
delivery
.
.
They
were
out
of
pizza
,
yes
out
of
thin
crust
pizza
...
I
said
that
's
like
McDonalds
being
out
of
cheeseburgers
,
and
was
hung
up
on
!?
Unbelievable!In
a
world
where
money
buys
you
food
--
why
would
you
come
here
and
buy
cardboard
?
Pizza
Hut
in
general
has
gone
downhill
so
far
,
it
's
not
even
funny
.
I
remember
when
I
was
a
kid
in
the
early
80
's
,
Pizza
Hut
was
awesome
.
Now
,
it
's
all
horrible.Cheese
sticks
were
under
cooked
,
the
pizza
was
EXTREMELY
greasy
.
I
mean
,
oil
was
literally
dripping
out
of
the
crust
.
Gross
.
It
also
had
kind
of
a
funky
aftertaste
.
Wings
were
okay
.
With
so
many
options
for
good
pizza
in
town
,
there
is
pretty
much
no
reason
to
eat
at
pizza
hut
,
even
if
it
does
save
you
a
few
bucks
.
Boo-urns
.
