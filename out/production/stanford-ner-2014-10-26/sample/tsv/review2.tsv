Good
truck
stop
dining
at
the
right
price
.
We
love
coming
here
on
the
weekends
when
we
do
n't
feel
like
cooking.The
dinner
was
wonderful
.
The
breakfast
is
very
tasty
and
nutritionated
.
We
ate
the
pizza
at
that
restaurant
and
it
is
not
much
good
and
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
bad
.
the
services
provided
and
the
taked
away
lunch
also
was
very
tasy
and
the
lunch
packet
size
is
also
acceptable
.
over
all
rating
for
their
food
items
are
reasonable
.
