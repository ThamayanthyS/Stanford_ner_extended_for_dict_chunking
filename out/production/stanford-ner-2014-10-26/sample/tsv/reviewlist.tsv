of	O

It	O

I	O

if	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

what	O

this	O

was	O
insane	O

I	O

we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
an	O
hour	O
for	O
our	O

On	O
the	O
plus	O

we	O

to	O
wait	O
an	O
hour	O
for	O
our	O

which	O
meant	O
an	O
hour	O
of	O
drinking	O
so	O
I	O
ca	O

Because	O
we	O

It	O
can	O

turns	O
to	O

at	O
you	O
when	O
you	O
walk	O
in	O

Sundays	O
can	O
be	O
the	O
worst	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
people	O
nearly	O
live	O
there	O

pretty	O

I	O
would	O

I	O
sometimes	O
pick	O

the	O

something	O

about	O
9:30	O
on	O
a	O
Thursday	O
night	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
dead	O

I	O
think	O
we	O
were	O
expecting	O
a	O
normal	O
ice	FOOD
cream	FOOD
shop	O
kind	O
of	O
atmosphere	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
big	O
case	O
of	O
flavors	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
deer-in-headlights	FOOD
moment	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
walked	O
in	O

trying	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
supposed	O
to	O

It	O
turns	O
out	O
they	O
only	O
have	O
3	O
flavors	O
-LRB-	O
vanilla	FOOD

and	O
one	O

-RRB-	O

and	O
most	O
of	O
your	O

come	O
from	O

you	O

Once	O
we	O
figured	O
that	O
out	O
,	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
the	O

seemed	O

I	O
ended	O
up	O
going	O
with	O
Turtle	FOOD
,	O
and	O
my	O
husband	O
got	O
the	O
Peanut	FOOD
Butter	FOOD
Cup	O
.	O
Both	O
were	O
excellent	O
.	O
The	O
chocolate	FOOD
shell	O
on	O
the	O
PBC	O
was	O
nicely	O
chocolaty	O
,	O
especially	O
for	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O

,	O
and	O
I	O
appreciated	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
skimp	O
on	O
the	O
pecans	FOOD
for	O
the	O
Turtle	FOOD

We	O
both	O
had	O

were	O

We	O
also	O
got	O
a	O

custard	FOOD
for	O
our	O
dog	FOOD
,	O
which	O
she	O
appeared	O
to	O
enjoy	O
.	O
I	O
guess	O
I	O
just	O
have	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
objections	O
that	O
keep	O
this	O
from	O
being	O
a	O
4-star	O
place	O
.	O
First	O
,	O
I	O
wish	O
they	O
had	O
more	O
flavors	O
,	O
since	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
always	O
want	O
a	O
sundae	FOOD
-LRB-	O
but	O
maybe	O
this	O
is	O
characteristic	O
of	O
frozen	O
custard	FOOD
joints	O
and	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
fair	O
criticism	O
-RRB-	O
.	O
Second	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
served	O
slightly	O
colder	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
melt	FOOD
as	O
fast	O
when	O
the	O
hot	O
fudge	FOOD
hits	O
it	O
.	O
Third	O
,	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
overpriced	O
for	O
a	O
fast	O
food-style	FOOD
place	O
.	O
This	O
is	O
especially	O
true	O
of	O
the	O
K9	O
custard	FOOD
,	O
since	O
we	O
're	O
used	O
to	O
getting	O
something	O
more	O
along	O
the	O

of	O
a	O
79-cent	O

up	O
with	O

Andrea	O
just	O

no	O

We	O
ordered	O
a	O

small	O

a	O

.	O
About	O
$	O
10.00	O

I	O
was	O

a	O

about	O
1/3	O

The	O

is	O
ok	O

nothing	O

Michael	O
's	O
is	O
quite	O
a	O

it	O
's	O
because	O
I	O

seriously	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
need	O
more	O
weighing	O
down	O
in	O
this	O

so	O
I	O
ordered	O
an	O
orange	FOOD
crush	FOOD
float	O
instead	O
.	O
For	O
something	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
cost	O
me	O
MAYBE	O
50cents	O
to	O
make	O
at	O
home	O

I	O
paid	O
close	O

$	O
5	O

a	O
12oz	O

.	O
That	O
is	O
ridiculous	O
.	O
In	O

,	O
I	O
think	O
their	O

are	O
pretty	O
steep	O
for	O
what	O
you	O

you	O
'd	O

not	O

I	O

thought	O
it	O
was	O
hilarious	O
how	O
