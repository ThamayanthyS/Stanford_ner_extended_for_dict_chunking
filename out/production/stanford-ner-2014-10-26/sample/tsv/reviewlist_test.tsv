could	O

there	O
more	O
than	O
I	O

Green	FOOD
	O
Lantern	O
is	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
place	O
that	O
comes	O
in	O
right	O
above	O
the	O

Line.	O
	O
What	O
I	O
mean	O
by	O
this	O

the	O
quality	O
of	O
the	O
meals	O

the	O
atmosphere	O
of	O
this	O
supper	FOOD
	O

not	O
to	O

	O
I'm	O
not	O
a	O
supper	FOOD
	O

kind	O
of	O
guy,	O
so	O
right	O
off	O
the	O
bat	FOOD
	O
a	O
place	O
like	O
the	O
Green	FOOD
	O
Lantern	O
isn't	O
going	O
to	O
be	O

	O
However	O
there	O
are	O
plenty	O
of	O
old	O
school	O

that	O
do	O
a	O

that	O
I've	O

no	O
qualms	O
tagging	O
along	O
for	O

	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O

	O
The	O
Green	FOOD
	O
My	O
friend,	O
however,	O
absolutely	O
loves	O
this	O
place.	O
	O
As	O
such	O
I've	O
had	O
cause	O
to	O
dine	O
here	O
many	O
times	O
over	O
the	O
years.	O
	O
There	O
are	O
quite	O
a	O
few	O
pluses.	O
	O
The	O
bartenders	O
are	O
quick	O
and	O
generally	O
friendly,	O
and	O
they've	O
got	O
an	O
adequate	O
tap	O
selection	O
including	O
Ale	FOOD
	O
Asylum	O
offerings.	O
	O
I	O
love	O
the	O
location	O
right	O
off	O
the	O
lake,	O
and	O
two-thirds	O
of	O
the	O
seating	O
areas	O
have	O
great	O
atmosphere.	O
	O
The	O
service	O
has	O
always	O
been	O
above	O
average	O
and	O
I	O
can't	O
think	O
of	O
a	O
bad	O
experience	O
-	O
this	O
type	O
of	O
consistency	O
over	O
the	O
years	O
is	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
maintain.	O
	O
They've	O
got	O
Wiggies,	O
which	O
are	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
low-rent	O
roesti	O
-	O
hashbrowns	O
with	O
onions	FOOD
,	O
peppers	O
and	O
American cheese	FOOD
.	O
	O
And	O
finally	O
the	O
Green	FOOD
	O
Lantern	O
is	O
obviously	O
popular	O
with	O
the	O
denizens	O
of	O
McFarland.	O
	O
I	O
don't	O
recall	O
a	O
single	O
trip	O
out	O
here	O
where	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
	O
wasn't	O
mostly	O
full	FOOD
	O
The	O
negatives:	O
first	O
and	O
foremost	O
I've	O
always	O
found	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
to	O
be	O
pretty	O
limited.	O
	O
I'm	O
not	O
big	O
on	O
fish	FOOD
	O

,	O
and	O
the	O
Green	FOOD
	O
Lantern's	O
Friday	O
night	O
menu	FOOD
	O
doesn't	O
have	O
much	O
else	O
aside	O
from	O
sandwiches	FOOD
	O
and	O
a	O
grilled	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
breast	FOOD
	O
entree.	O
	O
Now	O
as	O
I	O
said,	O
I'm	O
not	O
big	O
on	O
fish	FOOD
	O
fry	FOOD
	O
so	O
my	O
opinion	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
lightly,	O
but	O
the	O
times	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
ordered	O
the	O
fish	FOOD
	O
I've	O
been	O
underwhelmed.	O
	O
This	O
is	O
probably	O
just	O
me	O
-	O
my	O
friend	O
simply	O
can't	O
get	O
enough	O
of	O
the	O
stuff.	O
	O
Prices	O
are	O
moderately	O
high	O
for	O
the	O
perceived	O
quality,	O
though	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
	O
If	O
it	O
were	O
just	O
up	O
to	O
me	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
I'd	O
be	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
Green	FOOD
	O
Lantern	O
all	O
that	O
much.	O
	O
After	O
all,	O
I	O
don't	O
live	O

I	O
don't	O
really	O
go	O
for	O

	O
But	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
I	O
know	O

I'll	O
tag	O

have	O
a	O
decent	O
enough	O

	O
I	O
think	O
you'd	O
be	O
hard	O

to	O
at	O

be	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
at	O
the	O
Green	FOOD

several	O

the	O

are	O
a	O

thin,	O

I	O
do	O

that	O

too	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
one	O

we	O
just	O
took	O
a	O

Then	O
we	O

	O
Then	O
someone	O

said	O
hi.	O
	O
Then	O
we	O

The	O
menu	FOOD

the	O

the	O

The	O
Tuna	FOOD

the	O

that's	O
it.	O

	O
A	O

around	O
a	O
long	O

seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
local	O

That	O
struck	O
me	O
as	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
sign	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
Madison	O
almost	O
20	O
years	O
ago,	O
and	O
that	O
continues	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
case.	O
The	O
food	O
is	O
insipid,	O
blandly	O
spiced	O
to	O
appeal	O
to	O
unadventurous	O
midwestern	O
tastes	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
menu	FOOD
	O
reminiscent	O
of	O
the	O
Americanized	O
Chinese	O
palaces	O
of	O
the	O
1950s.	O
I	O
end	O
up	O
there	O
with	O
various	O
groups	O
on	O
occasion,	O
but	O
try	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
to	O
no	O
more	O
frequent	O
than	O
once	O
every	O
five	O
years	O
(more	O
frequently	O
in	O
my	O
first	O
years	O
in	O
Madison,	O
less	O
so	O
now).	O
It's	O
not	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
vastly	O
superior	O
authentic	O
Chinese	O
options	O
(although	O
I	O
prefer	O
P.	O
F.	O
Chang	FOOD
's,	O
recognizing	O
its	O
limitations),	O
but	O
one	O
does	O
better	O
with	O
other	O
Asian	O
options	O
when	O
in	O
Madison--particularly	O
Thai/Laotian,	O
but	O
also	O
Indian	FOOD
	O
(with	O
many	O
new	O
options	O
in	O
recent	O
years).It's	O
perhaps	O
the	O
closest	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
to	O
authetic	O
Chinese	O
food	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
like	O
Madison,	O
particularly	O
after	O
China	FOOD
	O

closed.	O
The	O
food	O
is	O
alright,	O
it's	O
been	O
embellished	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
appeal	O
to	O
an	O
American	O
audience,	O
but	O
at	O
least	O
the	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
My	O
real	O
problem	O
with	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
the	O
service:	O
The	O
menu	FOOD
	O
was	O
misinforming	O
and	O
didn't	O
specify	O
that	O
some	O
steamed	O
fish dish	FOOD
	O
was	O
a	O
filet	FOOD
	O
as	O
opposed	O
to	O
a	O
whole	O

I	O
politely	O
complained	O
to	O
the	O
waitress	O
about	O
my	O
order	O
not	O
being	O
accurate	O
and	O
she	O
informed	O
her	O
manager.	O
The	O
manager	O
only	O
ended	O
up	O
refunding	O
me	O
50%	O
off	O
the	O
item	O
ordered	O
and	O
began	O
telling	O
me	O
how	O
you	O
wouldn't	O

a	O
fancy	O

In	O

	O
The	O

was	O
so	O

that	O
I	O
had	O
to	O

	O
was	O

this	O

	O
travesty	O

	O
If	O

my	O

I	O

The	O

	O
Yay	O
for	O
Sundays.I	O
had	O
stopped	O
in	O
to	O
the	O
Prairie	O
Cafe	FOOD
	O
&	O
Bakery	O
several	O
times	O
since	O
it	O
opened	O
to	O
buy	O
scones	FOOD
	O
for	O
the	O
office,	O
and	O
I	O
hadn't	O
really	O
given	O
it	O
much	O
thought	O
beyond	O
this	O
purpose.	O
	O
I	O
really	O
liked	O
the	O
scones	FOOD
,	O
but	O
I	O
didn't	O
like	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
they	O
didn't	O
open	O
until	O
7	O
which	O
usually	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
bit	O
late.	O
	O
I	O
didn't	O
even	O
consider	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
more	O
than	O
bakery	O
goods,	O
and	O
every	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
stopped	O
the	O
place	O
seemed	O
empty.	O
	O
This	O
was	O
of	O
course	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
7:01	O
AM	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
person	O
through	O
the	O
door.	O
	O
So	O
this	O
weekend,	O
based	O
on	O
Chris	O
&	O
Kelly's	O
recommendations,	O
I	O
stopped	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
nice	O
leisurely	O
breakfast	FOOD
	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
taken	O
aback	O
by	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
inside.	O
	O
The	O
place	O
was	O
pleasantly	O
crowded,	O
with	O
the	O
warm	O
buzz	O
of	O
morning	O
conversations	O
and	O
a	O
relaxed	O
atmosphere.	O
	O
I	O
walked	O
up	O
and	O
ordered	O
the	O
breakfast	FOOD
	O
special	O
-	O
I	O
was	O
used	O
to	O
just	O
picking	O
out	O
scones	FOOD
	O
so	O
it	O
took	O
me	O
a	O
minute	O
to	O
get	O
my	O
bearings	O
and	O
find	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
board.	O
	O
The	O
price	O
was	O
OK,	O
not	O
under	O
$6	O
but	O
not	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
expected	O
anywhere	O
else.	O
	O
I	O
was	O
given	O
a	O
number	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
nice	O
table	O
along	O
the	O
bookshelves.	O
	O
I'd	O
never	O
really	O
taken	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
look	O
around	O
the	O
place	O
before,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
impressed	O
by	O
the	O
decor.	O
	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
cup	O
of	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
from	O
the	O
self-service	O
area,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
idea	O
-	O
I	O
love	O
diners	O
where	O
your	O
cup	O
is	O
constantly	O
refilled	O
but	O
I	O
tend	O
to	O
keep	O
drinking	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
there's	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
in	O
the	O
cup,	O
leading	O
to	O
the	O
over-caffienated	O
jitters.	O
	O
The	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
was	O
excellent,	O
truly	O
delicious	O
and	O
fair	O
trade	O
to	O
boot.	O
	O
I	O
savored	O
it	O
while	O
I	O
read	O
a	O
magazine	O
and	O
waited	O
on	O
my	O
breakfast	FOOD
	O
After	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
wait	O
the	O
breakfast	FOOD
	O
special	O
came	O
out.	O
	O
The	O
wait	O
wasn't	O
especially	O
long	O
considering	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
people	O
there,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
into	O
my	O
second	O
cup	O
of	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
my	O
food	O
came.	O
	O
It	O
was	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
fairly	O
large	O
plate,	O
so	O
my	O
first	O
impression	O
was	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
much	O
to	O
it,	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
mistake.	O
	O
The	O
special,	O
which	O
was	O
basically	O
a	O
Denver	O
scrambler,	O
was	O
completely	O
satisfying,	O
filling	O
but	O
not	O
heavy.	O
	O
The	O
wheat	FOOD
	O
toast	FOOD
	O
was	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
average	O

	O
you	O
get	O
with	O

,	O
quite	O
possibly	O
highlight	O

	O
I	O
was	O
pleasantly	O

by	O
the	O

	O
I	O
wasn't	O

His	O

was	O

I	O
stared	O
at	O
him	O
for	O
a	O

it	O

	O
It	O
went	O
on	O

really	O
made	O

it's	O

straight	O
off	O
the	O

this	O

not	O

(which	O

it	O

Fast food	FOOD
	O

I	O
must	O
say	O
this	O

really	O
was	O
quite	O

fresh	O

that	O
I	O
go	O
here	O

	O
I	O

the	O
last	O
time	O
I	O
ordered	O
this	O
it	O
came	O
sans	O

likely	O
due	O
to	O
the	O

	O

that	O

my	O

	O
My	O

was	O
suitably	O

with	O
the	O

but	O
he	O
thought	O
that	O
they	O

left	O
of	O
the	O
special	O
Hody	O
sauce	FOOD
.	O
	O
It	O
might	O
have	O
just	O
been	O
a	O
bad	O
day,	O
because	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
times	O
I've	O
been	O
here	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
problems.	O
	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
overall	O
quality	O
depends	O
on	O
the	O
day	O
you	O
stop	O
in.	O
	O
Some	O
of	O
the	O
bartenders	O
kind	O
of	O
throw	O
things	O
together,	O
while	O
others	O
take	O
their	O
time	O
and	O
do	O
a	O
decent	O
job.	O
	O
I	O
haven't	O
been	O
there	O
regularly	O
enough	O
to	O
establish	O
a	O

so	O
it's	O
been	O
hit	O
or	O
miss	O
for	O
me	O
lately.	O
	O
I've	O
also	O
tried	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
the	O

	O
and	O
the	O
onion	FOOD
	O
The	O
main	O
drawback	O
with	O
the	O
Hody	O
is	O
the	O
regular	O
crowd.	O
	O
On	O
Thursdays	O
when	O
Westside	O

a	O

of	O

some	O
dancing	O
to	O

some	O
sitting	O
at	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
	O
or	O
nearby	O
tables.	O
	O
Other	O
nights	O
the	O
crowd	O
can	O
get	O
a	O
bit	O
too	O
townie	O
for	O
my	O
liking.	O
	O
It	O
can	O
be	O
uncomfortable,	O
especially	O
when	O
half	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
	O
turns	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
you	O
when	O
you	O
walk	O
in.	O
	O
Sundays	O
can	O
be	O
the	O
worst.	O
	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
people	O
nearly	O
live	O
there.	O
	O
The	O
place	O
is	O
pretty	O
open	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
space,	O
but	O
it	O
still	O
can	O
get	O
quite	O
smoky.	O
	O
There	O
is	O
a	O
few	O
outdoor	O
tables	O
along	O
Elmwood,	O
and	O
these	O
are	O
perfect	O
for	O
a	O
weekend	O
afternoon.	O
	O
I	O
would	O
probably	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
Hody	O
more	O
if	O
it	O
weren't	O
for	O
the	O
small	O
inconsistencies	O
in	O
the	O
food	O
and	O
the	O
slight	O
hostile	O
feeling	O
that	O
I	O
sometimes	O
pick	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
regulars,	O
but	O
overall	O
the	O
Hody	O
is	O
a	O
reliably	O
good	O
time.They	O
have	O
decent	O
drink	O
specials.	O
However	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
	O
On	O
the	O
weekend	O
they	O
have	O
free	O
live	O

Its	O
usually	O

with	O
your	O

	O
Ive	O
never	O

	O
Overall	O
it	O
an	O
ok	O
place	O
to	O
go	O
to	O

a	O

Sadly	O
its	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
better	O

Its	O
a	O

they	O

the	O

	O
Anytime	O

however.	O
The	O

	O
I	O

	O
So	O
I	O
took	O
my	O

for	O
our	O

	O
We	O
were	O
extremely	O
underdressed	O
for	O
the	O
occasion.	O
	O
A	O
co-worker	O
had	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
fancier	O

casual	O
but	O
we	O
went	O
totally	O
casual	O
anyway.	O
	O
Good	O
news	O
is,	O
it	O
had	O
dim	O

	O
We	O
had	O
a	O

the	O

	O
and	O
were	O
quickly	O
seated.	O
	O
I'm	O
a	O

I	O
tried	O
a	O

	O
We	O
had	O
the	O

it	O
was	O
better	O

	O
The	O

were	O
good,	O
I	O
wouldn't	O

the	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
would	O

the	O

with	O
the	O
White chocolate	FOOD
	O

	O
	O
for	O

	O
It	O
was	O

I	O
would	O

this	O

I	O

to	O

which	O
was	O
a	O

nice	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
high	O
quality	O
restaurant	O
in	O
Middleton!	O
	O
We	O
will	O
definitely	O
be	O
back	O
again!My	O
Experience	O
at	O
Louisianne's	O
was	O
JUST	O
OK.	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
talk	O
about	O
this	O
place	O
so	O
I	O
gave	O
it	O
a	O
try.	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
night	O
by	O
myself	O
and	O
Sat	O
at	O
the	O
Bar	FOOD
.	O
Not	O
really	O
the	O
type	O
of	O
place	O
you	O
can	O
sit	O
at	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
.	O
	O
It's	O
very	O
small,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
television,	O
and	O
hardly	O
any	O
stools.	O
They	O
have	O
live	O
music	O
on	O
the	O
weekends	O
so	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
very	O
loud.	O
My	O
Bartender	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
behind	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
	O
and	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
pretty	O
busy.	O
So,	O
as	O
you	O
can	O
imagine	O
my	O
service	O
was	O
slow.	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
crab	FOOD
	O
puff	O
pastry	FOOD
	O
and	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
Shrimp	FOOD
	O
as	O
an	O
appetizer	FOOD
.	O
The	O
Crab	FOOD
	O
Pastry	FOOD
	O
was	O
very	O
good.	O
The	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
Shrimp	FOOD
	O
however	O
were	O
not.	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
they	O
left	O
the	O
shell	O
on	O
the	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
when	O
they	O
serve	O
it.	O
For	O
my	O
main	O
entree	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
Coffee	FOOD
	O
Crusted	O
Chicken	FOOD
	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
order	O
of	O
jambalaya	FOOD
.	O
They	O
wouldn't	O
let	O
me	O
have	O
jambalaya	FOOD
	O
as	O
a	O
side	O
so	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
order	O
half	O
a	O
plate	O
of	O
it	O
If	O
i	O
wanted	O
to	O
try	O
it.	O
The	O
Chicken	FOOD
	O
was	O
very	O
moist	O
and	O
flavorful.	O
	O
A	O
lot	O
sweeter	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
anticipated	O
but	O
good.	O
The	O
jambalaya	FOOD
	O
was	O
very	O
disappointing.	O
Overall,	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
ok.We	O
decided	O
to	O
sit	O
at	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
	O
and	O
have	O
our	O
dinner	FOOD
	O
there	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
listen	O
to	O
the	O
piano	O
player.	O
	O
We	O
waited	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
time	O
to	O
place	O
a	O
drink	O
order,	O
while	O
watching	O
the	O
bartender	O
stand	O
and	O
converse	O
with	O
other	O
patrons.	O
Then,	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
even	O
longer	O
wait	O
to	O
order	O
dinner	FOOD
.	O
	O
(empty	O
tables	O
all	O
over,	O
so	O
it	O
wasn't	O
due	O
to	O
being	O
busy)	O
	O
We	O
weren't	O
sure	O
who	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
us,	O
the	O
bartender	O
or	O
a	O
waitress.	O
	O
	O
The	O
bartender	O
took	O
our	O
drink	O
order	O
after	O
a	O
long	O
wait,	O
and	O
then	O
after	O
that,	O
finally	O
a	O
waitress	O
came	O
by	O
as	O
asked,	O
	O
"I	O
guess	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
hear	O
our	O
specials?"	O
	O
She	O
took	O
our	O
order	O
and	O
we	O
never	O
saw	O
her	O
again.	O
	O
Water	O
came	O
half	O
way	O
through	O
our	O
meal	FOOD
	O
from	O
the	O
bartender.	O
	O
Our	O
empty	O
plates	O
sat	O
on	O
our	O
table	O
for	O
25	O
minutes.	O
	O
We	O
felt	O
very	O
unattended	O
to	O
and	O
almost	O
a	O
bother	O
to	O
the	O
staff.	O
	O
The	O
food	O
is	O
excellent,	O
however,	O
and	O
that	O
just	O
makes	O
it	O
tolerable	O
to	O
go	O
there.	O
	O
It	O
is	O
not	O
an	O
inexpensive	O
place	O
to	O
eat,	O
and	O
it	O
feels	O
like	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
you	O
should	O
have	O
excellent	O
service.	O
	O

	O
I	O
didn't	O

the	O

that	O
the	O

	O
Rather	O
it	O
was	O
definitely	O
of	O

the	O

	O
The	O

	O
were	O
over	O

	O
The	O

	O
Everything	O

of	O

that	O
was	O
reminiscent	O
of	O

She	O
let	O
us	O

a	O
taste,	O

the	O

good.	O
	O
But	O
it	O
came	O
with	O
a	O
buerre	O

	O

	O
I'm	O

what	O

would	O
pair	O

just	O
like	O
my	O

it	O
was	O
clear	O
that	O
the	O

another	O

	O
was	O
a	O
dark chocolate	FOOD
	O
Really	O
I	O
think	O
this	O

deserves	O
2.5	O
stars,	O
but	O
Yelp	O
doesn't	O
do	O
half	O

so	O
I'll	O
be	O
generous.	O
	O
Lousiannes	O
clearly	O
has	O
a	O
loyal	O
customer	O
base	FOOD
	O
and	O
is	O
a	O
popular	O

	O
I	O
would	O
definitely	O
go	O
back	O
for	O
the	O
cocktails	O
and	O
even	O
the	O

	O
because	O
the	O
price	O
point	O
wasn't	O
outrageous	O
for	O
all	O
the	O

I	O
would	O

	O
If	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O

$30	O
for	O
an	O

I	O
expect	O
fresh	O

made	O

a	O
chef	FOOD
	O
that	O

	O
Madison	O
has	O
too	O
many	O

that	O

that's	O
what	O

my	O

ok	O
because	O
my	O
bar	FOOD
	O
for	O
New	O
Orleans	O
food	O
is	O
quite	O
insurmountable!	O
	O
But	O
I	O
give	O
honest	O
reviews.	O
	O
Whoever	O
is	O
in	O
the	O

	O
can	O
season	O
food	O

nobody's	O
business!	O
	O
It	O
is	O
great	O
food.	O
Seafood	FOOD
	O
was	O
not	O
fresh	O
though	O
and	O
they	O
really	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
Bread Pudding	FOOD
	O
on	O
the	O

!	O
	O
That	O
tells	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
chef	FOOD
	O
is	O
not	O
from	O
Louisiana	O
at	O
all.	O
	O
Prices	O
are	O
too	O
high,	O
way	O
to	O
high!	O
Jambalaya	FOOD
	O
for	O
$20!	O
	O
Ridiculous	O
really.	O
	O
A	O
pot	O
of	O
that	O
for	O
10	O

cost	O
$20.	O
	O
	O
But	O
if	O
you	O

great	O

good	O
food	O
that	O
is	O
just	O
seasoned	O
well,	O
go.	O
	O
Drinks	O
are	O
reasonable	O
and	O
service	O

fantastic.We	O
went	O
here	O
for	O
my	O
sister	O
in	O
law's	O
birthday.	O
I	O
was	O
anxious	O
because	O
my	O
last	O
time	O
here	O
was	O
so	O
unappealing,	O
but	O
this	O
time	O
was	O
a	O
whole	O
different	O
story!	O
We	O
ordered	O
four	O
appetizers	FOOD
	O
to	O
split	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
delicious.	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
steak	FOOD
	O
which	O
was	O
cooked	O
to	O
perfection.	O
The	O
service	O
was	O
excellent.	O
The	O
wine	FOOD
	O
We	O
wanted	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
special	O
date	FOOD
	O
I	O
give	O
the	O
atmosphere	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
a	O
solid	O
five	O
stars.	O
Although	O
it	O
has	O
an	O
rather	O
bland	O
looking	O
storefront,	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
is	O
anything	O
but.	O
You	O
walk	O
into	O
Louisianne's	O
and	O
immediately	O
head	O
downstairs.	O
It's	O
all	O
stone	O
and	O
looks	O
like	O
you're	O
walking	O
into	O
a	O
cool	O
cave	O
or	O
something.	O
It's	O
dark,	O
but	O
there's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
ambiance.	O
I've	O
been	O
to	O
New	O
Orleans,	O
and	O
it	O
definitely	O
has	O
that	O
sort	O
of	O
vibe	O
to	O
it.	O
It's	O
romantic,	O
fun,	O
and	O
not	O
what	O
you'd	O
expect	O
from	O
the	O
outside.	O
I	O
felt	O
like	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
vacation	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
there.	O
Also,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
live	O
jazz	O
band	O
playing	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
really	O
rocking.	O
It	O
was	O
awesome!	O
	O
We	O
went	O
at	O
about	O
8pm	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
night	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
about	O
ten	O
minutes	O
for	O
a	O
table,	O
which	O
was	O
fine.	O
While	O
we	O
waited,	O
we	O
ordered	O
drinks	O
at	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
	O
and	O
watched	O
the	O
band.	O
I	O
had	O
red	FOOD
	O
wine	FOOD
	O
We	O
were	O
seated	O
and	O
ordered	O
the	O
Pecan	FOOD
	O
Crab	FOOD
	O
Cakes	O
as	O
an	O
appetizer	FOOD
.	O
They	O
were	O
good,	O
probably	O
just	O
3	O
stars	O
though,	O
as	O
they	O
tasted	O
a	O
lot	O
like	O
other	O
Midwestern	O
crab	FOOD
	O
cakes	O
that	O
I've	O
had	O
before.	O
They	O
were	O
heavy	O
on	O
bread	FOOD
	O
and	O
light	FOOD
	O
on	O
crab	FOOD
...with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
Old	O
Bay	FOOD
	O
Next,	O
we	O
ordered	O
some	O
more	O
wine	FOOD
	O
and	O
our	O
entrees	O
(more	O
on	O
those	O
in	O
a	O

	O
We	O
were	O
given	O
a	O
choice	FOOD
	O
of	O
soup	FOOD
	O
or	O
salad	FOOD
	O
with	O
our	O
entrees	O
and	O
we	O
each	O
ordered	O
soup	FOOD
.	O
They	O
had	O
two	O
soups	O
of	O
the	O
day:	O
a	O
shrimp	FOOD
corn	FOOD
	O
chowder	FOOD
	O
(which	O
I	O
got),	O
and	O
a	O
tomato	FOOD
-based	O
pulled pork	FOOD
	O
stew	O
that	O
was	O
like	O
chilli	FOOD
	O
(which	O
my	O
husband	O
had).	O
Both	O
soups	O
were	O
fantastic!	O
Definitely	O
5	O
stars	O
for	O
the	O
soup	FOOD
	O
I'll	O
take	O
a	O
minute	O
here	O
to	O
comment	O
that	O
I	O
enjoy	O
going	O
to	O
traditional	O
restaurants	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time,	O
places	O
where	O
soup	FOOD
	O
salad	FOOD
	O
and	O
bread	FOOD
	O
are	O
included	O
with	O
your	O
meal	FOOD
	O
instead	O
of	O
everything	O
being	O
ala-cart.	O
(It	O
reminds	O
me	O
of	O
dining	O
in	O
Wisconsin	O
supper	FOOD
	O
clubs	O
as	O
a	O
child).	O
By	O
the	O
way,	O
the	O
bread	FOOD
	O
basket	O
was	O
delicious	O
and	O
was	O
quickly	O
replenished	O
by	O
the	O
waitress	O
after	O
we	O
ate	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
bread	FOOD
	O
within	O
30	O
seconds	O
of	O
sitting	O
down	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
warm	O
and	O
toasty	O
(and	O
served	O
with	O
soft	O
butter	FOOD
	O
Onto	O
the	O
entrees!	O
My	O
husband	O
absolutely	O
LOVED	O
his	O

He	O
claims	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
possibly	O
"the	O
best	O
thing	O
I've	O
ever	O
had	O
in	O
a	O

He	O
chose	O
the	O
Coffee	FOOD

Roasted	O

which	O
featured	O
a	O

with	O
a	O
coffee	FOOD
-crusted	O

chicken	FOOD
	O

,	O
in	O
a	O
hazelnut	FOOD
,	O
orange	FOOD
,	O
ricotta	FOOD
	O
sauce	FOOD
".	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
was	O
spinach	FOOD
	O
in	O
it	O
too.	O
The	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
was	O
perfectly	O
al dente	FOOD
,	O
the	O
grilled	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
moist,	O
and	O
the	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
was	O
rich	O
and	O
creamy.	O
It	O
almost	O
reminded	O
me	O
of	O
a	O
Thai	O
peanut	FOOD
	O
sauce	FOOD
,	O
but	O
with	O
hazelnuts	O
instead.	O
Although	O
it	O
sounded	O
like	O
something	O
that	O
could	O
become	O
cloyingly	O
sweet,	O
it	O
was	O
not.	O
It	O
had	O
a	O
nice	O
subtle	O
umami	O
essence	FOOD
	O
The	O
reason	O
that	O
Louisianne's	O
is	O
not	O
getting	O
a	O
five	O
star	O
review	O
from	O
me,	O
however,	O
is	O
due	O
to	O
my	O
entree,	O
which	O
I	O
felt	O
was	O
very	O
underwhelming.	O
We	O
don't	O
eat	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
at	O
home	O
for	O
health	O
reasons,	O
so	O
I	O
usually	O
get	O
it	O
when	O
we	O
go	O
somewhere	O
nice	O
as	O
a	O
special	O
treat.	O
I	O
chose	O
the	O
tasso	O
and	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
fettuccine	FOOD
	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
homemade	O
pasta	FOOD
,	O
and	O
because	O
it	O
featured	O
authentic	O
New	O
Orleans	O
style	O
ingredients	O
(for	O
the	O
unfamiliar,	O
tasso	O
is	O
basically	O
spicy	O
ham	FOOD
).	O
The	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
and	O
tasso	O
pieces	O
in	O
my	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
were	O
well-cooked,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
sparse.	O
The	O
dish	O
also	O
featured	O
mushrooms	FOOD
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
fabulous...probably	O
the	O
best	O
part.	O
However,	O
the	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
Creole	FOOD
	O
mustard	FOOD
	O
cream sauce	FOOD
",	O
and	O
it	O
didn't	O
really.	O
The	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
was	O
very	O
light	FOOD
,	O
and	O
had	O
little	O
flavor	FOOD
.	O
It	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
sad,	O
because	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
hoping	O
to	O
be	O
wowed	O
and	O
I	O
wasn't.	O
I'd	O
say	O
my	O
item	O
was	O
probably	O
3	O
stars,	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
awesome	O
if	O
only	O
the	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
The	O
service	O
was	O
adequate.	O
Nothing	O
remarkable	O
in	O
either	O
a	O
good	O
or	O
a	O
bad	O
way.	O
	O
Summary:	O
I'd	O
definitely	O
return.	O
I	O
think	O
Lousianne's	O
Etc.	O
is	O
a	O
decently	O
nice	O
restaurant	O
overall,	O
and	O
is	O
great	O
for	O
special	O
occasions.	O
Their	O
primary	O
issue,	O
from	O
both	O
my	O
own	O
experience	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
reviews	O
on	O
Yelp,	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
consistency.	O
Some	O
menu	FOOD
	O
items	O
are	O
fabulous,	O
and	O
others	O
are	O
meh.	O
The	O
major	O

that	O
we	O
probably	O

to	O

we	O

an	O

around	O
6:45	O

7:00.	O
	O
Odd,	O
the	O

was	O
empty...	O
but,	O
we	O
took	O
it	O
and	O
went	O

	O
We	O
ordered	O
some	O

	O

	O

the	O

	O
The	O

warned	O

that	O
the	O
curds	FOOD
	O
were	O
"standard-from-the-bag"	O

said	O
the	O

were	O

	O

the	O

	O

were	O

	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
the	O

was	O
hot	O
enough,	O
because	O
these	O
curds	FOOD
	O
were	O

	O

so	O

the	O

the	O

was	O

	O
It	O
really	O

	O
	O

if	O
the	O

was	O

the	O
drive	O

good.I	O
like	O
this	O
place	O
because	O
it	O
usually	O
isn't	O
very	O
crowded.	O
	O
There's	O
a	O

	O
The	O
burgers	O
are	O
really	O
good,	O
the	O
best	O
fast-food	O
burgers	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
(yes,	O
better	O
than	O
Culvers,	O
gasp),	O
and	O
the	O
fries	FOOD
	O
are	O
excellent	O
as	O
well.	O
	O
The	O
best	O
part	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
get	O
there	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
other	O
than	O
lunchtime,	O
you	O
get	O
fresh	O

	O
The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
don't	O
like	O
is	O
how	O
they	O
put	O
mayo	FOOD
	O
on	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
burgers,	O

they	O
never	O

	O
Service	O
is	O
always	O

but	O
sometimes	O
a	O
little	O
slow.	O
	O
Oh	O
yeah,	O
you	O
should	O
also	O
stay	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
The	O
decor	O
here	O
is	O
awesome,	O
with	O

straight	O
out	O

the	O

to	O

about	O
a	O
time	O
before	O

The	O
burgers	O
are	O
frozen	O

and	O
look	O
like	O
they're	O
right	O
from	O
Sysco.	O
The	O
reason	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
probably	O
saying	O
they're	O
so	O
good	O
is	O
because	O
the	O
patties	O
aren't	O

an	O

of	O
a	O

	O
The	O
Gritty	O
burgers	O
are	O
something	O
of	O
an	O
acquired	O
taste.	O
	O
They	O
taste	O
good	O
to	O
me	O
because	O
they	O
bring	O
back	O
memories	O
of	O
the	O
70s.	O
	O
	O
They	O
do	O
have	O
good	O

that	O

in	O
the	O
80s	O
sometime?	O
	O
	O
Correct	O
me	O
if	O
I'm	O
wrong.	O
	O
	O
We	O
did	O
think	O
the	O
burger	FOOD
	O
was	O
somewhat	O
different	O
from	O
what	O
we	O
remember.	O
	O
Now	O
we	O
know	O
why.	O
	O
The	O
old	O
burger	FOOD
We	O
think	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
enlarge	O
the	O
place	O
and	O
bring	O
back	O
the	O
original	O
burger	FOOD
	O
if	O
they	O

the	O

In	O
the	O
past,	O
NG's	O

a	O

	O
in	O

	O
A	O

	O
My	O

the	O
Campenelli	O

	O
It	O

	O
The	O

	O
The	O

as	O
quite	O
a	O

	O
It	O

that	O

the	O

with	O
more	O

one	O

	O
The	O

	O
(2	O

and	O
the	O

	O
was	O
very	O
good.	O
	O
Downsides	O
-	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
the	O

	O
could	O
have	O
used	O
more	O
finesse	O
in	O
the	O
seasoning	O
and	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
and	O
less	O
in	O
the	O
overall	O
amount,	O
they	O
were	O
tasty	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
just	O
pop	FOOD
	O
out	O
at	O
me.	O
	O
For	O
instance,	O
the	O
ravioli	FOOD
	O
was	O
great	O
-	O
good	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
and	O
sauce	FOOD
,	O
but	O
the	O
spinach	FOOD
	O
stuffing	O
was	O
just	O
bland.	O
	O
Nevertheless,	O
I	O
will	O
go	O
back	O
-	O
need	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
if	O
some	O
of	O
those	O

Salad	FOOD
	O
is	O

but	O
if	O
you	O

to	O
add	O
one	O
to	O
your	O

I	O
suggest	O
splitting	O
it.	O
The	O

the	O
lobby,	O
I	O
was	O
met	O
by	O
a	O
scene	O
of	O
dirty	O
tables,	O
slow	O
service,	O
and	O
a	O
floor	O
littered	O
with	O
a	O
surprising	O
ammount	O
of	O
plastic	O
gloves.	O
When	O
I	O
finally	O
made	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
counter,	O
I	O
was	O
amazed	O
to	O
learn	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
somehow	O
possible	O
to	O
take	O
my	O
order	O
without	O
saying	O
a	O
single	O
word	O
to	O
me,	O
and	O
then	O
simply	O
walking	O
away	O
without	O
even	O
handing	O
me	O
a	O
reciept.	O
Perhaps	O
it	O
was	O
this	O
same	O
top-notch	O
service	O
and	O
accuracy	O
that	O
caused	O
another	O
customer	O
there	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
not	O
once,	O
not	O
twice,	O
but	O
THREE	O
times	O
because	O
they	O
made	O
his	O
food	O
wrong.	O
At	O
this	O
point,	O
my	O
instincts	O
said	O
to	O
leave,	O
but	O
my	O
honor	O
required	O
that	O
I	O
stick	O
with	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
bitter	O
end.	O
But	O
when	O
I	O
finally	O
got	O
the	O
free	O
frapee,	O
I	O
was	O
saddened	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
wait.	O
If	O
you	O
value	O
your	O
ability	O
to	O
eat	O
at	O
Burger	FOOD
	O
King	FOOD
	O
more	O
than	O
your	O
time,	O
I	O
would	O
suggest	O
staying	O
in	O
your	O
car	O
at	O
this	O
location	O
and	O
living	O
in	O
blissful	O
ignorance.	O
As	O
for	O
me,	O
it'll	O
be	O
a	O
while	O
before	O
I	O
have	O
it	O
my	O
way	O
again.22	O
minutes	O

get	O
my	O

Terrible	O

I	O

the	O
only	O

placed	O
my	O

although	O
there	O

3	O

acceptable!	O
The	O
only	O
thing	O
keeping	O
this	O
from	O
getting	O
a	O
1-star	O

is	O
that	O
(1)	O

two	O

who	O

the	O

2	O

up	O

wiped	O
the	O

with	O
a	O

crumpled	O
it	O
up,	O
tossed	O

then	O
scooped	O
up	O

	O
without	O

his	O

At	O
that	O
point	O
I	O
walked	O
out	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
Culvers	O
where	O
I	O
ordered	O
and	O
got	O
my	O

in	O
less	O
time	O

I	O
spent	O
waiting	O
to	O

here.	O
	O
Not	O
even	O

went	O
through	O
the	O

through,	O
with	O
about	O
4	O
cars	O
ahead	O
of	O
me.	O
After	O
placing	O
my	O
order,	O
it	O
took	O
about	O
15	O
minutes	O
just	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
window,	O
where	O
I	O
then	O
waited	O
28	O
minutes	O
being	O
ignored!	O
I	O
know	O
the	O
exact	O
time	O
because	O
I	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O

on	O
my	O

There	O
were	O
at	O

three	O
cars	O
waiting	O
behind	O
me	O
too!	O
I	O
finally	O
got	O
the	O
attention	O
of	O
the	O
lady	O
inside	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
the	O
problem	O
was,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
told	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
"short	O
staffed"	O
and	O
they	O
make	O
the	O
food	O
fresh	O
to	O
order,	O
Which	O
I	O
guess	O
means	O
they	O
go	O
out	O
back	O
and	O
wait	O
for	O
the	O
chickens	FOOD
	O
to	O
mature,	O
slaughter	O
them,	O
and	O
THEN	O
make	O
the	O
nuggets!	O
I	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
manager,	O
when	O
she	O
finally	O
showed	O
up,	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
given	O
an	O
apology,	O
just	O
the	O
same	O
story	O
of	O
being	O
short	O
staffed.	O
At	O
this	O
point	O
I	O
had	O
asked	O
to	O
just	O
have	O
my	O
money	O
back	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
go	O
elsewhere	O
(still	O
no	O
food)	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
by	O
said	O
manager	O
that	O
she	O
doesn't	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
that....so	O
I	O
waited....and	O
finally	O
(28	O
minutes	O
later)	O
got	O
my	O
food,	O
which	O
was	O
cold,	O
and	O
my	O
milkshake	FOOD
	O
I	O
did	O
get	O
a	O

for	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
the	O

with	O
sadness	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
thirty	O
years.	O
	O
At	O
one	O
point,	O
they	O
actually	O
challenged	O
the	O
Clown	O
for	O
burger	FOOD
	O
...and	O
the	O
BK	O
at	O
this	O
location	O
is	O
a	O
perfect	O
example	O
of	O
why.	O
	O
EVERYTHING	O
at	O
this	O
BK	O
takes	O
ten	O

	O
Doesn't	O

what	O

does	O
the	O

If	O
I	O
want	O
BK,	O
I	O
actually	O
make	O
the	O

that	O

only	O
had	O
to	O

ten	O

these,	O
they	O
were	O
good	O
enough.	O

when	O
I	O

for	O
the	O

it's	O
good.	O
It's	O
a	O
little	O
greasy	O
sometimes,	O
I'll	O
admit.	O
But	O
honestly	O
I	O
get	O
the	O
craving	O
for	O

sometime!	O
They	O
have	O
great	O

I	O
said	O

if	O

I'd	O
go	O

wanted	O

I	O

A	O
young	O
man	O
was	O
seated	O
behind	O
the	O

greeted	O
us,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
get	O
up.	O
We	O
saw	O
the	O

an	O

was	O
a	O

on	O
the	O

ordered	O
a	O

he	O
said	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
out	O
of	O

	O
If	O
he	O
had,	O
we	O
probably	O
would	O
have	O
stayed	O

ordered	O
something	O

his	O
attitude	O
projected	O
total,	O
casual	O
indifference	O
in	O
serving	O
us	O

our	O

If	O

Sarah.	O
	O

	O
I	O

a	O

	O
When	O
the	O

it	O
reeked	O

	O
I'm	O
not	O

	O
The	O
Gyro	FOOD
	O
tasted	O
so	O
bad	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
spit	O
a	O

it	O

a	O

some	O

	O
would	O
like	O
this	O

Lots	O
of	O

you	O

the	O

you	O

it	O
was	O

We	O
sat	O
in	O
a	O

	O

went	O
to	O
this	O

at	O
8	O
pm	O
they	O
close	O
at	O
10pm	O
they	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
dark meat	FOOD
	O
in	O
crispy,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
mac	O

cheese	FOOD
	O
made.	O
	O
they	O
did	O
let	O
us	O
get	O
some	O
extra	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
because	O
we	O
wanted	O
three	O
sides	O
of	O

cheese	FOOD
Also,	O
another	O
customer	O
came	O
in	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
waiting	O
and	O
asked	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
prioritize	O
her	O
order	O
because	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
hurry.	O
They	O
said	O
yes,	O
but	O
it	O
resulted	O
in	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
confusion	O
between	O
employees	O
which	O
drastically	O
slowed	O
service	O
time.	O
The	O
customer	O
complained	O
about	O
the	O
wait,	O
which	O
resulted	O
in	O
an	O
indifferent	O
response	O
from	O
a	O
employee.	O
He	O
said	O
"if	O
you	O
wanted	O
your	O
order	O
faster	O
you	O
should	O
have	O
called	O
it	O
in".	O
He	O
said	O
this	O
with	O
an	O
attitude.	O
Then	O
he	O
turned	O
to	O
me	O
and	O
asked	O
if	O
I	O
thought	O
he	O
handled	O
that	O
correctly,	O

I	O
said	O
no.	O
In	O
the	O
end,	O

a	O

I	O
was	O

establishment.	O
The	O
crab	FOOD
	O
rangoon	O
was	O
piping	O
hot	O
and	O
filled	O
with	O
cheesy,	O
crab	FOOD
	O
The	O
hot	O
and	O
sour	O
soup	FOOD
	O
was	O
incredibly	O
substantial	O
with	O
tons	O
of	O
veggies	O
and	O

My	O

was	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O

I	O

recommend.	O
	O
The	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
People	O
are	O
nice.	O
Prices	O
are	O
good.	O
Food	O
is	O
huge,	O
and	O
tasty.	O
	O
If	O
I	O
didn't	O
live	O
on	O
the	O
West	O
side,	O
I'd	O
be	O
here	O
every	O
week.Best	O
Chinese	O
take-out	O
in	O
town.	O
They	O
have	O
the	O
best	O
pork	FOOD
	O
egg rolls	FOOD
But	O
I	O
think	O
all	O
Chinese	O
in	O
Madison	O
is	O
pretty	O
decent.	O
Nothing	O
has	O
truly	O
blown	O
me	O
away,	O
this	O
place	O
included.	O
While	O
staff	O
is	O
nice	O
and	O
carryout	O
is	O
quick,	O
food	O
I	O
ordered	O
(veggie	O
fried rice	FOOD
	O
and	O
Mongolian	O
chicken	FOOD
)	O
just	O
didn't	O
have	O
much	O
flavor	FOOD
.	O
Like	O
at	O
all.	O
The	O
menu	FOOD
	O
is	O
extensive,	O
though,	O
and	O
maybe	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
head	O
back	O
there	O
to	O
try	O
more	O
of	O
it?	O
They	O
make	O
a	O
big	O
claim	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
see	O
it	O
on	O
their	O
menu	FOOD
	O
they'll	O
find	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
make	O
it,	O
however	O
that	O
didn't	O
hold	O
true	O
when	O
I	O
asked	O
about	O
Cantonese	O
pan	FOOD
	O
fried	O
noodles	FOOD
...	O
an	O
item	O
that	O
seems	O
near	O
impossible	O
to	O
find	O
in	O
this	O
town.Although	O
the	O
staff	O
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
the	O
language	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
barrier	O
for	O
me	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
others,	O
the	O
food	O
I	O
got	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
good.	O
After	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
General Tso's Chicken	FOOD
,	O
the	O
woman	O
turned	O
on	O
the	O
fryer	O
and,	O
without	O
waiting	O
for	O
the	O
oil	O
to	O
heat	FOOD
	O
up,	O
she	O
put	O
in	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
and	O
my	O
crab	FOOD
	O
rangoon.	O
Therefore,	O
when	O
I	O
ate	O
the	O
food	O
it	O
wasn't	O
crispy	O
as	O
a	O
good	O
General	O
Tso's	O
crab	FOOD
	O
rangoon	O
	O
should	O
be.	O
Another	O
thing	O
that	O
I	O
noticed	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
that	O
she	O
put	O
in	O
the	O
fryer	O
was	O
sitting	O
on	O
the	O
counter	O
in	O
the	O
heat	FOOD
.	O
*note:	O
she	O
hadn't	O
fried	O
any	O
in	O
quite	O
some	O
time	O
which	O
is	O
why	O
she	O
had	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O
fryer	O
on.	O
The	O
person	O
that	O
said	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
too	O
sweet	O
was	O
right.	O
Even	O
though	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
said	O
*spicy	O
for	O
my	O
meal	FOOD
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
"zip"	O
at	O
all.	O
Take	O
it	O
for	O
what	O
it's	O
worth,	O
but	O
I	O
know	O
I	O
will	O
be	O
looking	O
for	O
another	O
restaurant	O
to	O
get	O
my	O
take	O

If	O
you	O

	O
I	O

to	O
the	O

past	O
this	O

It	O
doesn't	O
have	O
much	O
curb	O
appeal	O
but	O
	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
to	O
check	O
it	O
out	O
anyways,	O
the	O
pictures	O
inside	O
were	O
nice	O
and	O
the	O
people	O
are	O
friendly	O
and	O
the	O
lady	O
even	O
gave	O
me	O
free	O
wontons	O
since	O
it	O
was	O
my	O

it	O
was	O
a	O

	O
Sometimes	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
they	O
didn't	O

the	O

when	O

Yeah,	O
I	O

too	O
(and	O
a	O

	O
(minus	O

up	O

up	O

After	O
that	O
the	O

in	O
Fitchburg.I	O
didn't	O
think	O
the	O
meal	FOOD
	O
was	O
spectacular	O

it	O
was	O
fast.	O
I	O
love	O
the	O

chips	FOOD
	O
they	O
put	O
out	O
and	O
the	O
at	O

I	O
think	O
in	O
the	O
evening,	O
it	O
sounds	O
like	O
a	O
fun	O
place	O

we	O
came	O

-	O
food	O
is	O
only	O
average	O
	O
Tonight	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
chimichangas.	O
Instead	O
of	O
one	O
big	O
one,	O
you	O
get	O
two	O
smaller	O
ones.	O
Since	O
you	O
get	O
two	O
and	O
your	O
choice	FOOD
	O
of	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
or	O
beef	FOOD
	O
They	O
brought	O
my	O
platter,	O
and	O
after	O
I	O
took	O
a	O
bite	O
of	O
beans	FOOD
	O
A	O
waste,	O
because	O
it	O
wasn't	O
really	O
that	O
big	O
of	O
a	O
deal	O
if	O
they'd	O
brought	O
me	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
same;	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
price	O
difference	O
and	O
I	O
wasn't	O
dead	O
set	O
on	O
having	O
one	O
of	O
each.	O
	O
As	O
it	O
turns	O
out,	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
had	O
originally	O
given	O
me	O
what	O
I	O
asked	O
for	O
and	O
took	O
it	O
away,	O
because	O
my	O
replacement	O
plate	O
was	O
two	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
*Their	O
idea	O
of	O
chimichangas	O
are	O
really	O
just	O
bigger-than-average	O
flautas;	O
they	O
were	O
open-ended	O
and	O
have	O
no	O
filling	O
aside	O
from	O
the	O
meat	FOOD
	O
Other	O
blips	O
in	O
service:	O
-	O
served	O
everyone	O
but	O
one	O
person	O
at	O
the	O
table,	O
and	O
took	O
forever	O
to	O
finally	O
bring	O
them	O
their	O
food	O
soup	FOOD
-	O
we	O
had	O
three	O
kids	O
with	O
our	O
group	FOOD
,	O
and	O
their	O
parents	O
explained	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
split	O
a	O
meal	FOOD
	O
So,	O
yeah.	O
The	O
food	O
there	O
is	O
fine,	O
but	O
the	O
atmosphere	O
(dark)	O
and	O
service	O
(lacking)	O
make	O
it	O
pretty	O
low	O
on	O
my	O
list	O
of	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
places	O
in	O
Madison.There	O
really	O
aren't	O
	O
many	O
places	O
to	O
eat	O
in	O
Madison	O
as	O
other	O
reviews	O
have	O
stated.	O
Being	O
from	O
NY	O
it	O
really	O
did	O
seem	O
like	O
a	O
no	O
mans	O
land,	O
so	O
thankfully	O
Yelp	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
rescue.	O
We	O
went	O
to	O
Laredo's	O
and	O
got	O
carne asada	FOOD
,	O
nachos	FOOD
	O
with	O
chicken	FOOD
,	O
chimichanga	FOOD
's,and	O
churros.	O
It	O
wasn't	O
the	O
greatest	O
but	O
it	O
wasn't	O
the	O
worst	O
thing	O
in	O
the	O
world.	O
We	O
only	O
got	O
our	O
food	O
to	O
take-out	O
so	O
I	O
don't	O
really	O
know	O
about	O
there	O
wait	O
staff	O
or	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
.	O
We	O
got	O
our	O
food	O
pretty	O
quickly	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
hot	O
but	O
not	O
really	O
well	O
packaged.	O
When	O
we	O
got	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
hotel	O
some	O
	O
of	O
packages	O
where	O
leaking,	O
it	O
was	O
annoying	O
but	O
didn't	O
effect	O
the	O
taste.	O
All	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
good	O
and	O
has	O
something	O
familiar	O
about	O
it.	O
If	O
your	O
in	O
Madison,WI	O
and	O
are	O
looking	O
for	O
decent	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
then	O
try	O
Laredo's.I	O
think	O
Laredo's	O
has	O
the	O
best	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
food	O
in	O
Madison.	O
I	O
really	O
like	O
their	O
salsa	FOOD
	O
and	O
guacamole	FOOD
.	O
They	O
have	O
great	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
enchiladas	FOOD
	O
too.	O
Their	O
margaritas	FOOD
	O
are	O
really	O
tasty	O
too:-)	O
I	O
recommend	O
going	O
to	O
eat	O
here.I	O
have	O
to	O
admit	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
surprised	O
in	O
that	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
actually	O
pretty	O
good.	O
	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
why	O
I	O
was	O
expecting	O
otherwise.	O
	O
I	O
guess	O
because	O
from	O
the	O
outside	O
it	O
just	O
looks	O
like	O
your	O
standard	O
cookie cutter	FOOD
	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
veggie	O
fajita	FOOD
	O
that	O
came	O
out,	O
as	O
it	O
should,	O
sizzling	O
on	O
a	O
cast	O
iron	FOOD
	O
skillet	FOOD
.	O
	O
The	O
veggies	O
were	O
well	O
prepared	O
and	O
flavorful,	O
as	O
were	O
the	O
beans	FOOD
	O
and	O
rice	FOOD
	O
The	O
only	O
complaint	O
I	O
have	O
is	O
with	O
the	O
horchata	FOOD
	O
I	O
drank.	O
	O
It	O
tasted	O
OK,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
rich.	O
	O
Like	O
they	O
ran	O
low	O
on	O
rice	FOOD
	O
milk	FOOD
	O
and	O
supplemented	O
with	O
cow	FOOD
	O
milk	FOOD
	O
I	O
guess	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
taken	O
our	O
clues	O
form	O
the	O
emptiness	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
and	O
the	O
fact	O
happy	O
our	O
lasted	O
until	O
closing....	O
The	O
margarita	FOOD
	O
was	O
a	O
sickly	O
peach	FOOD
	O
color	FOOD
The	O
plates	O
were	O
served	O
with	O
the	O
thumb	O
of	O
a	O
dirty	O
oven	O
mitt	O
in	O
the	O
food	O
(I'm	O
guessing	O
they	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
microwave	FOOD
The	O
enchiladas	FOOD
	O
were	O
slimy	O
and	O
water-logged	O
covered	O
in	O
a	O
dilute,	O
flavorless	O
mole	FOOD
The	O

	O
with	O
a	O

The	O

one	O

those	O
disinterested	O
"howseverythinggoingeverythingokay"	O
before	O
we	O
flagged	O
him	O

We	O
declined	O

just	O
received	O
a	O

for	O
the	O

the	O

for	O

Never	O

most	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
pretty	O
standard,	O
however	O
the	O
dumplings	FOOD
	O
are	O
fantastic,	O
they're	O
all	O
I	O
order	O
now.No	O
vegetarian	O
options,	O
and	O
staff	O
always	O
too	O
busy	O
and	O
not	O
personable.The	O
great	O
thing	O
about	O
China	FOOD
	O
Wok	FOOD
	O
is	O
it	O
is	O
exactly	O
what	O
you'd	O
expect.	O
It's	O
your	O
decent,	O
standard	O
Americanized	O
Chinese	O
fare.	O
I've	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
bad	O
experience;	O
it's	O
always	O
the	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
close	O
by	O
me,	O
so	O
delivery	O
is	O
always	O
super	O
fast.	O
Although	O
the	O
food	O
is	O
generally	O
nothing	O
special,	O
the	O
fried	O
dumplings	FOOD
	O
hold	O
an	O
especially,	O
soft,	O
doughy	O
spot	FOOD
	O
in	O
my	O
heart.This	O
is	O
our	O
"go-to"	O
Chinese	O
restaurant	O
on	O
the	O
North	O

It's	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
knock	O
your	O
socks	O
off	O

anything	O
but	O
it's	O
by	O
far	O
the	O
best	O
in	O
the	O
area	O
in	O
this	O
price	O
range.	O
The	O
food	O
is	O
not	O
super	O
greasy	O
or	O
full	FOOD
	O
They	O
are	O
not	O
overly	O
helpful	O

in	O
the	O
many	O
times	O
we've	O
ordered	O

6	O
years),	O
they've	O
never	O

the	O

I	O
see	O
that	O
some	O
people	O
say	O
there	O
aren't	O
veggie	O
options	O
but	O
as	O
a	O
family	O
that	O
is	O
primarily	O
vegetarian,	O
they've	O
substituted	O
tofu	FOOD
	O
in	O
every	O

And	O
will	O
make	O
just	O
about	O

They	O
may	O

appear	O
to	O

	O
The	O

was	O
great....kind	O
of	O
a	O
wait,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
really	O
busy.	O
	O
Throughout	O
the	O
meal	FOOD
	O
we	O
were	O
serenaded	O
with	O
Buffett	O
favorites	O
by	O
a	O
guy	O
on	O
guitar.	O
	O
Worth	O
eating	O
there	O
once,	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
kitschy	O
to	O
appeal	O
to	O
me	O
on	O
a	O
regular	O
basis.	O
3	O

there	O
once,	O

short	O
of	O
being	O
annoyed	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
silly,	O
wannabe	O
island	O
retreat	O
crap,	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
average,	O
overpriced,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O

winter,	O
so	O
who	O
wants	O
to	O
be	O
reminded	O
that	O
it's	O
3	O
freaking	O
degrees	O
outside.	O
	O
Actually,	O
the	O
biggest	O
problem	O
I	O
had	O
with	O
this	O

was	O
the	O
extravagant	O
price	O
for	O
the	O

	O

better	O

	O
in	O
theory,	O
but	O
the	O
colorful	O

are	O
little	O
compensation	O

was	O

	O
Jimmy	O

	O
was	O
playing	O
constantly	O
over	O

system	O
and	O
our	O
service	O
was	O
quick	O
and	O
friendly	O
like	O
any	O

restaurant.	O
The	O

	O
were	O
OVERPRICED	O

the	O

	O

my	O

(Pescetarians	O

at	O
times	O
uncommon	O
for	O
Wisconsin.)Staff	O
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
service	O
was	O
fairly	O
prompt.	O
The	O
food	O
was	O
merely	O
average	O
and	O
the	O
"specially	O
brewed"	O
beer	FOOD
	O
Overall,	O
the	O
place	O
tries	O
too	O
hard	O
with	O
its	O
theme.	O
The	O
weather	O
was	O
not	O
cooperating,	O
but	O
they	O
still	O
had	O
the	O
doors	O
wide	O
open.	O
This	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
better	O
day	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
doors	O
down	O
and	O
keep	O
the	O
diners	O
inside.	O
The	O
county	O
was	O
under	O
a	O
tornado	O
watch	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
and	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
severe	O
storms	O
in	O
the	O
vicinity.	O
Not	O
a	O
day	O
to	O
encourage	O
diners	O
to	O
eat	O
on	O
the	O
patio.So,	O
when	O
I	O
first	O
heard	O
of	O
Cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
in	O
Paradise,	O
my	O
reaction	O
was	O
"oh	O
no,	O
that's	O
totally	O
lame,	O
I'll	O
never	O
go	O
there	O
to	O
eat	O
beef	FOOD
	O
among	O
tiki	O
torches."	O
	O
Then	O
I	O
learned	O
from	O
my	O
Gluten	FOOD
	O
Free	O
Restaurant	O
Guide	O
by	O
Triumph	O
Dining	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
gluten	FOOD
-free	O
menu	FOOD
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
were	O
nearby	O
when	O
my	O
father	O
announced	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
hungry	O
for	O
a	O
burger	FOOD
	O
and	O
fries	FOOD
.	O
	O
And	O
that's	O
how	O
we	O
ended	O
up	O
at	O
Cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
We	O
enjoyed	O
our	O
bun	FOOD
-less	O
burgers	O
and	O
gluten	FOOD
-free	O
french fries	FOOD
	O
(fried	O
in	O
a	O

	O
The	O
non-alcoholic	O
"tropical"	O

selection	O
had	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
maybe	O
10	O
drinks	O
and	O
they	O
all	O
sounded	O
good.	O
	O
I	O
had	O
an	O

	O
complemented	O
with	O

a	O

	O
We	O
ordered	O
a	O
quesadilla	O
appetizer	FOOD
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
tasty.	O
	O
There	O
was	O
plenty	O
of	O
chicken	FOOD
,	O
cheese	FOOD
,	O
and	O
vegetables	FOOD
	O
between	O
the	O

	O
We	O
decided	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
both	O
order	O
something	O
different	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
share	O
and	O
try	O
other	O
foods	O
on	O
the	O

	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
"El	O

a	O
traditional	O

	O
all	O
pressed	O

two	O

.	O
	O
It	O
was	O
average	O
at	O
best.	O
	O
My	O
friend	O
ordered	O
the	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
Cheddar	FOOD
	O
Burger	FOOD
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
excellent.	O
	O
The	O

	O
is	O
just	O
as	O
it	O
sounds,	O
consisting	O
of	O

.	O
	O
He	O
gave	O
me	O
half	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
I	O
ordered.	O
	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
even	O
finish	O
my	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
Cuban.	O
	O
My	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
did	O
come	O
with	O
sweet potato	FOOD
	O
chips	FOOD
	O
which	O
were	O
pretty	O
good.	O
	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
usually	O
a	O
fan	O
of	O
sweet potato	FOOD
	O
but	O
found	O
myself	O
munching	O
on	O
these	O
chips	FOOD
	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
much	O
about	O
Jimmy	O
Buffett,	O
but	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
actually	O
the	O
title	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
songs.	O
	O
There	O
are	O
38	O
locations	O
in	O
17	O
states,	O
all	O
in	O
places	O
very	O
far	O
from	O
Hawaii.	O
	O
Maybe	O
it	O
isn't	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
Hawaii,	O
but	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
it	O
looks	O
like	O
what	O
Hawaii	O
might	O
be	O
envisioned	O
by	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
never	O
been.	O
	O
There	O
was	O
no	O
version	O
of	O
the	O
burger	FOOD
	O
made	O
with	O
pineapple	FOOD
	O
slices	O
and	O
teriyaki	FOOD
	O
sauce	FOOD
...but	O
maybe	O
that's	O
because	O
Buffett	O
supposedly	O
wrote	O
Cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
in	O
Paradise"	O
in	O
the	O
Carribbean...which	O
changes	O
everything.	O
	O
Maybe	O
that's	O
why	O
they	O
serve	O
the	O
Cubano	FOOD
	O
Overall,	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
satisfactory.	O
	O
If	O
I	O
am	O
ever	O
in	O
town	O
again	O
or	O
happen	O
to	O
pass	O
by	O
a	O
Cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
in	O
Paradise,	O
I	O
might	O
go	O
back	O
because	O
the	O
drinks	O
are	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
burgers	O
are	O
yummy.	O
	O
It	O
is	O
a	O
decent	O
meal	FOOD
	O
that	O
won't	O
break	O
your	O
wallet,	O
but	O
take	O
a	O
hint	O
by	O
the	O
restaurant's	O
name	O
and	O
order	O
a	O
cheeseburger	FOOD
Sorry	O
to	O
say,	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
a	O
disaster.	O
Not	O
because	O
the	O
decor	O
is	O
cheesy,	O
but	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
mind	O
numbingly	O
slow,	O
and	O
the	O
food	O
is	O
uber-forgettable.	O
We	O
called	O
ahead	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
a	O
table	O
for	O
16	O
on	O
the	O
patio,	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
there	O
at	O
our	O
appointed	O
time	O
nothing	O
was	O
ready	O
-	O
bad	O
first	O
impression.	O
We	O
were	O
sat	O
at	O
four	O
different	O
tables	O
near	O
each	O

and	O
moved	O
the	O
tables	O
ourselves	O
to	O
create	O
a	O
configuration	O
where	O
our	O
group	FOOD
The	O
waitress	O
asked	O
a	O
couple	O
times	O
if	O
anyone	O
needed	O
anything,	O
but	O
great	O
service	O
starts	O
with	O
keeping	O
water	O
glasses	FOOD
	O
full	FOOD
The	O
food	O
was	O
cold,	O
overcooked,	O
tasteless	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
scary.	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
spicy	O
burger	FOOD
The	O
only	O
way	O
I	O
would	O
eat	O
at	O
this	O
chain	O
again	O
would	O
be	O
if	O
I	O
washed	O
up	O
on	O
a	O
beach	O
after	O
being	O
marooned	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
giving	O
the	O
food	O
away	O
FREE.During	O
a	O
business	O
trip	O
in	O
Madison,	O
we	O
scoped	O
out	O
some	O
places	O
to	O
do	O
dinner	FOOD
	O
afterwards.	O
After	O
browsing	O
a	O
few	O

menus	FOOD
	O
and	O
seeing	O
that	O
this	O

had	O
pitchers	O
of	O
Sangria	FOOD
	O
The	O
experience	O
here	O
was	O
pretty	O
middle-of-the-road.	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
weeknight,	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
crowded,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
problem	O
getting	O
seated	O
right	O
away.	O
	O
While	O
the	O
decor	O
and	O
the	O
environment	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
much	O
to	O
stomach,	O
I	O
honestly	O
enjoyed	O
my	O
cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
and	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
out	O

We	O

	O
There	O
were	O

	O
There	O
was	O
one	O

who	O
was	O
bothered	O
to	O
make	O
drinks.	O
	O
We	O
watched	O
him	O
make	O
a	O
moijto	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
poured	O
from	O
the	O
shaker	O
to	O

	O
he	O
spilled	O
some	O

some	O

	O
that	O
went	O
onto	O

he	O
picked	O
them	O
up	O
and	O
put	O
them	O
back	O
into	O
the	O

	O
DISGUSTING!	O
Then	O
the	O
4	O

us	O
at	O
the	O

	O
were	O
ready	O
to	O

the	O

went	O
MIA,	O
we	O
waved	O

we	O
never	O

10	O

he	O

when	O

this	O

nothing	O

we'd	O
definitely	O
go	O

	O
Its	O

(most	O

	O
	O
Every	O

	O

	O
	O
The	O

Our	O

yesterday	O
were	O
about	O
10	O

	O

and	O
just	O

that	O
should	O

	O
	O
The	O
meat	FOOD
	O
didn't	O
have	O
any	O
distinctive	O

	O
and	O
was	O
rather	O
skimpy,	O
the	O

	O
was	O
not	O
complimentary	O
to	O
the	O

	O
and	O
the	O

	O
was	O
generally	O
regular	O
too.	O
	O
	O
At	O
least	O
the	O
bun	FOOD
I	O
would	O
only	O
recommend	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
my	O
Republican	O

because	O
they	O
have	O
no	O
ability	O
to	O

might	O

a	O

insisted	O
we	O
meet	O
up	O
there	O
for	O
dinner	FOOD

	O
First	O
thing	O
I	O
noticed	O
was	O
the	O
dirty	O
fork	FOOD
	O
in	O
my	O
silverware	O
set.	O
	O
It	O
had	O
definitely	O
gone	O
through	O
a	O
dishwasher,	O
which	O
baked	O
on	O
a	O
nice	O
chunk	FOOD
	O
of	O
food	O
from	O
the	O
previous	O
user.	O
	O
Pointed	O
it	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
waiter	O
who	O
just	O
swapped	O
out	O
my	O
silverware	O
set	O
with	O
some	O
from	O
a	O
nearby	O
table.	O
	O
After	O
that,	O
I	O
needed	O
a	O
drink.	O
	O
Ordered	O
a	O
Bud	O
Light	FOOD
	O
Lime	FOOD
	O
since	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
huge	O
banner	O
that	O
said	O
$2.50	O
for	O
that	O
brand	O
all	O
during	O
May.	O
	O
Nope,	O
they	O
were	O
out	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	O
said	O
we	O
could	O
NOT	O
substitute	O
for	O
another	O
drink	O
(i.e.	O
a	O
Corona	O
or	O
something	O
similar).	O
	O
Ok	O
then,	O
I'll	O
just	O
order	O
a	O
$9.39	O
mushroom	FOOD
	O
and	O
swiss.	O
	O
Food	O
came	O
and	O
the	O
fries	FOOD
	O
were	O
cold.	O
	O
Told	O
the	O
waiter	O
we	O
wanted	O
new	O
fries	FOOD
	O
and	O
he	O
obliged.	O
	O
The	O
burger	FOOD
	O
was	O
nothing	O
special.	O
	O
Should	O
have	O
been	O
half	O
the	O
price	O
we	O
paid.	O
	O
Then,	O
after	O
I'm	O
half	O
way	O
done	O
with	O
the	O
burger	FOOD
,	O
the	O
waiter	O
returns	O
and	O
says	O
he	O
checked	O
with	O
the	O
manager	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
a	O
Corona	O
for	O
$2.50.	O
	O
Too	O
late.	O
	O
By	O
this	O
time,	O
I	O
just	O
wanted	O
to	O
leave.	O
	O
The	O
place	O
was	O
not	O
busy	O
at	O
all,	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
what	O
took	O
him	O
so	O
long	O
to	O
check	O
with	O
the	O
manager	O
about	O
that.	O
	O
I	O
hate	O
these	O
theme	O
restaurants	O
and	O
this	O
trip	O
just	O
served	O
to	O
solidify	O
my	O
beliefs	O
that	O
gimmicky	O
restaurants	O
usually	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
good	O
food.	O
	O
I'll	O
stick	O
with	O
5	O

when	O
I	O
want	O
a	O
good	O

	O
Hell,	O
just	O
go	O
next	O
door	O
to	O
TGIFridays,	O
even	O
they	O
beat	FOOD
	O
this	O
place.What	O
you're	O
really	O
doing	O
is	O
playing	O
for	O
the	O
experience.	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
mini	O
crab	FOOD
	O
burgers	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
good.	O
The	O
drinks	O
are	O
good,	O
but	O
overpriced.	O
Service	O
was	O
mediocre.OK,	O
I	O
must	O
start	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
the	O
kids	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
here	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
that	O
excited	O
about	O
it.	O
	O
	O
However,	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
by	O
the	O
reasonable	O
beer	FOOD
	O
selection	O
and	O
the	O
nice	O
menu	FOOD
	O
The	O
big	O
problem	O
with	O
Cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
was	O
the	O
service.	O
	O
We	O
thought	O
our	O
waiter	O
had	O
a	O
job	O
at	O
a	O
restaurant	O
across	O
town!	O
	O
He	O
would	O
disappear	O
for	O
long	O
periods	O
of	O
time	O
(could	O
not	O
see	O
him	O
anywhere	O
in	O
the	O
restaurant)	O
and	O
then	O
reappear	O
maybe	O
15-20	O
minutes	O
later.	O
	O
Order	O
food,	O
where	O
did	O
he	O
go?	O
Order	O
a	O

where	O
did	O
he	O
go?	O
	O
Finish	O

wait	O
15	O
minutes	O
for	O
the	O
check.	O
	O
Try	O
to	O
pay	O
the	O
check,	O
he	O

off	O
for	O

15	O
minutes	O
with	O

	O
Not	O

even	O
though	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
fine.Greasy	O
food,	O
lazy	O
service,	O
flat	O
soda.	O
	O
For	O
a	O
place	O
the	O
is	O
supposed	O
to	O
specialize	O
in	O
burgers	O
they	O
sucked!	O
	O
The	O
patty	FOOD
	O
was	O
dry	O
and	O
over	O
cooked	O
everything	O
was	O
greasy,	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
was	O
ok	O
were	O
the	O
fries	FOOD
	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
reason	O
to	O
go.Service	O
and	O
fries	FOOD
	O
are	O
	O
where	O
they	O
excel.	O
	O
We	O
have	O
been	O
there	O
5	O
or	O
6	O
times	O
and	O
that's	O
what	O
stands	O
out.	O
	O
I	O
like	O
their	O
burgers	O
but	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
First	O
time	O
there	O
the	O
service	O
was	O
fast,	O
which	O
is	O
nice	O
because	O
I	O
only	O
have	O
a	O
50	O
minute	O
lunch	FOOD
	O
break,	O
and	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
OK.	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
Guacamole	FOOD
	O
Bacon	FOOD
	O
burger	FOOD
.	O
It	O
was	O
tasty	O
but	O
the	O
burger	FOOD
	O
itself	O
was	O
overly	O
greasy.	O
The	O
toppings	O
were	O
very	O
good	O
though	O
so	O
that	O
saved	O
the	O
burger	FOOD
	O
Second	O
time	O
there	O
had	O
the	O
bigger	O
issues.	O
Again	O
we're	O
on	O
a	O
shorter	O
lunch	FOOD
	O
and	O
usually	O
they	O
accommodate	O
well.	O
We	O
didn't	O
have	O
anybody	O
come	O
to	O
our	O
table	O
for	O
drink	O
orders	O
for	O
over	O
10	O
minutes.	O
2	O
tables	O
came	O
in	O
after	O
us	O
and	O
got	O
drinks	O
and	O
ordered	O
food	O
before	O
us.	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
annoying	O
considering	O
the	O
place	O
wasn't	O
that	O
busy	O
when	O
we	O
sat	O
down.	O
Again	O
the	O
good	O
was	O
OK.	O
This	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
Sweet	O
Fire	O
Chicken	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
better	O
tasting	O
than	O
the	O
burger	FOOD
	O
I	O
had	O
but	O
still	O
was	O
very	O
greasy	O
and	O
the	O
bun	FOOD
	O
was	O
mush	O
by	O
the	O
end.	O
Am	O
willing	O
to	O
try	O
it	O
again	O
and	O
see	O
how	O
it	O
goes.	O
Will	O
update	O
review	O
thenI	O
went	O
here	O
with	O
my	O
girlfriend	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
ago.	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
black	O
&	O
blu	O
burger	FOOD
	O
and	O
she	O
got	O
the	O
guacamole	FOOD
	O
burger	FOOD
.	O
I	O
thought	O
my	O
burger	FOOD
	O
was	O
greasy,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
eating	O
it	O
the	O
bun	FOOD
	O
started	O
to	O
fall	O
apart...	O
the	O
service	O
was	O
ok,	O
I've	O
had	O
better	O
though.	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
OK	O
experience	O
but	O
I	O
won't	O
be	O
back.I	O
have	O
been	O
here	O
multiple	O
times	O

have	O
usually	O
had	O
great	O

but	O
last	O
night	O
was	O
awful.	O
	O
We	O
made	O
reservations	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
promotion	O
for	O
National	O
Cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
We	O
sat	O

10	O

eventually	O
flagged	O

us	O

It	O
worked	O
out	O
really	O
nicely	O
for	O

the	O
food	O
was	O
pretty	O
tasty.	O
I	O
don't	O

what	O

I	O
do	O
remember	O
enjoying	O
the	O
boxed	O
up	O
leftovers	FOOD
	O
The	O
service	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
considering	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
boisterous	O
group	FOOD
	O
of	O
about	O
20	O
ladies.	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
an	O
ice	FOOD
	O
tea	FOOD
	O
craving	O
that	O
day	O
and	O
think	O
I	O
went	O
through	O
about	O
8	O
glasses	FOOD
	O
of	O
the	O
stuff	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
there.	O
The	O
two	O

our	O

on.	O
They	O
even	O
allowed	O
us	O
to	O
bring	O
in	O
our	O
own	O
cake	FOOD
	O
Overall,	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
decent	O
basic	O
Italian	O
food,	O
but	O
really	O
good	O
at	O
handling	O
larger	O
parties	O
if	O
you	O
call	O
ahead.Expectations	O
weren't	O
high	O
as	O
I	O
realized	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
chain	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
definite	O
step	O
above	O
Olive	FOOD
	O
Garden	O

that.	O
	O
I	O
didn't	O
feel	O
like	O
going	O
out	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O

so	O
I	O
figured	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
go.	O
	O
Glad	O
I	O
did	O
because	O
they	O

one	O

the	O

	O
The	O

	O
Supreme	FOOD
	O
dish	O
was	O
good	O
as	O
well.	O
	O
I	O
would	O
definitely	O
try	O
if	O
I	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
area	O
and	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
if	O
I	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
hotel	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
feel	O
like	O
going	O
out.	O
	O
I	O
believe	O
they	O
do	O
the	O
room	O
service	O
for	O
this	O
Holiday	O
Inn	O
Suites	O
but	O
you	O
might	O
want	O
to	O
check	O
first.Had	O
to	O
wait	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
to	O
be	O
seated	O
this	O
past	O
time	O
I	O
went.	O
But	O
nothing	O
to	O
horrible.	O
Prices	O
are	O
a	O
little	O
high	O
but	O
the	O
staff	O
is	O
always	O
friendly	O
and	O
the	O
food	O
always	O
tastes	O
really	O
good.	O
Will	O
definitely	O
go	O
back	O
again.Benvenutos	O
is	O
exactly	O
what	O
you'd	O
expect	O
of	O
an	O
Americanized	O
"Italian"	O
restaurant.	O
They've	O
got	O
your	O
fresh	O
baked	O
bread	FOOD
	O
with	O
olive oil	FOOD
,	O
a	O
wide	O
variety	O
of	O
parmesan	FOOD
	O
filled	O
or	O
topped	O
pastas,	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
red	FOOD
	O
wine	FOOD
	O
that	O
doesn't	O
technically	O
go	O
with	O
your	O
meal	FOOD
,	O
and	O
some	O
ridiculously	O
cheesy	O
music	O
that	O
really	O
only	O
should	O
be	O
played	O
in	O
a	O
movie	O
when	O
someone	O
is	O
riding	O
a	O
gondola	O
in	O
Venice.	O
Sometimes	O
this	O
is	O
exactly	O
what	O
you	O
want,	O
a	O
definite	O
dad	O
pleaser	O
for	O
my	O
family.	O
Sometimes	O
you	O
want	O
something	O
that	O
actually	O
comes	O
from	O
Italy,	O
which	O
probably	O
couldn't	O
be	O
further	O
from	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
Tonight	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
six	O
ounce	O
sirloin	FOOD
	O
with	O
some	O
seasoned	O
veggies.	O
The	O
sirloin	FOOD
	O
was	O
medium	O
rare	O
as	O
requested,	O
but	O
pretty	O
charred	O
on	O
the	O
outside.	O
I	O
suppose	O
ill	O
stick	O
to	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
next	O
time,	O
it's	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
the	O
most	O
of.	O
I	O
also	O
tried	O
their	O
chili	FOOD
	O
which	O
was	O
good	O
but	O
had	O
no	O
kick	O
at	O
all.	O
Perhaps	O
they	O
meant	O
minestrone	FOOD
?	O
The	O
best	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
meal	FOOD
	O
was	O
the	O
fresh	O
bread	FOOD
.	O
I	O
mean	O
that	O
not	O
as	O
knock	O
to	O
the	O
meal	FOOD
	O
and	O
more	O
as	O
a	O
compliment	O
to	O
the	O
bread	FOOD
	O
The	O
service	O
was	O
about	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
from	O
a	O
restaurant	O
that	O
had	O
their	O
waiters	O
write	O
on	O
your	O
table	O
in	O
classy	O
crayon.	O
The	O
place	O
looks	O
nicer	O
than	O
a	O
Chilis,	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
start	O
the	O
meal	FOOD
	O
by	O
demonstrating	O
your	O
tablecloth	O
is	O
actually	O
a	O
roll	O
of	O
paper	O
it	O
sets	O
the	O
tone	O
for	O
a	O
pretty	O
laid	O
back	O
meal	FOOD
	O
My	O
cousins	O
and	O
I	O
ate	O
here	O
before	O
a	O
movie	O
with	O
their	O
friend.	O
They	O
like	O
it,	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
bread	FOOD
	O
that's	O
pretty	O
good,	O
but	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
isn't	O
really	O
the	O
same	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
disappointed	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
only	O
three	O
soup	FOOD
	O
For	O
an	O
appetizer	FOOD
,	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
a	O
pretty	O
decent	O
tasting	O
bread	FOOD
.	O
It's	O
soft	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
olive oil	FOOD
	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
it.	O
They	O
brought	O
us	O
two	O
baskets	FOOD
	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
order	O
soup	FOOD
,	O
but	O
all	O
they	O
had	O
was	O
Tomato	FOOD
	O
Basil	FOOD
	O
and	O
Minestrone	FOOD
.	O
Neither	O
of	O
those	O
sounded	O
really	O
appealing	O
so	O
I	O
ordered	O
Portabella	FOOD
	O
Penne	FOOD
.	O
She	O
asked	O
if	O
I	O
wanted	O
a	O
salad	FOOD
	O
or	O
soup	FOOD
	O
to	O
add,	O
and	O
I	O
asked	O
what	O
my	O
options	O
were.	O
It's	O
a	O
house	O
salad	FOOD
	O
or	O
a	O
Caesar salad	FOOD
,	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
upcharge,	O
which	O
she	O
didn't	O
tell	O
me.	O
I	O
thought	O
perhaps	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
Olive	FOOD
	O
Garden	O
and	O
it	O
came	O
with	O
the	O
meal	FOOD
	O
As	O
I	O
said	O
in	O
my	O
other	O
location,	O
definitely	O
order	O
the	O
dressing	O
on	O
the	O
side.	O
I	O
practiced	O
that	O
again	O
and	O
boy	O
was	O
I	O
happy	O
I	O
did	O
or	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
drowning.	O
	O
Overall,	O
it	O
wasn't	O
terrible,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
write	O
home	O
about.	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
go	O
there	O
again	O
if	O
I	O
didn't	O
have	O
to.In	O
fairness,	O
I'd	O
give	O
a	O
3.5	O
for	O
this	O
place.	O
It	O
wasn't	O
a	O
4	O
star	O
place	O
though,	O
hence	O
rounding	O
down.	O
I	O
read	O
reviews	O
before	O
going	O
and	O
had	O
an	O
idea	O
what	O
to	O
expect.	O
	O
My	O
husband	O
got	O
the	O
pizza	FOOD
	O
and	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
plus	O
the	O
sample	O

appetizer	FOOD
	O
The	O
pizza	FOOD
	O
was	O
the	O
star,	O
with	O
good	O
quality	O
ingredients	O
and	O
nice	O
thin	O
crust.	O
	O
The	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
was	O
disappointing	O
at	O
best.	O
	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
bruschetta	FOOD
	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
pasta	FOOD
	O
which	O
sounded	O
really	O
good	O
and	O
looked	O
pretty.	O
However,	O
there	O
was	O
just	O
about	O
nothing	O
on	O
the	O
plate	O
but	O
a	O
huge	O
pile	O
of	O
pasta	FOOD
.	O
	O
Not	O
well	O
seasoned,	O
no	O
where	O
near	O
enough	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
to	O
coat	FOOD
	O
even	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
pasta	FOOD
.	O
	O
Two	O
measly	O
pieces	O
of	O
grilled	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
The	O
sample	O
platter	O
was	O
ridiculously	O
huge.	O
	O
Seriously	O
enough	O
for	O
4+	O
people	O
to	O
get	O
full	FOOD
.	O
	O
I	O
was	O
unimpressed	O
with	O
everything	O
on	O
the	O
platter,	O
especially	O
the	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
bread	FOOD
.	O
	O
Not	O
good	O
seasoning,	O
tasted	O
like	O
fake	O

	O
with	O
too	O
much	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
left	O
me	O
feeling	O
greasy.	O
	O
And	O
I	O
LOVE	O

	O
With	O
leftovers	FOOD
,	O
we	O
had	O
food	O
for	O
3	O
days.	O
	O
The	O

was	O
hard	O
to	O
find	O
and	O
didn't	O
keep	O
our	O
water	O
full	FOOD

	O
The	O

an	O
olive oil	FOOD

.	O
	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
for	O
the	O

so	O
in	O
the	O

this	O

the	O

After	O
reading	O
some	O
of	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
everything.	O
The	O
woman	O
at	O
the	O

we	O
try	O
the	O
Mardi	O

and	O
the	O
popular	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
try	O

was	O
told	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
substitute	O
the	O
regular	O

the	O

for	O
dirty	O

	O
First,	O
I'd	O
like	O
to	O
clarify	FOOD
	O
that	O
the	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
is	O
NOT	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
other	O
reviews	O
may	O
make	O
it	O
out	O
to	O
be.	O
It's	O
a	O
standard	O
French roll	FOOD
	O
with	O
a	O
standard	O
amount	O
of	O

BUT	O
the	O
flavors	O
are	O
admittedly	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
I've	O
ever	O
had.	O
The	O
juxtaposition	O
of	O
creamy,	O
tangy	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
with	O
the	O
crunchy,	O
juicy	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
combined	O

What	O
a	O
cornucopia	O
(nods	O

beautifully	O
tasty	O
french	O
creole	FOOD
	O
goodness	O
all	O
nestled	O
magically	O
in	O
compartmentalized	O
order	O
without	O
any	O
compartments	O
in	O
the	O
take-out	O
box.	O
It	O
traveled	O
several	O
miles	O
successfully	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
as	O
well.	O
The	O
warnings	O
of	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
and	O
lady	O
at	O
the	O
counter	O
on	O
the	O
spiciness	O
of	O
the	O
dirty	O
rice	FOOD
	O
and	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
creole	FOOD
	O
were	O
accurate.	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
flavorful,	O
creeping	O
sort	O
of	O
spice	FOOD
	O
The	O
name	O
"take-out"	O
is	O
rather	O
misleading	O
because	O
there	O
is	O
ample	O
seating	O
inside	O
the	O
place	O
and	O
many	O
interesting	O
jazz	O
memorabilia	O
to	O
peruse	O
over	O
while	O
eating	O
so	O
eat-in	O
instead	O
of	O
taking-out	O
as	O
the	O
name	O
suggests.	O
	O
I'll	O
definitely	O
be	O
making	O
a	O
stop	O
here	O
again	O
whenever	O
I'm	O
in	O
the	O
Madison	O
area	O
for	O
some	O
good	O
ol'	O
N'Orleans	O
style	O
cookin'.I've	O
always	O
meant	O
to	O
order	O
from	O
	O
here,	O
but	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
New	O
Orleans	O
so	O
often	O
that	O
it's	O
never	O
been	O
pressing	O
issue.	O
Finally,	O
one	O
day	O
the	O
cravings	O
got	O
to	O
us,	O
so	O
we	O
tried	O
the	O
place	O
out.	O
	O
The	O
place	O
was	O
exceptionally	O
easy	O
to	O
order	O
from.	O
They	O
don't	O
play	O
1,000	O
questions	O
with	O
you,	O
which	O
is	O
nice.	O
The	O
menu	FOOD
	O
I	O
admit,	O
when	O
I	O
picked	O
up	O
our	O
order	O
and	O
got	O
it	O
home,	O
we	O
were	O
slightly	O
dismayed	O
at	O
the	O
quantity.	O
We	O
ordered	O
two	O
dishes	FOOD
	O
Then	O
we	O
tasted	O
it.	O
We	O
had	O
the	O
large	O
trio	O
(combination	O
of	O
a	O
few	O
things)	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
good	O
--	O
the	O
flavors	O
were	O
great,	O
the	O
stuff	O
was	O
actually	O
spicy,	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
I	O
could	O
love	O
jambalaya	FOOD
	O
(normally	O
not	O
a	O
fan).	O
	O
We	O
also	O
go	O
a	O
shrimp	FOOD
	O
While	O
the	O
quantity	O
was	O
less	O
than	O
we	O
expected,	O
the	O
quality	O
was	O
superior	O
to	O
what	O
we	O
get	O
at	O
our	O
little	O
dive	O
joints.	O
You	O
can	O
definitely	O
see	O
they	O
emphasize	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
and	O
texture,	O
rather	O
than	O
giving	O
you	O
a	O
week's	O
worth	O
of	O
food.	O
That	O
works	O
for	O
me	O
--	O
we	O
were	O

off	O
our	O

	O
and	O
very	O

The	O

up	O

the	O
next	O

I'm	O
in	O

I	O

Mexican	FOOD
	O
This	O

is	O
an	O
afront	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
Mexico	O
and	O
their	O
cuisine	FOOD
.By	O
all	O
common	O
sense	O
i	O
should	O
detest	O
this	O
place,	O
over-salted	O
food...	O
check,	O
stereotypical	O
music...	O
yup...	O
includes	O
ranch	O
in	O
food...	O
oh	O
yes.	O
(and	O
then	O
there	O
are	O
the	O
monstrous	O
portion	O
sizes)	O
I	O
keep	O
coming	O
back	O
because	O
they	O
have	O
1/2	O
priced	O
margaritas	FOOD
	O
on	O
Thursdays,	O
a	O
fairly	O
decent	O
happy hour	FOOD
,	O
fresh	O
tortillas	FOOD

fresh	O

and	O
decent	O
service.	O
	O
The	O
food	O
plays	O
to	O
the	O
lowest	O

denominator	O
so	O
my	O
friends	O
who	O
hate	O
all	O
things	O
not-American	O
food	O
can	O
find	O
something	O
they	O
enjoy.	O
If	O
you	O
want	O
authentic	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
go	O
to	O
S.	O
Park	O
Street	O
and	O
hit	O
up	O
El	O
Pastor.	O
(for	O
serious)	O

to	O
choose	O

the	O

the	O

(east	O

a	O

I	O
ever	O
get	O
here	O
are	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
fajitas	FOOD
	O
and	O
those	O
are	O
fairly	O
hard	O
to	O
screw	O
up.	O
	O
Anything	O
else	O
I've	O
tired	O
here	O
has	O
been	O
sub-par.	O
	O
Really,	O
the	O
best	O
thing	O
about	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
the	O
freshly-made	O
tortillas	FOOD
.First	O
of	O
all,	O
they	O
charged	O
us	O
to	O
split	O
an	O
entree.	O
	O
In	O
fact,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
splitting	O
-	O
I	O
guess	O
they	O
charge	O
to	O
have	O
access	O
to	O
an	O
extra	O
plate.	O
	O
The	O
mushrooms	FOOD
	O
in	O
our	O
enchilada	FOOD
	O
were	O
canned,	O
and	O
then	O
burned.	O
	O
The	O
ranchero	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
tasted	O
like	O
the	O
red	FOOD
	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
Spaghetti	FOOD
-O's.	O
	O
	O
The	O
chips	FOOD
	O
and	O
salsa	FOOD
	O
was	O
less	O
spectacular	O
than	O
the	O
stuff	O
I	O
buy	O
on	O
sale	O
at	O
the	O
grocery	O
store.	O
	O
The	O
part	O
I	O
depend	O
on	O
most	O
to	O
get	O
me	O
through	O
crappy	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
food	O
-	O
margaritas	FOOD
	O
-	O
also	O
disappointed.	O
	O
They	O
tasted	O
like	O
Kool-Aid	O
(but	O
without	O
adequate	O
water)	O
and	O
lacked	O
tequila	FOOD
.	O
	O
This	O
was	O
all	O
at	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
location,	O
and	O
I	O
hear	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
is	O
even	O
worse.	O
	O
No	O
vuelvo.Not	O
even	O
the	O
hungriest,	O
rabid	O
infested	O
pack	O
of	O
Chihuahuas	O
would	O
touch	O
this	O
food.	O
All	O
their	O
food	O
is	O
canned	O
process	O
nonsense.	O
It's	O
like	O
Mc	O
Donalds	O
on	O
Mescaline.	O
Now	O
the	O
freshly	O
made	O
tortillas	FOOD
	O
are	O
good,	O
but	O
that's	O
it.I'm	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
lie	O
to	O
you,	O
this	O
food	O
is	O
nowhere	O
near	O
Mexican	FOOD
,	O
but	O
the	O
enchilada	FOOD
	O
suiza	O
is	O
delicious	O
in	O
it's	O
own	O
right	O
(ignore	O
the	O
side	O
dishes	FOOD
,	O
blech!).	O
	O
The	O
margaritas	FOOD
	O
are	O
delicious,	O
and	O
if	O
you	O
go	O
on	O
half-price	O
Thursdays,	O
very	O
reasonable.	O
	O
They	O
have	O
a	O
good	O
price	O
on	O
their	O
lunch	FOOD
	O
menu	FOOD
.	O
	O
	O
I	O
wouldn't	O

it	O
necessarily	O
if	O

eh,	O
it's	O
tasty	O
once	O

the	O
best	O

the	O
rye bread	FOOD

were	O
great	O
too.	O
	O
	O
Of	O
course	O
the	O
freshly	O

	O
were	O

awesome.	O

off,	O

a	O
great	O
surpise	O
for	O

Being	O

a	O

two	O
in	O
my	O
day.	O
If	O

despite	O
the	O
many	O
poor	O

know	O
this:	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
food	O
is	O
great,	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
nowhere	O
near	O
that.Let	O
me	O
just	O
get	O
this	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way.	O
I	O
grew	O
up	O
in	O
Madison	O
and	O
for	O
years	O
this	O
was	O
my	O
favorite	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
place.	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
possible	O
place...anywhere.	O
Then	O
I	O
moved	O
to	O
Phoenix	O
and	O
had	O
real	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
review	O
this	O
place	O
because	O
it's	O
not	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
other	O

are	O
making	O
it	O
sound.	O
Their	O
salsa	FOOD
	O
and	O

	O
are	O
fresh	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
around.	O
They	O
serve	O
you	O
fresh	O
warm	O
tortillas	FOOD
	O
with	O
your	O

well	O
with	O
anything.	O
Some	O
of	O
the	O
pre	O

	O
quesadillas	FOOD
	O
are	O
fantastic.	O
My	O

here	O
is	O
the	O
Bean	FOOD
	O
Burrito	FOOD
	O
with	O
red	FOOD
	O

.	O
The	O
way	O
the	O
beans	FOOD
	O
and	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
Still,	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
this	O
food	O
is	O
simply	O
not	O
authentic,	O
and	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
few	O
are	O
on	O
the	O
heavy	O
side.	O
You	O
will	O
walk	O
away	O
feeling	O
full	FOOD
	O
The	O
simple	O

is	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
superb	O
mexican	FOOD
	O
food	O
here	O
in	O
Madison,	O
and	O
Pedro's	O
fits	O
right	O
in	O
to	O
this	O
muddy	O
amalgam	O
of	O
mediocrity.	O
Some	O
things	O
it	O
does	O
well	O
though,	O
and	O
the	O
cheap	O
drinks	O
on	O
a	O
Thursday	O
night	O
usually	O
make	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
atmosphere.Not	O
bad.	O
	O
They	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
Valentine's	O
Day	O

we	O

quickly.	O
	O
Our	O

was	O
friendly	O
(they	O
have	O
been	O

and	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
pretty	O

	O
All	O
in	O
all,	O
not	O

to	O
separate	O
Pedro's	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
restaurants	O
in	O
the	O
area,	O
and	O
it	O
certainly	O
isn't	O
the	O
best	O
out	O

decent	O

Unfortunately	O
on	O

we	O

want	O
a	O
very	O
big	O
tip.	O
	O

and	O
general	O
lack	O
of	O
even	O

99%	O

couldn't	O

	O
We	O
were	O

says	O

	O
They	O

about	O

	O
The	O

Disgusting!The	O
west	O

better.	O
After	O
they	O

I	O
started	O

to	O
this	O

The	O

was	O
a	O
miscommunication	O
between	O
the	O

which	O
ended	O
up	O
costing	O

$7.	O
It	O
wouldn't	O
have	O

that	O

of	O
a	O

if	O
the	O

at	O

then	O
started	O

we'd	O

A	O

that	O
I	O
remember	O
fondly	O
from	O
my	O
childhood.	O
We	O
used	O
to	O
eat	O
there	O
from	O
time-to-time	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
kid	FOOD
	O
Sadly,	O
the	O
place	O
hasn't	O
seemed	O
to	O
evolve	O
much	O
since	O
the	O
80's.	O
	O
We	O
went	O
for	O
an	O
early	O
dinner	FOOD
	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
the	O
hot	O
fresh	O
tortillas	FOOD
	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
serve.	O
	O
There	O
is	O
a	O
tortilla	FOOD
	O
maker	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
dining	O
room.	O
	O
Unfortunately,	O
the	O
machine	O
wasn't	O
running.	O
	O
I	O
can	O
understand	O
that	O
since	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
pretty	O
empty,	O
but	O
the	O
tortillas	FOOD
	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
burrito	FOOD
,	O
it	O
was	O
ok.	O
	O
Nothing	O
too	O
exciting.	O
	O
In	O
the	O
80's	O
and	O
90's	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
great,	O
but	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
I	O
still	O
love	O
their	O
chips	FOOD
	O
and	O
salsa	FOOD
,	O
though!	O
	O
However,	O
that	O
probably	O
isn't	O
enough	O
to	O
bring	O
me	O
back	O
again	O
anytime	O
soon.Badger	O
game	FOOD
	O
My	O
husband	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
watched	O
many	O

at	O
Pedro's.	O
Good	O

and	O
multiple	O

have	O
made	O
this	O
our	O
go	O
to	O
spot	FOOD
	O
for	O
years.	O
The	O
service	O
is	O
always	O
slow	O
and	O
the	O
food	O
is	O
just	O
decent	O
but	O
it's	O
a	O
good	O
spot	FOOD
	O
to	O
watch	O
a	O
game	FOOD
	O
Tonight	O
was	O
a	O
completely	O
different	O
story!	O
My	O
Guinness	O
tasted	O
just	O
like	O
water,	O
I	O
suspect	O
it	O
was	O
watered	O
down.	O
Our	O
service	O
was	O
super	O
slow.	O
We	O
were	O
there	O
for	O
over	O
30	O
minutes	O
before	O
we	O
received	O
chips	FOOD
	O
and	O
salsa	FOOD
.	O
The	O
chips	FOOD
	O
were	O
hot	O
but	O
they	O
needed	O
salt	FOOD
.	O
Their	O
salsa	FOOD
	O
tasted	O
like	O
ketchup	FOOD
.	O
Once	O
we	O
ordered,	O
again	O
our	O
food	O
took	O
forever.	O
My	O
cousin	O
asked	O
for	O
sour cream	FOOD
	O
and	O
waited	O
another	O
20	O
minutes	O
for	O
it.	O
My	O
food	O
was	O
ok.	O
The	O
tamale	FOOD
	O
was	O
actually	O
pretty	O
good.	O
It	O
needed	O
spice	FOOD
	O
The	O
kicker	O
was	O
when	O
the	O
manager,	O
Brett,	O
started	O
changing	O
the	O
channels	O
shortly	O
after	O
halftime!	O
We	O
asked	O
the	O
waitress	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on.	O
We	O
came	O
for	O
a	O
badger	O
game	FOOD
.	O
Our	O

	O
We	O
asked	O
about	O
the	O

.	O
He	O
refused	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O
game	FOOD
	O
back	O
on	O
stating	O
that	O
they	O
paid	O
$2000.00	O
for	O
the	O
UFC	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
going	O

I	O
looked	O
around	O

the	O

He	O
again	O
referenced	O
the	O

His	O
solution	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
us	O
move	O
tables	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
our	O
dinner	FOOD
	O
Worst	O
of	O
all	O
was	O
when	O

told	O
him	O
we	O

two	O
decades,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
converted	O
my	O
wife	O
into	O
a	O
Pedro's	O
fan.	O
I'd	O
had	O
past	O
or	O
present	O
Madison	O
residents	O
take	O
issue	O
with	O
my	O
insistence	O
that	O
Pedro's	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
casual	O
dinner	FOOD
	O
place,	O
but	O
I	O
took	O
that	O
as	O
part	O
and	O
parcel	O
of	O
Madison's	O
legendary	O
pretentiousness	O
toward	O
anything	O
that's	O
not	O
"edgy,"	O
such	O
as	O
old-school	O
Americanized	O
Mexican	FOOD
	O
Unfortunately,	O
it	O
turns	O
out	O
any	O
snobbery	O
against	O
Pedro's	O
may	O
be	O
justified.	O
My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
stopped	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
in	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
years	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
both	O
sorely	O
disappointed	O
with	O
our	O
experience.	O
The	O
burrito	FOOD
	O
is	O
smaller	O
than	O
it	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
--	O
I	O
suppose	O
that's	O
how	O
they've	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
hold	O
the	O
line	O
on	O
prices	O
so	O
the	O
size	O
reduction	O
is	O
probably	O
justified	O
--	O
but	O
my	O
wife's	O
fajitas	FOOD
	O
were	O
chewy,	O
and	O
both	O
dishes	FOOD
	O
lacked	O
that	O
"kick"	O
that	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
have.	O
Our	O
quesadilla	O

	O

	O

In	O

the	O

I've	O
been	O
out	O

my	O
recollection	O
of	O
the	O
size	O
of	O

isn't	O
so	O
good,	O
but	O
the	O
patty	FOOD
	O
on	O
this	O

	O
was	O

	O

me	O
preface	O
this	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
I'm	O
usually	O
a	O
Burger	FOOD
	O
King	FOOD
	O
However,	O
my	O
friend	O
was	O
in	O
town,	O
and	O
I	O
thought,	O
"why	O
the	O
heck	O
not?	O
live	O
a	O
little!"	O
so	O
I	O
brought	O
her	O
here.	O
	O
On	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
McDonald's,	O
also	O
known	O
as	O
"Mickey	O
D's"	O
in	O
other	O
areas,	O
I	O
begin	O
to	O
worry	O
that	O
maybe	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
called	O
to	O
reserve	O
a	O
table	O
in	O
advance.	O
	O
However,	O
upon	O
arriving,	O
we	O
were	O
pleasantly	O
surprised	O
to	O
find	O
no	O
line!!	O
	O
We	O
did	O
wait	O
a	O
minute	O
or	O
two	O
to	O
be	O
seated,	O
but	O
apparently,	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
seat	O
yourself	O
places.	O
	O
As	O
I	O
approached	O
the	O
front,	O
I	O
was	O
immediately	O
mesmerized	O
by	O
their	O
huge	O
selection	O
of	O
burgers.	O
Their	O
menu	FOOD
	O
ranged	O
from	O
McSingles	O
to	O
McDoubles	O
to	O
even	O
McTriples!!	O
They	O
also	O
had	O
a	O
dollar	O
menu	FOOD
	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
their	O
house	O
special,	O
The	O
Big	O
Mac,	O
and	O
their	O
seasonal	O
Chicken	FOOD
	O
When	O
I	O
opened	O
up	O
my	O
box	O
of	O
chicken	FOOD
As	O
the	O
freshness	O
evaporated	O
with	O
every	O
bite,	O
I	O
really	O
began	O
to	O
taste	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
kinds	O
of	O
meat	FOOD
	O
that	O
went	O
into	O
making	O
the	O
nuggets.	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
even	O
tasted	O
some	O
pork	FOOD
	O
Oh	O
my	O
God	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
dipping sauces	FOOD

These	O

	O
held	O
the	O

	O
As	O
I	O
eagerly	O
unwrapped	O
my	O
Big	O
Mac,	O
I	O
was	O
slightly	O
disappointed	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
it	O
wasn't	O
as	O
advertised	O
(the	O
picture	O
on	O
the	O
display	O
made	O
it	O
seem	O
a	O

bigger!!).	O
Oh	O
well.	O
	O
I	O
would	O
really	O
like	O
to	O
commend	O
the	O
chef	FOOD
	O
on	O
making	O
the	O
buns	O
just	O
how	O
I	O
like	O
them,	O
extremely	O
soggy.	O
I	O
was	O
even	O
more	O
impressed	O
that	O
the	O
soggy,	O
limp	O
buns	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
maintain	O
their	O
round	O
form.	O
This	O
is	O
some	O
pretty	O
advanced	O
cooking	FOOD
	O
Anyways,	O
as	O
I	O
bit	O
into	O
my	O
Big	O
Mac,	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
tasted	O
was	O
the	O
mayo	FOOD
.	O
Actually,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
tasted,	O

it	O

really	O
liked	O
the	O

and	O
a	O
few	O
months	O

we	O
went	O
for	O
the	O
Friday	O
fish	FOOD
	O
fry	FOOD
	O
and	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
delicious-	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
fish	FOOD
	O
fry	FOOD
	O
we've	O
had	O
in	O
Madison.	O
	O
However,	O
when	O
we	O
went	O
back	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
so	O
later,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
horrible	O
experience.	O
	O
We	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
nearly	O
45	O
minutes	O
for	O
our	O
food	O
and	O
then	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
it-	O
it	O
was	O
terrible.	O
	O
My	O
boyfriend	O
had	O
the	O
garlic	FOOD
	O
chili	FOOD
	O
fries	FOOD
	O
and	O
they	O
arrived	O
not	O
only	O
COLD,	O
but	O
DOUSED	O
in	O
disgusting	O
grease	FOOD
-	O
they	O
were	O
inedible.	O
	O
We	O
mentioned	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
waitress	O
and	O
she	O
offered	O
to	O
bring	O
a	O
new	O
order,	O
but	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
the	O
new	O
order	O
was	O
just	O
as	O
terrible	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
one.	O
	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
roast	O
beef	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
We	O
hoped	O
this	O
was	O
just	O
an	O
unusually	O
busy	O
night	O
and	O
not	O
the	O
norm,	O
and	O
because	O
the	O
fish	FOOD
	O
fry	FOOD
	O
is	O
so	O
good,	O
we	O
went	O
back	O
again	O
tonight,	O
hoping	O
for	O
a	O
better	O
experience.	O
	O
We	O
were	O
wrong!	O
	O
We	O
went	O
around	O
7	O
and	O
waited	O
15	O
min	FOOD
	O
or	O
so	O
for	O
a	O
table.	O
	O
Once	O
we	O
were	O
seated	O
we	O
placed	O
our	O
order	O
right	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
waiter,	O
since	O
we	O
already	O
knew	O
what	O
we	O
wanted.	O
	O
An	O
hour	O
later,	O
we	O
were	O
still	O
waiting	O
for	O
our	O
food.	O
	O
All	O
we	O
ordered	O
was	O
the	O
fish	FOOD
	O
and	O
waffle	FOOD
	O
fries	FOOD
-	O
so	O
nothing	O
complicated-	O
and	O
on	O
such	O
a	O
busy	O
night,	O
you'd	O
think	O
they'd	O
be	O
making	O
sure	O
to	O
keep	O
batches	O
of	O
fish	FOOD
	O
and	O
fries	FOOD
	O
going	O
steadily	O
into	O
the	O
fryer.	O
	O
When	O
we	O
finally	O
got	O
our	O
food,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
tasty	O
fish	FOOD
	O
we'd	O
remembered	O
from	O
before,	O
but	O
by	O
that	O
time,	O
we	O
were	O
so	O
tired	O
and	O
crabby	O
from	O
having	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
so	O
long,	O
it	O
wasn't	O
quite	O
so	O
enjoyable.	O
	O
After	O
our	O
meal	FOOD
,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
quite	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
waiter	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
check,	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
didn't	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
pick	O
it	O
up	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
15	O
minutes.	O
	O
We	O
would	O
still	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
Dexter's	O
just	O
for	O
drinks,	O
but	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
we'll	O
be	O
going	O
there	O

eat	O
the	O
food	O
anymore.	O
	O
Two	O
terrible	O
experiences	O
with	O
inexcusably	O
long	O

	O
Consequently,	O
more	O

I	O

there,	O
I	O
ended	O
up	O
having	O
issues	O
with	O
my	O

I	O
ended	O
up	O

out	O

I	O

I	O
asked	O
Jenelle,	O
the	O

if	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
my	O
food	O
warmed	O
up	O
cause	O
it	O

she	O

me	O
with	O
an	O
atrocious	O

told	O
me	O
nope	O
and	O
walked	O
off.	O

I	O
said,	O
alright,	O

it,	O
and	O
left	O
the	O
$30.00	O

food	O

walked	O
out	O
the	O

I	O
will	O
never	O
eat	O
there	O
again	O
because	O
I've	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
there	O
food	O
gets	O
cold	O

hard	O

there	O

the	O

so	O
it	O
isn't	O
the	O
worst	O

I've	O
never	O

my	O

I	O
are	O
trying	O

a	O

on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

	O
I	O
tell	O
our	O

about	O
it	O
and	O
the	O

is	O
then	O
informed.	O
	O
When	O
the	O
manager	O
walks	O
past	O
the	O
group	FOOD
	O
to	O
investigate,	O
they're	O
not	O
being	O
noisy	O
so	O
nothing	O
is	O
said.	O
	O
The	O
noise	O
then	O
picks	O
up	O
again	O
and	O
our	O

comes	O
by	O
to	O
drop	O
off	O
our	O

	O
We're	O
told	O
that	O
our	O
meal	FOOD
	O
is	O
comped	O
by	O
50%,	O
which	O
I'll	O
obviously	O
take,	O
but	O
that	O
nothing	O
was	O
being	O
done	O
about	O
the	O
noise	O
because	O
the	O
manager	O
didn't	O
hear	O
anything.	O
	O
So	O
my	O
complaint	O
was	O
without	O
merit	O
and	O
the	O
loud	O

	O
shouldn't	O
have	O

that	O

	O

much	O
a	O
a	O
nice	O

	O
other	O
places.	O
	O
I	O
usually	O
think	O
the	O
'good'	O
chinese	O
places	O
have	O
decent	O
hot	O
and	O
sour	O
soup	FOOD
,	O
this	O

straight	O
out	O

	O
I	O
dunno	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
expecting	O
too	O
much	O
but	O
this	O
certainly	O
did	O
not	O
deliver.Quality	O
is	O
consistent	O
and	O
prices	O
are	O
more	O

The	O

is	O
very	O
kind	O

It's	O
our	O
go	O
to	O
Chinese	O

I	O
wouldn't	O
say	O
it's	O
the	O
most	O
authentic,	O

then	O
again,	O
it's	O
delicious	O

cheap!Owners	O
Lon	O

there,	O
which	O
makes	O
it	O
consistent).	O
Ambiance	O

the	O

a	O

the	O

it	O

think	O
it's	O
an	O

	O
No	O

really	O
nice.	O
	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
well	O
priced	O
and	O
the	O
service	O
was	O
efficient.I	O
had	O
just	O
moved	O
from	O
Colorado,	O
back	O
here,	O
to	O
the	O
midwest.	O
So	O
of	O
course,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
meatloaf	FOOD
	O
I	O
told	O
the	O
server	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
better	O
than	O
my	O
mom's,	O
and	O
that's	O
no	O
hyperbole	O
--	O
it's	O
DAMN	O
good!	O
	O
I	O
will	O
most	O
certainly	O
be	O
coming	O
back.I've	O
been	O
in	O
Madison	O
for	O
10	O
days	O
or	O
so	O
and	O
I've	O
made	O
this	O
observation:	O
Madison	O
residents	O
are	O
spoiled	O
rotten!	O
ROTTEN!	O
There	O
is	O
nothing	O
like	O
Monty's	O
back	O
home	O
in	O
Boston.	O
I	O
dare	O
all	O
you	O
haters	O
visit	O
its	O
counterpart	O
in	O
Boston,	O
the	O
South	O
Street	O
Diner	FOOD
.	O
Have	O
a	O
meal	FOOD
	O
At	O
Monty's	O
today,	O
I	O
accidentally	O
dumped	O
sugar	FOOD
	O
all	O
over	O
my	O
french fries	FOOD
.	O
Even	O
though	O
I'm	O
clearly	O
a	O
stupid	O
klutz,	O
they	O
gave	O
me	O
new	O
fries	FOOD
	O
anyway.	O
My	O
chocolate	FOOD
	O
malt	FOOD
	O
was	O
perfect.	O
Once	O
I	O
slurped	O
it	O
all	O
up,	O
I	O
felt	O
a	O
little	O
sad...and	O
then	O
I	O
discovered	O
there	O
was	O
ANOTHER	O
malt	FOOD
	O
And	O
believe	O
it	O
or	O
not,	O
I'm	O
a	O
connoisseur	O
of	O
vegetarian	O
reubens.	O
I've	O
tried	O
them	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
country	O
in	O
CA,	O
RI,	O
MA,	O
CT,	O
NY	O
and	O
Monty's	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
I've	O
ever	O
had.The	O
food	O
can	O
be	O
good	O
here	O
(not	O
great	O
but	O
good)	O
but	O
the	O
biggest	O
problem	O
for	O
me	O
is	O
the	O
AWFUL	O
service.	O
	O
Somebody	O
teach	O
these	O
people	O
some	O
customer	O
service.	O
	O
I	O
swear	O
that	O
the	O
guy	O
who	O
waited	O
on	O
me	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
there	O
was	O
high.	O
	O
The	O
interminable	O
waiting	O
for	O
refills	O
on	O
drinks	O
and	O
the	O
check	O
drove	O
my	O
blood	FOOD
	O
I've	O
determined	O
that	O
the	O
secret	O
to	O
getting	O
good	O
service	O
from	O
anyone	O
here	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
hot	O
looking	O
college	O
girl...	O
	O
that	O
seemed	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
waiter's	O
attention	O
focused	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
next	O
to	O
mine...	O
	O
Maybe	O
she	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
positive	O
posters	O
here.We	O
dont	O
live	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
town	O
any	O
more	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
do	O
go	O
there	O
on	O
a	O
Sunday,	O
we	O
like	O
to	O
stop	O
there	O
for	O
lunch	FOOD
.	O
And	O
few	O
times	O
this	O
summer	O
even	O
with	O
gas	O
price,we	O
drove	O
there	O
for	O
lunch	FOOD
.	O
	O
You	O
cant	O
leave	O
there	O
without	O
trying	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
pies	O
or	O
cakes.	O
Usually,I	O
wont	O
have	O
room	O
after	O
the	O
regular	O
food	O
so	O
I	O
end	O
up	O
taking	O
home	O
the	O
pie	FOOD
.	O
Never	O
been	O
there	O
without	O
having	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
20	O
minute	O
or	O
so.	O
But	O
it's	O
all	O
worth	O
the	O
wait.	O
I	O
just	O
wish	O
they	O
make	O
the	O
place	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
bigger	O
or	O
do	O
soemthing	O
about	O
the	O

	O
I'm	O
a	O

I	O

	O
there	O
and	O
now	O
that's	O
all	O
I	O

the	O

	O
Breakfast	FOOD
	O
places	O
are	O
generally	O
my	O
favorite	O
types	O
of	O
places	O
to	O
dive	O
into	O
in	O
new	O
cities	O
simply	O
because	O
breakfast	FOOD
	O
is	O
my	O
favorite	O
meal	FOOD
	O
I'd	O
never	O
been	O
to	O
Madison	O
before	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
say	O
it's	O
a	O
lovely	O
city.	O
	O
Of	O
course	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
in	O
late	O
May	O
when	O
the	O
temperature	O
was	O
a	O
balmy	O
67	O
with	O
nice	O
breezes	O
throughout.	O
	O
Monty's	O
was	O
good,	O
very	O
good,	O
in	O
fact.	O
	O
So	O
good	O
that	O
we	O
went	O
there	O
2	O
days	O
in	O
a	O
row.	O
	O
We	O
were	O
traveling	O
with	O
some	O
vegetarians	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
find	O
tasty	O
eats	O
on	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
There	O
was	O
disappointment	O
in	O
their	O
version	O
of	O
eggs benedict	FOOD
	O
which	O
had	O
a	O
mornay	FOOD
-type	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
that	O
really	O
tasted	O
burnt.	O
	O
Like	O
burnt	O
crap,	O
actually.	O
	O
Maybe	O
I	O
just	O
don't	O
like	O
mornay sauce	FOOD
	O
Coffee	FOOD
	O
was	O
good,	O
we	O
tried	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
desserts	O
and	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
diner	FOOD
	O
atmosphere	O
from	O
our	O
cozy	O
booth.	O
	O
Well	O
done,	O
Madison,	O
well	O
done.I	O
love	O
the	O
vegetarian	O
Rueben	O
and	O
stuffed	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
potato	FOOD
	O
pie	FOOD
,	O
but	O
I	O
haven't	O
been	O
thrilled	O
with	O
my	O
breakfast	FOOD
	O
experiences	O
here.	O
	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
Scrambled	O
Something	O
or	O
Other	O
on	O
the	O
day	O
that	O
it	O
happened	O
to	O
have	O
asparagus	FOOD
	O
in	O
it.	O
	O
I	O
never	O
did	O
find	O
any	O
asparagus	FOOD
,	O
but	O
the	O
eggs	FOOD
	O
turned	O
a	O
horrendous	O
shade	O
of	O
gray.	O
	O
The	O
potatoes	FOOD
	O
were	O
hardly	O
cooked	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
through,	O
but	O
at	O
least	O
the	O
biscuit	FOOD
	O
was	O
good.	O
	O
I'm	O
convinced	O
the	O
Mornay sauce	FOOD
	O
is	O
sausage	FOOD
	O
gravy	FOOD
	O
-	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
France	O
and	O
never	O
had	O
Mornay sauce	FOOD
	O
like	O
the	O
stuff	O
at	O
Monty's!	O
	O
Still	O
-	O
I	O
give	O
the	O
place	O
props	O
for	O
having	O
so	O
many	O
vegetarian	O
options.	O
	O
It's	O
fun	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
have	O
more	O
to	O
choose	O
from	O
than	O
an	O
iceberg lettuce	FOOD
	O
salad	FOOD
	O
or	O
grilled	O
cheese	FOOD
.I	O
was	O
in	O
Madison	O
overnight	O
and	O
ate	O
at	O
Monty's	O
not	O
once	O
but	O
twice.	O
	O
The	O
vegetarian	O
food	O
was	O
that	O
good.	O
	O
Madison	O
does	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
much	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
vegetarian	O
restaurants.	O
	O
Monty's	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
list	O
when	O
I	O
did	O
my	O
research.	O
	O
But	O
the	O
vegetarian	O
menu	FOOD
	O
at	O
Monty's	O
is	O
pretty	O
hard	O
to	O
beat	FOOD
,	O
especially	O
for	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
caters	O
to	O
carnivores	O
as	O
well	O
(unusual).	O
	O
	O
About	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
is	O
vegetarian-friendly,	O
with	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
vegan	O
items	O
as	O
well.	O
	O
The	O
veggie	O
meatloaf	FOOD
	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
the	O
food	O
we	O
ate	O
(not	O
including	O
the	O
pie	FOOD
),	O
but	O
the	O
tempeh	FOOD
	O
in	O
the	O
veggie	O
BLT	FOOD
	O
was	O
nicely	O
prepared	O
too.	O
	O
We	O
didn't	O
try	O
breakfast	FOOD
	O
items,	O
but	O
tofu	FOOD
	O
scrambler	O
was	O
available	O
and	O
looked	O
great.	O
	O
The	O
food	O
was	O
delicious,	O
the	O
desserts	O
were	O
enormous	O
and	O
divine,	O
and	O
we	O
thought	O
the	O
service	O
was	O
fast	O
and	O
friendly.	O
	O
We	O
were	O
there	O
on	O
a	O
Sunday	O
evening	O
and	O
a	O
Monday	O
lunch	FOOD
,	O
and	O
neither	O
time	O
did	O
we	O
wait	O
for	O
a	O
table.	O
	O
I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
this	O
to	O
anyone	O
who's	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
restaurant	O
for	O
both	O
the	O
carnivores	O
and	O
the	O
herbivores,	O
while	O
satisfying	O
both	O
groups.	O
	O
That's	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O
do,	O
and	O
Monty's	O
did	O
it	O
well.This	O
is	O
my	O
absolute	O
favorite	O
restaurant	O
and	O
anytime	O
I	O
come	O
home	O

I've	O

big.	O
I'm	O
not	O
a	O

I	O
appreciate	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
several	O

available	O
for	O
those	O
who	O

Overall	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
a	O
fun	O

to	O
take	O

are	O
visiting	O

I	O

Seems	O

warned,	O
it	O

the	O

wacky.	O
However,	O
it's	O
worth	O

Monty's	O

is	O
better	O
than	O
hit-or-miss	O

not	O
quite	O
consistently	O
good.	O
	O
Most	O
of	O
the	O

I've	O
eaten	O
there,	O
especially	O
the	O
breakfast	FOOD
	O
foods,	O
have	O
been	O
delicious	O
(and	O
huge),	O
but	O
I've	O
had	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
very	O
sub-par	O
meals	O
(one	O
was	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
literally	O
could	O

	O
The	O
things	O
that	O

off	O

what's	O

what	O

	O
What	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
egg	FOOD
-based	O
breakfast	FOOD
-y	O
menu	FOOD
	O
items	O
are	O
almost	O
universally	O
good.	O
	O

And	O
the	O
breakfast	FOOD
	O

	O
is	O
especially	O
good,	O
even	O
without	O
chorizo	FOOD
	O
(which	O
is	O
how	O
I	O
usually	O
order	O
it).	O
	O
As	O
for	O
the	O
breakfast	FOOD
	O
side	O
items,	O
the	O
potatoes	FOOD
	O
are	O
just	O
okay;	O
the	O

	O
are	O
great.	O
	O
Most	O
importantly	O
of	O
all,	O
the	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
is	O
superb	O
(even	O

she	O

	O
Unfortunately,	O
I	O
tend	O
to	O
shy	O
away	O
from	O
the	O

	O
items	O
so	O
I	O
can't	O
really	O
speak	O
to	O
their	O

	O
The	O
pies,	O
though,	O
are	O
heaven.	O
	O
And	O
it's	O
certainly	O
worth	O
noting	O
that	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
The	O
atmosphere	O
is	O
pretty	O
awesome.	O
	O
Outdoor	O
seating	O
is	O

	O
Indoors,	O
the	O

with	O
the	O
wet	O
bottom	O

	O
The	O
upshot	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
you	O

you'll	O
enjoy	O

of	O

I'm	O

you	O

the	O

all	O
the	O

	O
There	O
are	O
a	O

that	O
held	O
me	O
back	O
from	O

a	O
5	O
star	O
review.	O
	O
First,	O
there	O
is	O
usually	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
wait.	O
	O
The	O
place	O
is	O
popular,	O
but	O
I	O
don't	O
feel	O
that	O
the	O
food	O
and	O
eastside	O
location	O
(I	O
live	O
far	O
westside)	O
always	O
justifies	O
the	O
overall	O
experience.	O
	O
Secondly,	O
the	O
service	O
is	O
hit	O
or	O
miss.	O
	O
I've	O
had	O
some	O
waitresses	O
who	O
were	O
prompt	O
and	O
polite,	O
making	O
me	O
feel	O
right	O
at	O
home,	O
and	O
others	O
who	O
were	O
sarcastically	O
rude	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
people	O
in	O
my	O
party	O
almost	O
had	O
to	O
say	O
something.	O
	O
Furthermore,	O
the	O
kitchen	FOOD
	O
doesn't	O
always	O
look	O
clean,	O
as	O
trays	O
of	O

	O
Setting	O
all	O
those	O
things	O
aside	O
though	O
(which	O
I	O
know	O
may	O
be	O
hard	O
for	O

the	O
blue plate	FOOD
	O
is	O
a	O
Madison	O
delight	O
that	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
missed.	O
	O
The	O
food	O
is	O
so	O
good	O
you'll	O
be	O
stuffed	O
in	O
a	O
recliner	O
when	O
you	O
get	O
home	O
pining	O
for	O
more.We	O
went	O
here	O
over	O
the	O
summer	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
dream	O
about	O
the	O
biscuit	FOOD
	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
the	O

	O
The	O
wait	O
for	O
brunch	FOOD
	O
The	O
menu	FOOD
,	O
as	O
others	O
have	O
mentioned,	O
is	O
very	O
very	O
vegetarian	O
friendly.	O
We	O
tried	O
the	O
pesto	FOOD
	O
+	O
mushroom	FOOD
	O
omelet,	O
which	O
was	O
original	O
and	O
delicious,	O
as	O
was	O
the	O

	O

	O
We	O
also	O
tried	O
a	O

This	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
first	O

we	O
stop	O
next	O
time	O
we	O
are	O
in	O
Madison.	O
	O
Our	O
server	O
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
everything	O
we	O
ordered	O
was	O
delicious.My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
here	O
twice	O
and	O
have	O
loved	O
it	O
each	O

	O
This	O
is	O
not	O
only	O
a	O
nice	O
place	O
to	O
go	O
if	O
you're	O
craving	O
something	O
vegetarian.	O
	O
They	O
have	O
great	O
sandwiches	FOOD
	O
and	O
bowls	O
that	O
are	O
enjoyable,	O
	O
The	O
pies	O
are	O
usually	O
fantastic!	O
	O
So	O
many	O
choices...I	O
don't	O
think	O
you	O
can	O
go	O
wrong.	O
	O
For	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
looks	O
like	O
your	O
classic	O
greasy	O
diner	FOOD
	O
The	O
wait	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
on	O
the	O
excessive	O
side,	O
so	O
don't	O
hold	O
off	O
until	O
you're	O
hungry.	O
	O
I	O
never	O
manage	O
to	O
save	O
room	O
for	O
dessert	FOOD
,	O
but	O
I	O
hear	O
the	O
pies	O
are	O
excellent.They	O
always	O
have	O
better	O
than	O

waitstaff.	O
They	O
have	O
plenty	O

options	O
for	O

	O
food	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
very	O
well.	O

of	O
the	O

	O
are	O
phenomenal	O
and	O
some	O
are	O
simply	O
okay.	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
makes	O
getting	O

more	O
disappointing	O
when	O

The	O

was	O
our	O

We	O
had	O
very	O
slow	O

We	O
were	O

I	O
ordered	O

	O
Our	O

failed	O
to	O

us	O
the	O
scrambler	O
special	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
asked	O

told	O

when	O

the	O

were	O

there.	O
It	O
was	O
very	O

	O

were	O
also	O
a	O
real	O
let	O
down.	O
I	O

	O
and	O
they	O
failed.	O
However,	O
the	O

	O
We	O
also	O
ordered	O

Two	O
of	O
our	O

Fat	O
Elvis	O

which	O

in	O
a	O

so	O
they	O
were	O
upset.	O
Their	O
other	O
waiter	O
must	O
have	O
made	O
that	O
mistake.	O
I	O
went	O
for	O
the	O
key lime pie	FOOD
	O
which	O
was	O
delicious.	O
The	O
Fat	O
Elvis	O
was	O
replaced	O
with	O
a	O
drumstick	FOOD
	O
(?)	O
which	O
I	O
guess	O
was	O
good,	O
but	O
I	O
don't	O
like	O
peanut butter	FOOD
	O
Another	O
thing	O
is	O
if	O
you	O
sit	O
outside,	O
they	O
will	O
give	O
you	O
plastic	O
silverware.	O
I	O
didn't	O
mind,	O
but	O
others	O
in	O
my	O
party	O
did.	O
Also,	O
they	O
only	O
take	O
Visa	O

	O
Overall,	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
good,	O
but	O
the	O
service	O
was	O
not.	O
Andrew	O

off	O
his	O
humor	O
("Elvis	O

we	O
found	O
it	O
rather	O
obnoxious	O
because	O
we	O
were	O
sick	O
of	O
waiting.	O
I'll	O
give	O
him	O
some	O
slack	O
because	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O

it	O

	O
I've	O
always	O
considered	O
their	O

to	O

My	O

The	O

always	O
very	O

service	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
slow,	O
but	O
it	O
generally	O
isn't	O
an	O
issue	O
because	O
the	O

is	O
pretty	O

	O
The	O

what	O

	O
There's	O
an	O

This	O

the	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
cheeseburger	FOOD
	O
from	O
here	O
a	O
few	O
nights	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O

which	O
to	O
Monty's	O
means	O
completely	O
raw	O
in	O
random	O
spots.	O
Aside	O
from	O
the	O
random	O
rawness,	O
the	O
burger	FOOD
	O
tasted	O
like	O
it	O
was	O
over	O
seasoned	O
with	O
pepper	FOOD
.	O
The	O
meat	FOOD
	O
was	O
of	O
absolute	O
shit	O
quality,	O
the	O
bottom	O
bun	FOOD
	O
was	O
soggy	O
(probably	O
from	O
undercooked	O
meat	FOOD
	O

and	O
I	O
did	O
get	O
it	O
to	O

for	O
the	O

now	O
that's	O
classy.	O
I	O
have	O
no	O

in	O
this	O

Every	O
experience	O
I've	O
had	O
up	O

point	O
makes	O
me	O
wonder	O
why	O
I	O
bothered	O
to	O
return	O
one	O
more	O
time.	O
Maybe	O
there's	O
something	O
wrong	O
with	O
my	O

to	O
be	O
honest,	O
I'm	O
pretty	O
certain	O
that	O
there's	O
not.	O

There	O

nothing	O

I	O

how	O
the	O

put	O

down.	O
	O
It	O

it	O

	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O

Nothing	O

anything	O
spectacular.	O
I	O
had	O
an	O

the	O

never	O
came	O

my	O

likely	O
	O
to	O
have	O
restaurants	O
that	O
cater	O
to	O
my	O
needs).	O
My	O
boyfriend	O
did	O
some	O
yelping,	O
and	O
shortly	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
Monty's.	O
There	O
is	O
a	O
private	O
lot	O
which	O
is	O
always	O
nice	O
when	O
you're	O
in	O
a	O
busy	O
city.	O
We	O
did	O
not	O
sit	O
outside	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
chilly	O
but	O
the	O
patio	O
looked	O
pleasant	O
and	O
relaxing	O
with	O
beautiful	O
flowers.	O
When	O
you	O
go	O
inside	O
the	O
ambience	O
is	O
a	O
funky	O
little	O
50's	O
diner	FOOD
	O
with	O
amazing	O
looking	O
pies.	O
Even	O
though	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
crowded,	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
table	O
fairly	O
quickly.	O
As	O
I	O
opened	O
up	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
,	O
I	O
almost	O
died	O
but	O
before	O
that	O
I	O
even	O
thought	O
of	O
moving	O
to	O
Madison	O
right	O
away!	O
There	O
are	O
so	O
many	O
vegetarian,	O
vegan,	O
gluten	FOOD
	O
free	O
options	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
,	O
which	O
is	O
so	O
rare	O
to	O
find	O
at	O
a	O
breakfast	FOOD
	O
diner	FOOD
.	O
We	O
both	O
ordered	O
the	O
sweet potato	FOOD
	O
hash	FOOD
	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
die	O
for!	O
Just	O
what	O
we	O
needed	O
that	O
day!	O
I	O
wish	O
there	O
was	O
another	O
one	O
in	O
Illinois.	O
My	O
only	O
suggestion	O
is	O
to	O
serve	O
the	O
fruit	FOOD
	O
on	O
a	O
separate	O
plate	O
instead	O
of	O
piling	O
it	O
all	O
on	O
one	O
big	O
plate,	O
that	O
makes	O
the	O
food	O
messy	O
and	O
crowded.I	O
have	O
a	O
love/not	O
love	O
relationship	O
with	O
Monty's.	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
love	O
them	O
for	O
b-fast	O
when	O
I	O
ate	O
omlets.	O
Now	O
that	O
I'm	O
vegan,	O
it's	O
kinda	O
hard	O
to	O
love	O
them.	O
Many	O
of	O
the	O
items	O
can't	O
be	O
changed,	O
so	O
if	O
you're	O
not	O
a	O
fan	O
of	O
onions	FOOD
	O
or	O
even	O
allergic	O
to	O
them,	O
they	O
can't	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
items	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
pre-made	O
in	O
batches.	O
They	O
are	O
my	O
last	O
ditch	FOOD
	O
place	O

	O
As	O
for	O
the	O
donuts,	O
they	O
are	O
above	O
average	O
but	O
not	O
amazing.	O
	O
The	O
owners	O
are	O
so	O
kind.	O
	O
I	O
like	O
going	O
here.good	O
food	O
and	O
very	O
cheap.Since	O
moving	O
to	O
the	O
east	O

I	O
have	O
started	O
to	O
go	O
here	O
almost	O
every	O
Saturday	O
morning	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
donuts	O
and	O
a	O
coffee	FOOD
	O
(Can	O
I	O
just	O
say	O
that	O
cabbies	O
are	O
amazing?	O

know	O
where	O
everything	O

moist,	O
iced	O
just	O
enough,	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
ton	O
of	O

I	O
really	O
think	O
that	O
their	O
plain	O
glazed	O
and	O
their	O
boston	O
cream	FOOD
	O
donuts	O
are	O
the	O
best.	O

have	O
this	O

of	O

to	O
them	O
that	O
is	O
amazing.	O
The	O
fritters	FOOD
	O
As	O
far	O
as	O
the	O

the	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
in	O

(right	O
up	O

	O
So,	O
to	O
sum	O
it	O
all	O
up:	O
good	O
gyros	FOOD
	O
The	O
place	O
is	O
a	O

the	O
only	O

that	O
youll	O

Gyros	FOOD
The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
can	O

the	O

the	O

just	O
imagining	O

alone	O
are	O
worth	O
a	O
trip.I	O
usually	O
go	O
here	O
because	O
they	O
have	O
some	O
Halal	O

	O
but	O
it's	O
definitely	O
not	O
my	O
"go	O

	O
I	O
find	O
that	O
I	O
have	O

in	O
the	O
mood	O
for	O
it	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
really	O

it.	O

However,	O
my	O

chicken	FOOD
	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
really	O
enjoy	O
their	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
give	O

one	O
they	O

pretty	O

had	O
better	O

But	O
for	O
the	O

the	O

The	O
red pepper	FOOD

	O
The	O

	O
The	O
only	O
negative	O

the	O
service.	O
I	O
dined	O
on	O
a	O
Tuesday	O

at	O
6:30ish.	O
It	O
took	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
for	O
my	O

Though	O
the	O

There	O
were	O

When	O

there	O
seemed	O
to	O

My	O

was	O
not	O
of	O

descent,	O
which	O
is	O
perfectly	O
fine,	O
but	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
speak	O

thus	O
my	O
questions	O
about	O
the	O

	O
All-in-all,	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
again	O

the	O

was	O

good.	O
I	O
would	O
have	O

awful	O

went	O

the	O

told	O
me	O
how	O

I	O

my	O
experience	O

since	O
I	O

difficult	O

be	O
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
level	FOOD
	O
of	O

	O
To	O

we	O
could	O
see	O
that	O
the	O

had	O
changed.	O
	O

took	O
a	O
long	O

even	O
though	O
there	O
were	O
only	O
5	O

the	O

	O
The	O
service	O
had	O
really	O
changed	O
for	O
the	O
worse.	O
	O
The	O

would	O
clear	O

	O

a	O

10	O

the	O

	O
What	O
really	O
put	O
us	O
over	O

was	O
when	O
they	O
refused	O
to	O

their	O

that	O
they	O
sold	O
to	O

towards	O
the	O

(not	O
including	O

	O
It	O
had	O
only	O

approximately	O
6	O

this	O

	O

Therefore,	O
they	O

us,	O
we	O

a	O
sudden	O
need	O
to	O
try	O
some	O
wine	FOOD
,	O
so	O
he	O
asked	O
Sparky	O
what	O
would	O
pair	O
well	O
with	O
the	O
lasagna	FOOD
.	O
	O
She	O
didn't	O
come	O
across	O
confident	O
as	O
she	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
list	O
of	O
wines	O
on	O
the	O
menu	FOOD
	O
that	O
mister	O
dining	O
companion	O
was	O
holding.	O
	O
She	O
finally	O
chose	O
one	O
and	O
said	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
go	O
well	O
with	O
the	O
"meaty"	O
dish.	O
	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
what	O
either	O
one	O
of	O
us	O
was	O
expecting	O
because	O
after	O
all	O
this	O
is	O
Olive	FOOD
	O
After	O
Sparky	O
left	O
our	O
table,	O
dining	O
companion	O
says	O
that	O
he	O
expects	O
the	O
chosen	O
wine	FOOD
	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
suck	O
because	O
Sparky	O
doesn't	O
look	O
like	O
she's	O
even	O
old	O
enough	O
to	O
drink,	O
let	O
alone	O
have	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
fine	O
wines.	O
	O
But	O
you	O
know,	O
none	O
of	O
this	O
really	O
matters	O
when	O
you	O
consider	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
compared	O
to	O
her	O
we	O
are	O
old	O
as	O
dirt,	O
and	O
still	O
don't	O

	O
It	O

had	O
his	O
red	FOOD
	O
wine	FOOD
	O
something	O
or	O
other,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
right	O
it	O
sucked.	O
	O
He	O
described	O
it	O
as	O
tasting	O
like,	O
"the	O
barrel	FOOD
	O
After	O
the	O
main	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
seasonal	O
pumpkin	FOOD
	O

	O
I	O
made	O
sure	O
to	O
look	O
in	O
a	O
direction	O
where	O
no	O
one	O
could	O
see	O
my	O

	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
pumpkin	FOOD
	O
lovin'	O

by	O

and	O
this	O

	O
So	O
this	O
chain	O
experience	O
wasn't	O
too	O
bad.	O
	O
The	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
sucked	O
was	O
no	O
refill	O
on	O
the	O
bread	FOOD
	O

	O
If	O
I'm	O
going	O

those	O

they	O

	O
	O
Finally,	O
Sparky	O
took	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
to	O
bring	O
by	O
the	O
check,	O
and	O
this	O

ever	O
go	O
to	O

the	O

out.	O
Both	O

	O
My	O
first	O

was	O
a	O
one-star	O

it	O
was	O
ridiculously	O
hot	O

humid	O
inside,	O
the	O
staff	O
lacked	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O
motivation	O
for	O
good	O
customer	O
service,	O
and	O
they	O
crammed	O
the	O
7-	O

the	O
front	O
of	O
the	O

	O
My	O
second	O

was	O
a	O
better	O

still	O
not	O
one	O
that	O
would	O
cause	O
me	O
to	O

there.	O
This	O
time	O
around	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
reasonable	O
temperature	O
in	O
the	O
bar	FOOD
,	O
but	O
that	O
may	O
only	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
50s	O
outside.	O
The	O

more	O

no	O

a	O

it	O

it	O
does	O

My	O

15	O

spent	O
a	O

Fortunately,	O
I	O
think	O
the	O

figured	O
out	O
that	O
two	O

the	O

The	O

The	O

	O

a	O

	O
I	O
mean,	O
at	O
dinnertime	O
on	O
Friday	O
night	O
there	O
were	O
families	O
eating	O
here	O
with	O
lots	O

	O
That's	O
kind	O
of	O
weird	O
to	O
me.	O
	O
First,	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
appropriate	O
to	O
take	O
young	O
kids	O
to	O
a	O

.	O
	O
Second,	O
I	O
don't	O
really	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
around	O

when	O
I	O
go	O
to	O
a	O

	O
We	O
had	O
burgers,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
good.	O
	O
The	O

	O
had	O
all	O
the	O
usual	O
pub	O

and	O
they	O
also	O
make	O
pizzas.	O
	O
Many	O
people	O
were	O
eating	O
them,	O
but	O
we	O
didn't	O
try	O
it,	O
so,	O
shrug.	O
	O
We	O
also	O
had	O

	O

	O
They	O
were,	O
well,	O
cheese	FOOD
	O

	O
One	O
weird	O
thing	O
was	O
that	O
you	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O

	O
Overall,	O
we	O
enjoyed	O
it	O
here,	O
but	O
we	O
probably	O
wouldn't	O
come	O
back	O
during	O
dinner	FOOD
	O
hour,	O
as	O
the	O

was	O
a	O
bit	O

for	O

will	O

the	O
statement	O
that	O
the	O
reason	O
I	O
loved	O
this	O

so	O
much	O
was	O
largely	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
the	O
copious	O
blue cheese	FOOD

.	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
sure	O
the	O
walnut	FOOD
	O
burger	FOOD
	O
itself	O
was	O
why	O
it	O
tasted	O
so	O
great.	O
The	O
chips	FOOD
	O
were	O
also	O
awesome.	O
They	O
arrived	O
piping	O
hot.	O
Some	O
were	O
crunchy	O
and	O
others	O
were	O
chewier.	O
It	O
was	O
clear	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
made	O
to	O
order.	O
The	O
Bleu Cheese	FOOD
	O
Dip	FOOD
	O
they	O
came	O
with	O
was	O
similar	O
to	O
what	O
came	O
on	O
my	O
burger	FOOD
	O
We	O
ate	O
as	O
the	O
band	O
played	O
and	O
just	O
reveled	O
in	O
how	O
fun	O
the	O
whole	O

was.	O
By	O
the	O
way,	O
the	O
band	O
was	O
great!	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
Rockabilly	O

If	O
you	O

I	O

a	O

	O
All	O
this	O
said,	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
few	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
The	O
Harmony	O
could	O
improve	O
upon.	O
First	O
off,	O
the	O
tables	O
in	O
the	O
main	O
dining	O
area	O
are	O
plastic.	O
They're	O
the	O
exact	O
same	O
tables	O
that	O
you	O
played	O
beer	FOOD
	O
pong	O
on	O
in	O
college.	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
The	O
Harmony	O
excels	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
its	O
dive	O
bar	FOOD
	O
atmosphere,	O
and	O
not	O
necessarily	O
because	O
of	O
it.	O
Therefore,	O
if	O
they	O
invested	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
money	O
to	O
spruce	O
up	O
the	O
interior,	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
would	O
see	O
a	O
return.	O
The	O
Atwood	O
area	O
is	O
still	O
rocking	O
that	O
hippie	O
vibe,	O
for	O
sure,	O
but	O
more	O
and	O
more,	O
I	O
am	O
noticing	O
newer	O
and	O
more	O
upscale	O
establishments.	O
To	O
me,	O
that	O
says	O
that	O
there's	O
probably	O
a	O
market	O
for	O
it	O
and	O
the	O
times,	O
they	O
are	O
a	O
changin'.	O
Also,	O
I	O
don't	O
mind	O
ordering	O

at	O
the	O

However,	O
I	O

	O
(Note,	O
I	O
went	O

I	O

various	O

No	O
1	O
B-B-Q.	O
	O
Clearly	O
the	O
ribs	O
have	O
been	O
highly	O
reviewed	O
so	O
I	O
actually	O
went	O
for	O
the	O
full	FOOD
	O
slab.	O
	O
Then	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
choice	FOOD
	O
between	O
the	O
chopped	O
pork	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
and	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
,	O
I	O
went	O
for	O
the	O
pork	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
from	O
my	O
fond	O
memories	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
in	O
Alabama.	O
	O
Ordering	O
over	O
the	O
phone,	O
everything	O
seemed	O
to	O
go	O
well.	O
	O
I	O
then	O
arrived	O
about	O
a	O
half	O
hour	O
later.	O
	O
There	O
was	O
1	O
person	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
me	O
who	O
paid	O
and	O
was	O
getting	O
ready	O
to	O
leave	O
when	O
they	O
brought	O
my	O
order	O
to	O
the	O
counter	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
clearly	O
wrong.	O
	O
They	O
had	O
given	O
my	O
order	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
before	O
me	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
his.	O
	O
Apparently	O
we	O
both	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
first	O
name.	O
	O
Now	O
this	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
perturbed	O
by	O
and	O
was	O
okay	O
with,	O
it	O
was	O
what	O
followed	O
that	O
made	O
me	O
give	O
this	O

1	O

	O
So	O
the	O

lady	O
tells	O
me	O
she'll	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
me	O
first	O
before	O
resolving	O
his	O
issue,	O
great!	O
	O
So	O
she	O
charges	O
my	O
card	O
for	O
64.66	O
which	O
was	O
clearly	O
way	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
should	O

and	O
she	O
couldn't	O
understand	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
talking	O
about,	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
over-explain	O
what	O
I	O
ordered	O

finally	O
got	O
through	O

her.	O
	O
She	O
took	O
the	O

some	O

would	O

	O
Now	O
I	O

	O
She	O
refunds	O
me	O
around	O
32	O

	O
in	O

to	O
make	O
up	O

	O
I	O
get	O
a	O
new	O
bag	O
of	O
food	O
and	O
am	O
finally	O
done	O
with	O
the	O
transaction,	O
took	O
about	O
15	O

	O
Fine,	O
I	O
was	O
happy	O
in	O
knowing	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
dinner	FOOD
	O
So	O
I	O
come	O
back	O
and	O
begin	O
with	O
the	O
ribs,	O
1/2	O
a	O
slab.	O
	O
From	O
the	O
first	O
taste	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
impressed.	O
	O
I've	O
had	O
better	O
ribs	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
country	O
from	O
Los	O
Angeles	O
to	O
Alabama	O
to	O
Texas	O
and	O
Chicago.	O
	O
Seriously?	O
	O
This	O
place	O
has	O
won	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
awards,	O
I	O
don't	O
get	O
it.	O
	O
Almost	O
every	O
other	O
place	O
I've	O
eaten	O
ribs	O
in	O
my	O
40+	O
years	O
of	O
life	O
has	O
been	O
better	O
than	O
this	O
place.	O
	O
The	O
sugar	FOOD
-fried"	O
biscuits	FOOD
	O
are	O
nothing	O
with	O
nothing,	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
better	O
donuts	O
nearly	O
anywhere,	O
seriously	O
(again).	O
	O
The	O
fries	FOOD
	O
dipped	O
in	O
the	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
were	O
the	O
best	O
part	O
by	O
far.	O
	O
The	O
corn	FOOD
	O
was	O
pretty	O
good	O
too,	O
but	O
still	O
a	O
little	O
over	O
the	O
top	O
on	O
the	O
taste,	O
hard	O
to	O
describe.	O
	O
So	O
after	O
being	O
disappointed,	O
I	O
checked	O
out	O
the	O
pork	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
,	O
and	O
oddly	O
enough	O
there	O
were	O
3	O
small	O
containers	FOOD
	O
with	O
the	O
sandwich	FOOD
,	O
and	O
somehow	O
it	O
didn't	O
look	O
like	O
pork	FOOD
	O
either.	O
	O
I	O
examined	O
further,	O
it	O
was	O
chicken	FOOD
,	O
yet	O
another	O
screw-up	O
with	O
my	O
order,	O
wow!	O
	O
And	O
I	O
ordered	O
fries	FOOD
	O
and	O
mashed potatoes	FOOD
,	O
neither	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
included.	O
	O
Instead	O
I	O
found	O
off-the-shelf	O
beans	FOOD
,	O
apple sauce	FOOD
	O
(why?)	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
homemade,	O
just	O
spooned	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
jar,	O
and	O
the	O
third	O
container	O
was	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
sauce	FOOD
,	O
which	O
I	O
didn't	O
need	O
since	O
I	O
bought	O
a	O
whole	O
bottle	FOOD
.	O
	O
So	O
the	O
other	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
order	O
was	O
completely	O
wrong	O
in	O
every	O
respect.	O
	O
And	O
note,	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
was	O
not	O
anything	O
to	O
write	O
home	O
about	O
either.	O
	O
I	O
drove	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
Madison,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
fairly	O
pleasant	O
1/2	O
hour	O
drive,	O
paid	O
around	O
33	O
bucks	FOOD
	O
I	O
strongly	O
recommend	O
NOT	O
going	O
to	O
this	O
place,	O
unless	O
you	O
like	O
to	O
take	O
risks,	O
maybe	O
you'll	O
like	O
what	O
you	O
find,	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
in	O
Madison,	O
I'll	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
elsewhere	O
in	O
the	O

to	O
find	O
good	O

	O
Oh	O
well...Great	O
BBQ	FOOD
It's	O
a	O
little	O
out	O

if	O
you're	O
looking	O
for	O

I	O
don't	O
remember	O

After	O

was	O
almost	O

good	O

The	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
was	O
so	O
tender	O
and	O
flavorful.	O
	O
Sides	O
were	O
good	O
but	O
not	O
as	O
amazing	O
as	O
the	O
meat	FOOD
.	O
Will	O
definitely	O
be	O
back	O
to	O
try	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
Pork	FOOD
	O
ribs	O
are	O
amazing.	O
I've	O
had	O
ribs	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
US	O
and	O
the	O
ones	O
here	O
compare	O
favorably	O
with	O
all	O
of	O
them.	O
The	O
meat	FOOD
	O
falls	O
off	O
of	O
the	O
bones	O
and	O
have	O
a	O
smoky	O

The	O

	O
The	O

	O

	O
and	O

	O

are	O

is	O
pretty	O
good	O
bbq	FOOD
I	O
haven't	O
been	O
everywhere	O
in	O
town,	O
but	O
honestly	O
I	O
think	O
Famous	O
Dave's	O
is	O
better.	O
	O
Basically	O
its	O
decent	O
food,	O
but	O
if	O
you've	O
had	O
real	O
bbq	FOOD
	O
somewhere	O
like	O
memphis,	O
kansas	O
city,	O
st.	O
louis,	O
or	O
anywhere	O
south	O
of	O
wisconsin,	O
	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
disappointed.Well	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
tough	O
one.	O
A	O
few	O
years	O
back,	O
I	O
stopped	O
going	O
to	O
SJ'sbecause	O
I	O
was	O
sick	O
of	O
getting	O
rubbery	O
non	O
tender	O
ribs.	O
In	O
the	O
90's,	O
you	O
could	O
always	O
count	O
on	O
getting	O
the	O
BEST	O
ribs	O
around,	O
EVERY	O
time.	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Jon	O
worked	O
there	O
then	O
made	O
the	O
difference.	O
Since	O
he	O
retired,	O
I	O
dont	O
know	O
what	O
happened	O
exactly?	O
However,	O
recently	O
I	O
stopped	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
shoulder	O
platter,	O
and	O
everything	O
was	O
great,	O
so	O
go	O
figure.	O
The	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
is	O
fantastic,	O
and	O
when	O
done	O
well,	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
something	O
special.Went	O
here	O
with	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
friends	O
after	O
work	O
one	O
night.	O
	O
We	O
'd	O
been	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
The	O
first	O
thing	O
that	O
struck	O
me	O
was	O
the	O
great	O
atmosphere	O
in	O
the	O
restaurant.	O
	O
It's	O
a	O
small	O
place,	O
maybe	O
15	O
tables	O
total,	O
and	O
there's	O
blues	O
music	O
playing	O
in	O
the	O
background.	O
	O
We	O
put	O
our	O
order	O
in	O
at	O
the	O
front	O
window	O
and	O
then	O
grabbed	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
tables.	O
	O
We	O
grabbed	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
tables	O
and	O
didn't	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
very	O
long	O
before	O
our	O
food	O
was	O
brought	O
out.	O
	O
Oh	O
was	O
the	O
food	O
good.	O
	O
I	O
ordered	O
a	O
1/3	O
slab	O
of	O
ribs	O
and	O
the	O
pulled pork	FOOD
	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
combo	O
platter.	O
	O
The	O
pork	FOOD
	O
was	O
piled	O
on	O
it's	O
bun	FOOD
	O
in	O
plentiful	O
quantities.	O
	O
It	O
was	O
pretty	O
good,	O
the	O
pork	FOOD
	O
had	O
good	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
and	O
my	O
only	O
complaint	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
wasn't	O
quite	O
as	O
tender	O
and	O
juicy	O
as	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
homemade	O
stuff	O
I've	O
had.	O
	O
The	O
ribs,	O
though,	O
were	O
amazing.	O
	O
The	O

I	O
saved	O

available	O
(which	O

a	O
seasonal	O
item).	O
	O
It	O
was	O

with	O

with	O

	O
I've	O
never	O

	O
I	O

	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O

and	O
a	O
brisket	FOOD
	O

with	O
the	O
spicy	O
corn	FOOD
	O

the	O

	O
The	O

Ribs	O
=	O
VERY	O
well	O
done.	O
	O
Tender,	O
pull-off-the	O

	O
and	O
delicious.	O
	O
The	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
is	O
where	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
refinement	O
too	O
(beyond	O
the	O
smoking	O
process	O
of	O
course,	O
which	O
is	O
an	O
art	O
in	O
itself).	O
	O
There	O
are	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
flavors	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
the	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
and	O
it's	O
not	O
overdone	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
application.	O
	O
I've	O
eaten	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
Brisket	FOOD
	O
Sandwich	FOOD
	O
=	O
Boring.	O
	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
ordering,	O
so	O
kudos	O
to	O
the	O
service	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
dead	O
on.	O
	O
It	O
was	O
less	O
of	O
a	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
and	O
more	O
of	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
on	O
a	O
plain	O
roll.	O
	O
That's	O
fine	O
of	O
course,	O
but	O
for	O
some	O
reason	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
sandwich	FOOD
	O
doesn't	O
describe	O
this	O
well.	O
	O
It	O
does	O
remind	O
me	O
of	O
the	O
bare	O
minimum	O
approach	O
you	O
find	O
in	O
many	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
joints	O
around,	O
but	O
I	O
don't	O
like	O
it	O
there	O
either.	O
	O
Anyway,	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
was	O
very	O
tasty	O
and	O
you	O
should	O
just	O
order	O
it	O
on	O
its	O
own.	O
	O
No	O
point	O
in	O
getting	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
bread	FOOD
	O
that	O
just	O
hides	O
the	O
taste	O
of	O
good	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
Spicy	O
Corn	FOOD
	O
=	O
Awesome.	O
	O
Truly	O
delicious	O
stuff,	O
and	O
I	O
plowed	O

it	O
in	O
30	O
seconds.	O
	O
Perfect	O

	O
Baked Beans	FOOD
	O
=	O
Awesome.	O
	O
I	O
asked	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
made	O
in	O
house,	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
and	O
my	O

was	O
rewarded	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
finest	O

	O
one	O

	O
Thick,	O

a	O
good	O
way)	O
and	O
chock	O
full	FOOD
	O
of	O

	O
The	O
only	O
downfalls	O
would	O
be	O
that	O
it's	O
somewhat	O
pricey	O
for	O
what	O
you	O
get,	O
but	O
food	O
is	O
going	O
up	O
everywhere.	O
	O
I	O
also	O
ordered	O
a	O

	O
The	O

was	O
top	O

	O
Everything	O

more	O
was	O
explained	O

	O
I	O
only	O
have	O
myself	O
to	O
blame	O
for	O
trying	O
that	O

sandwich	FOOD
	O
combo.	O
	O
Please	O
take	O
it	O
off	O
of	O
the	O

	O
The	O

is	O
nice	O

very	O
'southern'	O

of	O
the	O

the	O

is	O
outstanding.The	O

were	O
the	O
best	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O

The	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
is	O
probably	O
the	O
best	O
I	O
have	O
had.	O
And	O
everything	O
is	O
very	O
smokey	O
flavored,	O
which,	O
for	O
me,	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
thing.	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O

try	O
the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
(awesome)	O
and	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
For	O
the	O
sides,	O
I	O
got	O
corn	FOOD
	O

the	O
French fries	FOOD

This	O
was	O
surprising	O
for	O
me	O

the	O

the	O

	O
was	O
unbelievable.	O
I	O
pretty	O
much	O

is	O
corn	FOOD
	O
Finally,	O
I	O
liked	O
the	O
style	O
of	O
the	O

then	O
I	O

with	O
my	O
ol'	O

;)For	O
Madison,	O
this	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
The	O
food's	O
good,	O
the	O
staff	O
is	O
friendly,	O
and	O
(for	O
freshly-made	O
BBQ	FOOD
)	O
the	O
service	O
is	O
usually	O
quick.So...this	O
is	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
food	O
that	O
will	O
kill	O
you.	O
So	O
there's	O
that.	O
But	O
that	O
being	O
said,	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
I	O
can	O
think	O
of	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
food	O
with	O
absolutely	O
no	O

this	O

is	O
best	O
for	O

You	O
can	O
sit	O
and	O
eat	O
-	O
there	O
are	O
a	O

then	O
there	O
are	O
also	O
bullet	O
holes	O
in	O
the	O
windows.	O
Since	O
it's	O
Madison,	O
I'm	O
assuming	O
someone	O
put	O
them	O
there	O
for	O
show,	O
but	O
definitely	O
with	O
a	O
real	O
gun,	O
so	O
anyway	O
I'd	O
rather	O
eat	O
at	O
home.	O
	O
Also,	O
if	O
you've	O
been	O
doing	O
the	O
House	O

and	O
want	O
that	O

you	O

So,	O
check	O
it	O
out	O
Madison,	O
it's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
different	O
but	O
that	O
doesn't	O
mean	O
it	O

fabulous!Delicious	O

for	O
a	O
place	O

This	O

known	O
for	O
its	O
ribs,	O
and	O
it	O
deserves	O
the	O
praise	O
it	O
gets	O
for	O
them.	O
There	O
are	O
some	O
other	O
hits,	O
and	O
some	O
less	O

stellar	O
items	O
on	O
the	O

the	O
half	O

jumbo	O
1/2	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
dinner	FOOD
	O
to	O
share,	O

the	O
chicken	FOOD
	O
was	O
really	O
dry.	O
The	O
ribs	O
were	O
amazing.	O
We	O

ordered	O
some	O
beef	FOOD

you'll	O
be	O

you're	O

If	O

to	O
order	O
any	O

you'll	O
save	O
about	O
a	O
buck	FOOD

it's	O
worth	O
it	O
to	O
venture	O
out	O

try	O
them.	O
The	O
baked beans	FOOD
	O

iffy.	O
I	O
heard	O

about	O
them	O

and	O
more	O
mayo	FOOD

It's	O
a	O

The	O

for	O
something	O
rich	O
that	O

definitely	O

you	O
up	O
and	O
leave	O
you	O
feeling	O
guilty.	O
The	O
ribs	O
are	O
top	O
notch	O
and	O
the	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
is	O
just	O
right.	O
Meat	FOOD
	O
falls	O
right	O
off	O
the	O
bone	FOOD
	O
and	O
the	O

are	O
adequate.	O
Just	O
wish	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
spicy	O
variant	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
items.	O
The	O
interior	O
goes	O
great	O
with	O
the	O
food;	O
lots	O
of	O
vintage	O
Americana	O
items	O
and	O
newspaper	O
cutouts	O
of	O

The	O

always	O
willing	O
to	O
help	O
you	O
make	O
up	O
your	O

about	O

The	O
wait	O
isn't	O
very	O
long	O
for	O
an	O

that's	O
valuable.	O
A	O

I'll	O
be	O
back	O
in	O

so	O

quaint	O
little	O
place.	O
	O

if	O

it's	O
best	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
to	O
go.	O
	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
1/2	O

came	O
with	O
Garlic	FOOD
	O

a	O

	O
The	O

a	O

well.	O
	O
The	O
size	O
of	O
the	O
side	O

	O
was	O
great	O
and	O
it	O
even	O
had	O
different	O
lettuce	FOOD
	O
types	O
and	O
carrot	FOOD
	O
matchsticks.	O
	O
The	O
Garlic	FOOD
	O
Mashed	O
was	O
very	O
tasty	O
but	O
there	O
wasn't	O
a	O

perhaps	O
a	O
small	O
ice cream	FOOD
	O
scoop	O
(like,	O

	O
That's	O
great	O
for	O
portion	O

	O
The	O

vinegary	O
Barbeque	FOOD

	O
I	O

it	O
overwhelming	O

then	O
as	O
I	O
noshed	O
on,	O
it	O
was	O

good.	O
	O
My	O

it	O

fantastic!	O
	O
The	O
chicken	FOOD

was	O
moist	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
touch	O
of	O

the	O

was	O
quite	O
elegant	O
with	O
the	O
meat	FOOD

	O
The	O
creamy	O

	O
was	O
quite	O

why	O
the	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O

won	O
numerous	O

I'm	O

this	O

exceed	O

and	O
was	O

cold.	O
The	O
baked beans	FOOD
	O
maintained	O
a	O
firm	O

and	O
should	O
be	O
ordered	O
with	O
any	O

the	O

The	O

eat	O
some	O
authentic	O

	O
at	O
Smoky	O
Jon's!This	O
was	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
I've	O

here.	O
	O
The	O
first	O
time	O
was	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
ago	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
and	O
ribs.	O
	O
The	O
ribs	O
were	O
really	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
was	O
decent.	O
	O
It	O
was	O
the	O
flat	O
and	O
was	O
cut	FOOD
	O
thin,	O
probably	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
touch	O
dry.	O
	O
It	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
flavor	FOOD
	O
The	O
second	O
time	O
was	O
this	O
month	O
(July	O
2014)	O
and	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
platter	O
with	O
two	O
sides.	O
	O
The	O
baked beans	FOOD
	O
were	O
decent.	O
	O
Nothing	O
special,	O
but	O
tasted	O
fine.	O
	O
The	O
Mac-n	O
cheese	FOOD
	O
was	O
pretty	O
good.	O
	O
There	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
cheese sauce	FOOD
	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
macaroni	FOOD
.	O
	O
I	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
crunch	O
to	O
my	O
mac	O
and	O
cheese	FOOD
,	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
thick	O
and	O
creamy,	O
which	O
is	O
OK.	O
	O
The	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
was	O
great.	O
	O
It	O
wasn't	O
cut	FOOD
	O
paper	O
thin,	O
had	O
a	O
nice	O
smoke	O

and	O
was	O
easily	O
pulled	O
apart	O
with	O
fingers.	O
	O
In	O
other	O
words	O
it	O
was	O
tender	O
and	O
not	O
dry	O
at	O
all.	O
	O
Much	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
I	O
visited.	O
	O
My	O
only	O
complaint	O
would	O
be	O
they	O
put	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
on	O
the	O
brisket	FOOD
.	O
	O
I	O
prefer	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
because	O
good	O
barbeque	FOOD
	O
doesn't	O
need	O
sauce	FOOD
	O
and	O
this	O
brisket	FOOD
	O
didn't	O
need	O
sauce	FOOD
.Jon's	O
place	O
is	O
good	O
quality	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
and	O
I	O
can	O
see	O
why	O
it	O
gets	O
the	O
following,	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
agree	O
with	O
a	O
few	O
that	O
have	O
said	O
it's	O
not	O
the	O
best	O
they	O
have	O
had.	O
	O
I	O
how	O
ever	O
can	O
see	O
why	O
many	O
have	O
said	O
it's	O
great.	O
	O
Madison	O
lacks	O
good	O
BBQ	FOOD
	O
so	O
it	O
was	O

I	O

found	O
the	O

	O
a	O
little	O

I've	O
had	O
a	O

they	O

that	O

	O

is	O
all	O

because	O
the	O

50's	O

the	O

thing	O
that	O

still	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O

	O
I	O

a	O
frozen	O
custard	FOOD
	O
We	O
came	O
here	O
at	O
about	O
9:30	O
on	O
a	O
Thursday	O
night	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
dead.	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
were	O
expecting	O
a	O
normal	O
ice cream	FOOD
	O
shop	O
kind	O
of	O
atmosphere,	O
with	O
a	O
big	O
case	O
of	O
flavors	O
to	O
look	O
at,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
deer	FOOD
-in-headlights	O
moment	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
walked	O
in,	O
trying	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
supposed	O
to	O
order.	O
It	O
turns	O
out	O
they	O
only	O
have	O
3	O
flavors	O
vanilla	FOOD
,	O
chocolate	FOOD
,	O
and	O
one	O
other)	O
per	O
day,	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
your	O
choices	O
come	O
from	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
sundae	FOOD
	O
you	O
get.	O
Once	O
we	O
figured	O
that	O
out,	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
sundae	FOOD
	O
choices	O
seemed	O
pretty	O
solid.	O
I	O
ended	O
up	O
going	O
with	O
Turtle	FOOD
,	O
and	O
my	O
husband	O
got	O
the	O
Peanut Butter	FOOD
	O
Cup.	O
Both	O
were	O
excellent.	O
The	O
chocolate	FOOD
	O
shell	O
on	O
the	O
PBC	O
was	O
nicely	O
chocolaty,	O
especially	O
for	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
product,	O
and	O
I	O
appreciated	O
that	O
they	O
didn't	O
skimp	O
on	O
the	O
pecans	FOOD
	O
for	O
the	O
Turtle	FOOD
.	O
We	O
both	O
had	O
smalls,	O
which	O
were	O
QUITE	O
ample.	O
We	O
also	O
got	O
a	O
K9	O
custard	FOOD
	O
for	O
our	O
dog	FOOD
	O
I	O
guess	O
I	O
just	O
have	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
objections	O
that	O
keep	O
this	O
from	O
being	O
a	O
4-star	O
place.	O
First,	O
I	O
wish	O
they	O
had	O
more	O
flavors,	O
since	O
I	O
don't	O
always	O
want	O
a	O
sundae	FOOD
	O
(but	O
maybe	O
this	O
is	O
characteristic	O
of	O
frozen	O
custard	FOOD
	O
joints	O
and	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
fair	O
criticism).	O
Second,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
served	O
slightly	O
colder	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
doesn't	O
melt	FOOD
	O
as	O
fast	O
when	O
the	O
hot	O
fudge	FOOD
	O
hits	O
it.	O
Third,	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
overpriced	O
for	O
a	O
fast food	FOOD
-style	O
place.	O
This	O
is	O
especially	O
true	O
of	O
the	O
K9	O
custard	FOOD
,	O
since	O
we're	O
used	O
to	O
getting	O
something	O
more	O
along	O
the	O
lines	O
of	O
a	O
79-cent	O
kiddie	O
cone	O
for	O
the	O
dog	FOOD
.	O
We'll	O
probably	O
be	O
back,	O
since	O
its	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood,	O
but	O
this	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
last	O
frozen	O
dessert	FOOD
	O
purveyor	O
I	O
visit	O
in	O
Madison.Stick	O
with	O
Culvers!	O
	O
My	O
family	O
and	O
I	O
stopped	O
by	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
biking	O
around	O
the	O
lake.	O
What	O
a	O
rude	O
and	O
disappointing	O
experience.	O
First	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
staff	O
who	O
waited	O
on	O
us,	O
Andrea	O
was	O
short	O
tempered	O
and	O
not	O
into	O
customer	O
service.	O
We	O
tried	O
to	O
order	O
swirl,	O
but	O
they	O
don't	O
have	O
it,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
solution,	O
Andrea	O
just	O
said	O
no.	O
We	O
ordered	O
a	O
cone,	O
small	O
sundae	FOOD
	O
and	O
a	O
can	O
of	O
coke.	O
About	O
$10.00	O
later,	O
I	O
was	O
grudging	O
given	O
a	O
glass	FOOD
	O
filled	O
about	O
1/3	O
full	FOOD
	O
of	O
ice	FOOD
	O
for	O
my	O
not	O
very	O
chilled	O
coke.	O
The	O
custard	FOOD
	O
is	O
ok,	O
but	O
nothing	O
special.	O
Another	O
option	O
would	O
to	O
be	O
to	O
continue	O
on	O
the	O
bike	O
path.	O
In	O
Monona	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
ice cream	FOOD
	O
Maybe	O
it's	O
because	O
I	O
didn't	O
try	O
the	O
custard	FOOD
.	O
But	O
seriously,	O
I	O
didn't	O
need	O
more	O
weighing	O
down	O
in	O
this	O
weather...so	O
I	O
ordered	O
an	O
orange	FOOD
	O
crush	FOOD
	O
float	O
instead.	O
For	O
something	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
cost	O
me	O
MAYBE	O
50cents	O
to	O
make	O
at	O
home,	O
I	O
paid	O
close	O
to	O
$5	O
for	O
a	O
12oz	O
cup.	O
That	O
is	O
ridiculous.	O
In	O
general,	O
I	O
think	O
their	O
prices	O
are	O
pretty	O
steep	O
for	O
what	O
you	O
get....you'd	O
probably	O
have	O
to	O
order	O
a	O
burger	FOOD
	O
to	O
really	O
get	O
a	O
bang	FOOD
	O
for	O
your	O
buck	FOOD
	O
Like	O
RB,	O
I	O
also	O
had	O
an	O
issue	O
with	O
the	O
service.	O
It	O
was	O
slow,	O
disorganized,	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
friendly.	O
The	O
line	O
was	O
almost	O
out	O
the	O
door,	O
but	O
the	O
employees	O
behind	O
the	O
counter	O
didn't	O
even	O
ATTEMPT	O
to	O
speed	O
up	O
the	O
service.	O
One	O
of	O
them	O
just	O
disappeared	O
into	O
a	O
back	O
room.	O
tsktsk.	O
I	O
also	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
hilarious	O
how	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
employees	O
crumpled	O
up	O
an	O
order	O
form	O
before	O
the	O
order	O
had	O
been	O
completed,	O
and	O
then	O
had	O
to	O
UNcrumple	O
the	O
paper	O
so	O
she	O
could	O
re-read	O
the	O
order	O
to	O
her	O
coworker.	O
Really?	O
	O
Anyway,	O
I	O
will	O
probably	O
give	O
the	O
Monroe	O
St.	O
Michael's	O
-	O
and	O
their	O
custards/burgers	O
