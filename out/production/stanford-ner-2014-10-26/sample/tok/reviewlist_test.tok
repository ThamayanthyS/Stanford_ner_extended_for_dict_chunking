Pretty
good
dinner
with
a
nice
selection
of
food
.
Open
24
hours
and
provide
nice
service
.
I
usually
go
here
after
a
night
of
partying
.
My
favorite
dish
is
the
Fried
Chicken
Eggs
Benedict.Good
truck
stop
dining
at
the
right
price
.
We
love
coming
here
on
the
weekends
when
we
do
n't
feel
like
cooking.If
you
like
lot
lizards
,
you
'll
love
the
Pine
Cone!Enjoyable
experience
for
the
whole
family
.
The
wait
staff
was
courteous
and
friendly
;
the
food
was
reasonably
priced
and
a
good
value
.
A
word
of
advice
--
LEAVE
ROOM
FOR
DESSERT
!
the
deserters
are
great
but
huge
!
Plan
to
bring
some
homeOne
of
my
favorite
truck
stop
diners
with
solid
food
and
friendly
,
quick
service
.
My
god
,
those
desserts
are
huge
!
I
ca
n't
imagine
eating
that
giant
cream
puff
.
All
the
food
we
had
was
delicious
and
I
love
how
they
leave
a
carafe
of
coffee
on
the
table
.
Love
this
place
.
Would
definitely
be
back
if
I
was
in
the
area!Only
went
here
once
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
,
but
they
had
great
pancakes
!
My
only
problem
with
it
at
the
time
was
that
they
allowed
smoking
,
so
I
left
smelling
like
a
cigarette
.
With
the
change
in
law
,
I
'm
sure
the
atmosphere
has
improved!Great
truck
stop
restaurant
.
I
've
had
breakfast
and
dinner
here
and
it
has
always
been
good
.
Huge
portions
and
reasonable
prices
.
The
bakery
I
guess
is
legendary
.
They
have
doughnuts
the
size
of
your
head
!
Eclairs
the
size
of
your
arm
and
Cream
Puffs
that
are
about
10
''
high
.
On
our
most
recent
trip
in
the
area
,
stopped
at
the
gas
station
attached
to
the
restaurant
fo
some
quick
snacks
and
of
course
BAKERY
.
If
you
are
driving
by
and
see
the
sign
for
The
Pine
Cone
Restaurant
-
Take
the
next
off
ramp
and
stop
it.Yeah
,
thats
right
a
five
freakin
star
rating
.
Five
Star
Truck
Stop
Dining
At
Its
Finest
.
Be
prepared
to
eat
.
I
was
first
introduced
to
the
Pine
Cone
at
its
Johnson
Creek
location
years
ago
and
freaked
out
at
the
size
of
the
awesome
,
delicious
desserts
.
Then
on
a
recent
road
trip
someone
mentioned
about
eating
at
the
Pine
Cone
,
I
thought
is
there
really
more
than
one
?
I
looked
out
the
window
to
see
exactly
where
we
were
at
and
it
was
n't
near
Johnson
Creek
--
when
we
arrived
,
and
I
saw
the
bakery
...
I
knew
I
was
home
.
It
was
near
dinner
time
so
I
ordered
stuffed
chicken
breast
.
The
dinner
roll
alone
is
a
meal
.
I
ca
n't
say
enough
about
dinner
.
Everything
is
homemade
.
They
do
n't
add
alot
of
salt
,
if
any
.
You
can
tell
its
fresh
.
Its
plentiful
.
Its
cheap
.
You
literally
can
stuff
yourself
for
next
to
nothing
.
You
ca
n't
possibly
leave
this
place
without
indulging
on
some
bakery
goods
to
take
home
,
IF
they
can
make
it
home
.
In
our
case
,
they
were
safely
packed
in
the
trunk
for
our
safety
and
yours
.
The
last
thing
we
need
to
explain
to
the
police
is
we
were
under
the
influence
of
bakery
goods
from
the
Pine
Cone.Ate
a
Saturday
morning
breakfast
at
the
Pine
Cone
.
Friendly
,
quick
service
,
normal
prices
.
But
for
the
new
year
-
the
special
was
all-you-can-eat
pancakes
for
$
2.12
,
I
added
a
breakfast
sausage
patty
-LRB-
$
3.00
-RRB-
.
Father
had
the
typical
,
two
eggs
,
toast
,
hash-bowns
-LRB-
seem
fresh
cut
-RRB-
,
sausage
links
.
Food
was
tasty
,
no
major
qualms
other
than
-
the
hash-browns
need
a
bit
more
cooking
and
the
coffee
needs
a
bit
more
bite
.
very
nice
assortment
of
bakes
goods
-
massive
-
as
large
as
your
head
cream-puffs
,
eclairs
-
I
took
a
blueberry
muffin
to
go
-
which
I
enjoyed
.
Quick
exit
from
I-94
...
just
northeast
of
MadisonAttention
fans
of
David
Lynch
.
Do
stop
by
this
place
.
The
atmosphere
,
staff
and
patrons
will
certainly
help
to
make
your
visit
enjoyable
.
Last
time
I
was
here
I
ordered
the
caramel
nut
covered
cinnamon
roll
.
The
waitress
asked
if
I
wanted
it
warmed
with
some
butter
.
I
thought
that
sounded
even
better
and
said
to
go
ahead
and
do
that
.
She
nodded
agreement
.
Then
when
she
brought
it
to
me
it
was
unheated
and
no
butter
.
Odd
but
also
kind
of
humorous
.
I
always
enjoy
being
in
a
David
Lynch
film
from
time
to
time
.
The
service
and
food
is
way
better
than
the
country
restaurant
just
a
mile
south
on
51
.
Be
sure
to
go
here
instead
.
Their
booths
are
made
for
skinny
people
from
the
50s
.
take
a
table
.
start
a
conversations
with
the
truck
driver
to
your
left
.
We
used
to
go
to
the
Pine
Cone
when
it
was
across
the
street
.
Must
be
hard
times
for
these
guys
because
the
interior
appears
to
be
older
than
what
they
had
when
they
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
.
That
place
now
sits
empty
.
Why
is
this
area
depressed
?
Do
n't
ask
me
,
I
do
n't
know
.
Do
I
look
like
I
have
all
the
answers
?
The
food
here
is
good
and
the
prices
are
cheap
.
Go
here
for
a
nice
meal
and
a
flash
back
to
the
past
and
do
n't
forget
to
take
home
some
bakery
.
Or
if
you
are
n't
hungry
just
stop
by
for
some
great
baked
goods
.
Well
worth
the
stop
.
This
place
gets
four
stars
because
of
their
five
star
bakery
selection
.
Crazy
big
cinnamon
rolls
and
good
prices.i
rarely
give
five
star
reviews
but
for
what
this
restaurant
is
,
it
's
pretty
perfect
.
i
've
only
eaten
breakfast
here
-LRB-
twice
in
the
last
three
weeks
-RRB-
and
the
eggs
are
cooked
perfectly
,
the
sourdough
toast
is
made
in
the
kitchen
and
is
delicious
,
and
the
bacon
was
perfectly
crispy
.
the
hashbrowns
are
the
best
i
've
had
in
a
long
time
-
perfectly
crispy
on
the
outside
and
fluffy
inside
.
the
pancakes
are
huge
and
light
and
amazing
.
the
cinnamon
rolls
taste
just
as
good
as
they
look
.
prices
are
right
on
,
baked
goods
are
pretty
great
.
service
is
fast
and
friendly
-
really
fast
.
i
have
n't
had
to
wait
more
than
5
minutes
to
get
my
meal
.
i
might
be
in
the
honeymoon
phase
,
but
perfectly
cooked
poached
eggs
or
over
easy
eggs
are
hard
to
come
by
!
it
should
n't
be
an
anomaly
to
discover
well
cooked
food
,
but
i
suppose
it
is
.
sure
it
's
a
``
greasy
spoon
''
but
how
many
greasy
spoons
bake
their
own
bread
?
ca
n't
recommend
this
place
enough
for
great
breakfasts.With
a
recent
addition
of
a
truck
driver
for
a
BF
I
have
found
myself
frequenting
truck
stops
to
dine
.
This
little
place
is
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
.
Basically
it
is
just
great
home
cooking
.
Everything
is
homemade
and
quite
good
.
The
baked
goods
in
the
front
counter
were
amazing
.
The
size
of
the
cinnamon
rolls
was
insane
.
And
of
course
I
could
n't
leave
without
a
piece
of
pie.This
is
one
of
the
best
breakfasts
I
have
had
!
Is
the
decor
dated
?
Absolutely
but
it
just
adds
to
the
nostalgic
charm
!
The
place
just
reeks
of
beef
cooking
...
Ahhh
delicious
!
Check
out
the
pastry
cases
!!!!
OMG
,
is
all
I
have
to
say!hands
down
one
of
the
best
breakfasts
my
wife
and
i
have
had
.
stopped
in
here
based
on
the
positive
reviews
from
fellow
yelpers
and
was
sure
glad
i
did
.
this
is
a
good
sized
diner
at
a
truck
stop
.
the
first
thing
that
caught
our
eye
was
the
pastries
-
they
were
all
huge
and
all
looked
great
.
tip
-
be
sure
to
save
space
for
at
least
one
.
i
went
with
the
cinnamon
roll
french
toast
and
was
very
pleased
.
very
large
portion
and
great
taste
-
go
witht
the
sausage
patty
over
the
links
.
people
behind
us
had
links
on
their
plate
and
they
didnt
look
too
appetzing
.
the
patty
was
good
.

went
with
a
chicken
friend
steak
,
eggs
,
and
hashbrowns
.
hashbrowns
left
a
bit
to
desire
but
they
get
bonus
points
for
being
real
potatoes
and
fresh
.
overall
,
great
experience
and
we
were
in
and
out
in
35
mins
so
we
could
continue
out
journey
.
looking
forward
to
stopping
here
again
sometime
soon.This
is
definitely
not
your
usual
truck
stop
.
Pastries
look
delicious
.
Dinner
rolls
are
large
enough
for
a
meal
themselves
and
good
!
We
had
a
young
waitress
who
I
think
was
new
.
We
found
her
to
be
sweet
,
polite
and
trying
very
hard
.
The
lady
managing
the
restaurant
was
really
rude
to
her
.
We
could
all
hear
it.A
delicious
breakfast
.
Amazing
fresh
bakery
and
pastry
items
.
HOWEVER
,
the
parkinglot/gas
station
area
is
filthy
.
Strewn
with
debris
,
dead
cars
,
broken
glass
.
If
you
judge
a
book
by
this
cover
you
would
NEVER
venture
inside
.
I
hope
the
Mgr
.
sees
this
and
cleans
up.Don
'
t
be
fooled
because
it
's
in
a
truck
stop
,
truckers
know
where
there
are
good
places
to
eat
.
Stop
here
just
for
the
desserts
,
I
bought
an
eclair
that
must
have
weighed
a
pound
,
delicious
,
like
they
are
supposed
to
be
made
.
Cream
Puffs
look
like
they
would
n't
fit
in
a
one
pound
coffee
can
...
grin
.
Do
n't
miss
this
place
...
Continuing
on
my
Saturday
morning
hangover
theme
:
there
's
just
something
about
a
plateful
of
greasy
food
when
you
're
slightly
hung
over
that
makes
it
all
better
.
The
Pine
Cone
has
down-home
,
rib-sticking
,
greasy
food
in
spades
.
The
SO
and
I
split
the
chicken
fried
steak
,
which
comes
with
plenty
of
toast
,
hashbrowns
,
and
two
eggs
.
I
could
`
nt
finish
mine
!
The
gravy
must
be
the
same
that
they
use
for
biscuits
and
gravy
,
because
it
tasted
sausage-y
,
and
as
my
plate
sat
there
I
could
see
the
grease
rising
to
the
top
.
BUT
--
I
did
n't
come
here
in
search
of
health
food
,
and
it
was
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
.
I
'll
work
out
later.Some
times
Jane
and
Michael
Stern
are
on
point
and
other
times
the
story
of
the
place
beats
the
food
.
I
would
definitely
return
to
the
Pine
Cone
.
It
's
a
bakery
and
diner
attached
to
a
truck
stop
on
the
Wisconsin
highway
.
I
live
in
Chicago
and
work
in
a
famous
Mexican
restaurant
and
I
get
up
to
Wisconsin
for
the
old
school
steak
and
butter
as
much
as
possible
:
it
gives
me
the
energy
to
do
my
job
.
Pine
Cone
has
eclairs
and
cream
puffs
the
size
of
my
cat
.
And
I
got
a
pig
cookie
.
This
little
truck
stop
gives
me
the
big
energy
to
get
even
deeper
into
steak
and
butter
territory.I
like
this
location
better
than
the
one
near
Johnson
's
creek
.
It
is
a
bit
tight
when
you
walk
in
,
but
the
charm
soon
takes
over
.
I
was
not
really
impressed
by
the
food
.
However
,
their
pastries
won
my
over
.
Try
it
all
!
The
pie
was
delicious
.
I
went
with
a
simple
apple
selection
.
Delicious
,
perfection
.
It
is
nothing
crazy
,
no
fancy
name
but
truthfully
one
of
the
best
piece
of
classic
apple
you
can
find
around
here
.
The
service
is
a
little
slow
but
once
again
,
it
is
a
small
restaurant
with
lots
of
charm
.
You
get
what
you
get
and
I
love
it
.
It
is
near
a
Christmas
tree
farm
so
it
is
the
perfect
place
to
stop
and
get
some
cocoa
on
your
way.This
place
was
excellent
.
We
were
a
little
nervous
because
it
is
in
a
truck
stop
but
the
food
was
absolutely
delicious
and
the
service
was
fast
and
friendly.OMG
!
The
bakery
items
at
Pinecone
are
AMAZING
!
Cinnamon
rolls
as
big
as
your
head
and
absolutely
scrumptious
!
The
food
in
the
restaurant
is
great
for
truck
stop
food
.
We
've
only
come
for
breakfast
but
stop
every
single
time
we
head
up
to
Rhinelander
,
WI
.
Do
NOT
miss
this
place
if
even
only
for
their
baked
goods!A
really
lovely
surprise
on
a
rather
horrific
family
road
trip
.
We
were
greeted
at
the
door
,
the
waitress
was
a
peach
,
and
the
nice
man
who
filled
water/helped
out
was
the
sweetest
guy
ever
.
The
food
is
also
great
if
you
're
a
fan
of
the
diner-type
grub
;
my
hot
turkey
sandwich
will
live
on
in
my
dreams
.
You
can
definitely
tell
the
place
has
the
old
time
appeal
of
a
great
family
place
as
all
the
locals
-LRB-
mostly
older
people
-RRB-
know
each
other
and
it
's
clear
it
's
the
happening
place
for
breakfast
with
the
over-60
crowd
-LRB-
but
hey
,
that
says
the
food
has
to
be
pretty
homestyle
and
tasty
to
me
.
-RRB-
If
you
're
headed
down
94
and
need
a
good
lunch
stop
,
make
this
it.Very
nice
and
clean
place
to
have
breakfast
or
lunchI
eat
here
regularily
because
it
is
consistently
good
.
Very
large
menu
which
makes
it
tough
to
choose
but
never
disappointed!Unlimited
hot
coffee
.
I
do
n't
have
any
recollection
of
what
I
ate
...
I
wanted
t
give
it
four
stars
,
but
that
would
be
a
very
generous
review
for
a
meal
I
can
not
recall
.
I
know
it
was
decently
good
,
and
it
's
like
the
only
restaurant
in
Deforest
.
For
that
,
I
give
it
four
stars.Homestyle
cooking
at
its
best
,
dnt
go
to
culvers
,
McDonald
's
or
whatever
trash
is
right
off
the
hwy
,
head
a
bit
further
down
u
will
find
this
gem
,
one
of
the
reasons
I
love
this
place
so
much
?
They
dnt
play
annoying
music
,
scratch
that
,
they
do
n't
play
ANY
music
.
People
working
here
are
super
nice
as
to
be
expected
.
If
I
owned
this
joint
,
I
would
invest
in
a
new
bigger
sign
,
as
I
drove
right
by
this
place
and
almost
missed
it
twice.Nice
simple
homey
diner
.
Very
friendly
staff
,
huge
family
friendly
menu
,
salad
bar
.
If
you
are
on
the
road
this
beats
the
same
old
options.Love
their
breakfast
menu
&
they
have
friendly
waitstaff
.
We
go
there
nearly
every
Friday
for
the
last
4
yrs
.
I
love
that
they
do
n't
play
any
music
.
It
is
quiet
,
conversational
,
and
comfortable.Went
here
for
lunch
with
two
co-workers
,
checked
Yelp
before
we
went
and
the
reviews
were
very
positive
so
we
decided
to
give
it
a
try
.
Yikes
!
How
can
the
reviews
be
4-5
stars
and
the
service
at
best
``
average
''
,
the
food
was
terrible
and
myself
and
my
co-workers
all
agreed
,
this
restaurant
does
n't
rate
two
stars
.
I
had
one
of
the
special
Friday
offerings
,
Smelt
.
It
came
with
a
salad
-LRB-
very
average
but
fresh
-RRB-
,
fries
-LRB-
ordinary
-RRB-
and
the
Smelt
.
After
a
20-25
minute
wait
our
server
came
with
our
orders
.
I
looked
at
my
plate
and
was
shocked
!
There
was
12-15
so-called
Smelt
about
3
''
long
and
deep
fried
.
They
looked
like
little
fat
cigarettes
!
I
bit
into
one
and
it
was
all
batter
,
I
tried
another
and
it
was
the
same
.
I
had
deep
fried
batter
for
lunch
!!
I
have
n't
had
a
meal
this
bad
since
I
got
out
of
the
Navy
!
My
co-workes
meals
were
not
much
better
,
one
had
Chicken
Fried
Steak
and
he
said
it
was
made
out
of
the
box
.
My
other
co-worker
had
the
Cod
and
he
said
it
was
mushy
and
brown
colored
!
YUK
!
I
hate
to
write
such
a
negative
review
but
this
restaurant
earned
``
one
''
star
.
Maybe
they
have
great
breakfast
!
I
hope
they
do
because
their
lunches
are
sub-par
.
There
are
other
restaurants
on
this
street/highway
,
I
'd
give
them
a
try
before
I
stopped
here
.
I
know
my
co-workers
and
I
wo
n't
be
coming
back.Don
'
t
have
time
and/or
cute
outfits
for
Madison
but
want
an
alternative
to
Cracker
Barrel
?
This
is
your
stop
.
I
started
with
the
chicken
dumpling
soup
.
Simply
divine
,
so
much
as
to
seriously
tempt
my
veg
accomplice
.
Cheese
curds
were
another
hit
,
far
superior
to
those
from
the
state
fair
.
Wraps
,
sammys
,
even
the
fried
mushrooms
were
consistent
,
wholesome
,
and
fresh
.
Service
was
on
point
,
our
waitress
Brianna
was
business
pro
.
People
watching
was
a
little
poor
-LRB-
s
-RRB-
,
to
be
expected
in
rural
Midwest
?
I
think
our
impassioned
debate
over
drug
use
might
have
startled
the
crowd
.
Nonetheless
,
not
a
Cracker
Barrel
.
Takes
Amex.Huge
menu
,
fresh
tasty
food
,
reasonable
prices
.
Beats
a
chain
highway
place
for
sure
.
The
chicken
dumpling
soup
alone
is
worth
a
trip
-LRB-
fresh
made
every
day
and
it
caused
my
vegetable-phobic
daughter
to
eat
carrots
and
celery
of
her
own
voltion
!
-RRB-
;
the
steak-cut
French
fries
were
great
and
the
coconut
cream
pie
was
wonderful.Food
was
very
good
.
I
had
the
Reuben
sandwich
.
My
only
suggestion
is
that
the
waitress
should
check
back
more
often
to
see
if
we
need
anything
.
Otherwise
,
I
recommend
it.My
boyfriend
and
I
came
here
to
have
breakfast
after
New
Years
.
We
were
n't
expecting
much
being
not
at
our
best
either
.
The
service
,
as
mentioned
several
times
in
yelp
,
is
really
slow
.
My
drink
was
forgotten
about
and
the
next
time
our
waitress
came
around
she
was
serving
our
meal
about
30-40
minutes
from
taking
our
order
.
The
restaurant
was
probably
half
full
of
people
.
My
boyfriends
meal
was
mediocre
``
at
best
''
as
he
put
it
but
my
meal
was
worse
.
My
bacon
and
egg
omelette
was
burnt
and
the
cheese
was
scarce
.
At
the
end
of
our
meal
,
our
server
still
charged
us
for
the
missing
drink
but
they
were
kind
enough
to
take
it
off
the
bill
,
that
is
while
we
waited
10
minutes
standing
at
the
register
.
I
would
n't
go
back
to
this
restaurant
because
I
think
my
time
is
worth
more
than
they
treated
it
but
could
be
nice
for
those
who
think
differently.Nice
clean
place
with
a
very
friendly
staff
.
Great
homemade
chicken
dumpling
soup
and
a
very
tasty
club
sandwich
.
Decor
is
outdated
,
but
not
sloppy
.
Good
local
place
to
bring
the
family.Californians
are
all
about
the
In-N-Out
,
where
you
can
get
your
burger
animal
style
.
And
the
Midwest
is
all
about
Culver
's
,
where
the
Butter
Burger
is
the
thing
to
order
.
C.
and
I
ate
lunch
here
on
our
way
between
Milwaukee
and
Mosinee
before
going
to
my
folks
for
Christmas
.
I
got
a
cheddar
burger
with
fries
,
and
C.
got
the
two-piece
chicken
dinner
with
mashed
potatoes
and
green
beans
.
That
's
one
of
the
things
I
love
about
Culver
's
.
Yes
,
it
's
a
fast
food
restaurant
.
But
they
also
do
family
restaurant
food
well
.
The
chicken
was
good
and
the
green
beans
really
fresh
,
C.
said
.
Fast
food
you
can
feel
good
about
.
I
also
got
a
frozen
custard
,
their
flavor
of
the
day
:
Swiss
almond
Christmas
or
something
like
that
.
Chocolate
custard
with
slivered
almonds
.
Yummo.I
wanted
ice
cream
so
my
husband
pulled
off
the
highway
at
this
Culver
's
.
We
opted
to
get
the
flavor
of
the
day
-LRB-
cookie
dough
craving
-RRB-
.
I
was
disappointed
to
find
that
it
was
a
chocolate
custard
with
TONS
of
cookie
dough
chunks
because
I
like
custard
and
not
just
the
mix-ins
,
etc.
but
it
was
overall
a
decent
sundae
.
I
'll
just
stick
to
vanilla
next
time!Next
to
Chick-Fil-A
,
Culver
's
is
my
fav
fast
food
chain
.
Rarely
is
a
snowboarding
trip
complete
without
Culver
's
to
top
off
the
day
.
The
butter
burgers
hit
the
spot
-LRB-
though
mine
was
heavy
on
the
red
onions
;
good
thing
those
are
easily
removeable
-RRB-
,
and
the
fried
cheese
curds
are
to
die
for
.
You
do
n't
find
those
floating
around
just
anywhere
.
But
if
there
is
anything
you
MUST
get
,
it
's
a
cup
of
the
frozen
custard
.
Damn
,
that
's
good
stuff.Go-to
meal
:
cheddar
butter
burger
,
fried
cheese
curds
,
and
flavor
of
the
day
custard
.
The
difference
between
a
deluxe
burger
and
cheddar
butter
burger
is
that
in
the
deluxe
,
you
'll
get
American
cheese
.
And
you
have
to
pay
25
cents
extra
to
add
lettuce
,
tomato
,
etc.
to
the
cheddar
butter
burger
.
File
that
away
in
your
memory
bank.Really
good
stuff
!!
The
custard
was
great
!
I
loved
it
and
when
I
am
back
in
the
old
USA
I
can
only
hope
I
will
cross
paths
with
another
culvers
.
You
know
what
the
thing
is
with
culvers
?
You
actually
do
n't
need
that
much
,
it
's
sort
of
like
eating
cake
batter
or
cookie
dough
.
You
can
only
have
so
much
before
you
start
getting
that
sickly
feeling
and
start
stirring
that
plastic
spoon
around
and
staring
down
the
custard
and
wondering
why
you
dont
wan
na
finish
.
Yeah
it
's
custard
and
it
's
heavy
especially
when
you
add
every
kind
of
peanut
butter
chocholate
bar
to
the
mix.Let
me
tell
you
those
first
five
spoonfuls
are
pure
goodness
then
it
goes
downhill
.
Less
is
more
with
this
stuff
let
me
tell
you
!
Next
time
I
am
getting
the
smallest
size
,
and
I
will
be
far
more
pleased
and
not
guilty
I
threw
out
a
mega
size
bucket
.
Hahaha!My
meaty
goodness
...
why
is
n't
Culvers
a
nationwide
chain
?
This
bacon
cheese
burger
is
way
too
good
to
come
out
of
a
fastfood
drive
through
window
.
I
had
a
nice
little
picnic
on
the
tailgate
of
my
pickup
-LRB-
driving
cross
country
...
long
story
-RRB-
.
I
could
not
believe
how
great
this
burger
was
.
The
amazing
part
is
the
onion
rings
might
be
better
than
the
burger
.
If
you
're
passing
through
Wisconsin
,
you
need
to
stop
at
Culvers.Love
it
!!!!!
Love
it
!!!!!!
love
it
!!!!!!!
Who
does
n't
love
Culver
's
!
Everything
was
great
except
for
the
burgers
they
are
greasy
and
very
charred
compared
to
other
stores.I
really
like
both
Chinese
restaurants
in
town
.
This
one
has
outstanding
crab
rangoon
.
Love
the
chicken
with
snow
peas
and
mushrooms
and
General
Tso
Chicken
.
Food
is
always
ready
in
10
minutes
which
is
accurate
.
Good
place
and
they
give
you
free
pop.Above
average
takeout
with
friendly
staff
.
The
sauce
on
the
pan
fried
noodle
is
tasty
.
Dumplings
are
quite
good.We
order
from
Chang
Jiang
often
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.
The
menu
is
huge
,
and
can
accomodate
anyone
's
taste
buds
.
The
service
is
quick
,
usually
ready
in
10
minutes.Grade
:
C
The
food
is
almost
as
good
as
the
prices
.
Decent
service.I
have
never
eaten
at
the
Green
Lantern
,
but
whatever
.
What
I
HAVE
done
is
gone
to
karaoke
there
.
I
am
not
the
kind
of
person
to
enjoy
a
``
hip
''
bar
.
I
do
n't
want
ironic
metal
on
the
jukebox
or
$
8
flirtinis
.
What
I
want
is
totally
unpretentious
karaoke
renditions
of
Unskinny
Bop
from
people
that
still
look
like
they
graduated
high
school
in
1991
,
and
$
2.50
vodka
and
cranberry
juices.I
'm
sure
if
I
drove
far
enough
outside
of
Minneapolis
I
'd
find
a
place
about
as
awesome
as
the
Green
Lantern
.
Instead
of
doing
all
of
that
work
,
I
just
wish
the
Green
Lantern
would
move
into
my
backyard
.
I
HATE
bars
where
I
feel
like
I
have
to
do
a
lot
of
work
just
to
try
to
have
a
good
time
.
I
'm
not
dressing
up
or
drinking
a
certain
drink
just
to
feel
like
I
have
a
shot
of
being
accepted
somewhere
,
believe
me
.
The
Green
Lantern
rules
because
it
's
completely
laid
back
and
totally
unpretentious
.
I
've
seen
such
a
wide
variety
of
people
there
and
everyone
is
always
having
a
great
time
.
Besides
,
the
drinks
are
super
strong
and
cheap
-
that
alone
is
good
enough
for
me.The
biggest
plus
is
it
is
on
the
lake
with
a
dock
and
open
for
breakfest
.
That
is
huge
if
your
a
fan
of
a
boating
trip
to
eat
...
I
'll
swing
by
soon
to
actually
eat
there
again
...
it
's
been
3
years
since
we
had
a
boat
.
We
did
find
a
used
boat
...
now
we
may
return
.
I
guess
that
says
a
lot
as
without
the
boat
,
we
do
not
go
,
with
a
boat
,
its
a
6
out
of
5
stars
!!!!
Who
does
not
love
the
Greeny
?
As
some
posts
before
me
it
is
a
place
you
can
go
and
have
a
good
time
no
matter
what
and
just
be
you
.
The
staff
is
awesome
and
the
food
is
decent
.
But
the
Green
lantern
has
something
that
other
places
try
to
imitate
,
atmosphere
.
I
have
seen
bar
after
bar
try
and
create
a
fun
atmosphere
but
they
can
not
.
The
Greeny
has
it
and
I
wish
I
could
get
there
more
than
I
do.The
Green
Lantern
is
the
kind
of
place
that
comes
in
right
above
the
Mendoza
Line
.
What
I
mean
by
this
is
the
quality
of
the
meals
and
the
atmosphere
of
this
supper
club
is
good
enough
to
warrant
return
visits
but
not
to
elicit
rave
reviews
.
I
'm
not
a
supper
club
kind
of
guy
,
so
right
off
the
bat
a
place
like
the
Green
Lantern
is
n't
going
to
be
my
favorite
.
However
there
are
plenty
of
old
school
supper
clubs
that
do
a
nice
enough
job
that
I
've
got
no
qualms
tagging
along
for
dinner
on
a
Friday
night
.
The
Green
Lantern
is
one
of
these
places
,
albeit
just
barely
.
My
friend
,
however
,
absolutely
loves
this
place
.
As
such
I
've
had
cause
to
dine
here
many
times
over
the
years
.
There
are
quite
a
few
pluses
.
The
bartenders
are
quick
and
generally
friendly
,
and
they
've
got
an
adequate
tap
selection
including
Ale
Asylum
offerings
.
I
love
the
location
right
off
the
lake
,
and
two-thirds
of
the
seating
areas
have
great
atmosphere
.
The
service
has
always
been
above
average
and
I
ca
n't
think
of
a
bad
experience
-
this
type
of
consistency
over
the
years
is
very
hard
to
maintain
.
They
've
got
Wiggies
,
which
are
kind
of
like
low-rent
roesti
-
hashbrowns
with
onions
,
peppers
and
American
cheese
.
And
finally
the
Green
Lantern
is
obviously
popular
with
the
denizens
of
McFarland
.
I
do
n't
recall
a
single
trip
out
here
where
the
bar
was
n't
mostly
full
and
the
restaurant
hopping
.
The
negatives
:
first
and
foremost
I
've
always
found
the
menu
to
be
pretty
limited
.
I
'm
not
big
on
fish
fry
,
and
the
Green
Lantern
's
Friday
night
menu
does
n't
have
much
else
aside
from
sandwiches
and
a
grilled
chicken
breast
entree
.
Now
as
I
said
,
I
'm
not
big
on
fish
fry
so
my
opinion
should
be
taken
lightly
,
but
the
times
that
I
have
ordered
the
fish
I
've
been
underwhelmed
.
This
is
probably
just
me
-
my
friend
simply
ca
n't
get
enough
of
the
stuff
.
Prices
are
moderately
high
for
the
perceived
quality
,
though
the
bar
is
quite
reasonable
.
There
's
also
a
bit
of
a
hassle
when
it
comes
to
paying
the
bill
.
While
I
've
never
had
any
concerns
with
service
from
the
waitstaff
,
I
have
stood
around
for
upwards
of
15
minutes
waiting
to
have
the
hostess
swipe
my
card
.
That
is
unacceptable
and
it
's
unfortunately
led
to
smaller
tips
to
otherwise
deserving
waitresses
.
Finally
,
it
always
seems
that
after
waiting
20-30
minutes
for
a
table
on
a
Friday
night
we
always
end
up
either
in
the
basement
or
at
one
of
the
few
poorly
located
tables
upstairs
.
If
it
were
just
up
to
me
I
do
n't
think
I
'd
be
going
to
the
Green
Lantern
all
that
much
.
After
all
,
I
do
n't
live
in
McFarland
and
I
do
n't
really
go
for
supper
club
fish
fries
.
But
so
long
as
I
know
people
that
love
going
here
I
'll
tag
along
and
have
a
decent
enough
time
.
I
think
you
'd
be
hard
pressed
not
to
at
least
be
able
to
do
that
at
the
Green
Lantern.We
ate
there
several
weeks
back
so
the
details
are
a
bit
thin
,
but
I
do
recall
that
the
service
was
good
and
we
enjoyed
the
burger
,
club
sandwich
,
and
ham
and
cheese
our
group
had
.
Its
exactly
what
you
'd
expect
for
a
good
supper
club.Under
ordinary
circumstances
I
'm
not
a
breakfast
person
.
However
,
the
morning
after
Thanksgiving
,
it
was
obviously
time
to
consume
more
food
,
so
off
to
the
Green
Lantern
we
went
.
And
a
good
thing
too
...
I
had
the
best
breakfast
I
have
eaten
in
recent
memory
,
and
left
totally
impressed
-LRB-
and
full
-RRB-
.
Breakfast
foods
are
simple
foods
.
Many
places
take
advantage
of
the
simplicity
by
rushing
things
along
.
You
end
up
with
edible
but
uninspired
eats
.
Though
my
breakfast
arrived
shortly
after
it
was
ordered
,
it
was
cooked
properly
and
with
care
.
My
sunny
side
up
eggs
were
perfectly
done
,
the
whites
well
set
and
the
yolks
warm
but
properly
runny
.
The
four
-LRB-
!
-RRB-
large
slices
of
bacon
were
thick
and
flavorful
.
I
ordered
the
hash-browns
crispy
,
and
that
's
how
they
came
.
Everything
on
the
plate
was
cooked
just
right
and
tasted
super
good
.
I
could
almost
like
eating
breakfast
out
,
if
every
place
served
breakfast
like
this
.
Service
was
fast
and
friendly
.
Coffee
was
the
usual
diner
style
,
weak
and
plentiful
.
The
bar
looked
capable
of
producing
a
solid
bloody
mary
,
but
alas
this
went
untested
.
Prices
were
as
cheap
as
the
day
is
long
.
I
'm
docking
a
star
for
the
corn
beef
hash
--
it
lacked
flavor
and
that
all
important
crunch
.
All
the
same
,
I
still
highly
recommend
the
Lantern
for
your
breakfast
needs.Ate
breakfast
here
today
;
overall
a
really
good
atmosphere
and
some
tasty
items
on
the
menu
.
I
would
recommend
their
Wiggies
,
a
hodgepodge
of
hash
browns
,
cheese
,
green
peppers
,
diced
ham
,
and
mushrooms
.
I
topped
it
off
with
a
mimosa
and
then
my
gf
and
I
strolled
out
onto
their
dock
and
enjoyed
some
lakeside
scene.We
love
The
Green
Lantern
.
The
food
is
wonderful
and
the
price
is
great
.
We
have
never
had
a
long
wait
for
a
table
and
once
we
are
seated
we
are
always
waited
on
right
away
.
All
the
staff
is
very
friendly
and
atmosphere
is
welcoming
.
We
have
taken
several
friends
here
for
dinner
and
always
have
a
great
time.We
love
this
place
!
This
restaurant
has
excellent
food
!
It
has
been
family
owned
for
years
and
that
is
what
makes
the
difference
.
Love
being
regulars
here
!
Friday
night
fish
fries
are
always
good
.
Scallops
are
really
worth
trying
.
Salads
are
always
fresh
.
Chili
is
very
thick
and
meaty
.
This
place
and
staff
are
always
welcoming
even
when
you
arrive
by
boat
!
Highly
recommend
it
.
Be
sure
to
check
out
their
specials
on
their
awesome

I

Cons
:
Scallops

outdated
walleye

was
eh
,
not
enough
flavors
It
's
very
Divey
,
not
impressed
even
when
my
meal
was
free.We
accidentally
found
Green
Lantern
when
another
local
eatery
was
closed
for
Sunday
night
.
We
could
n't
have
been
more
happy
that
the
other
place
was
closed
as
Green
Lantern
had
friendly
service
,
tasty
food
,
and
the
Packers
on
tv
screens
everywhere
you
looked
.
It
's
a
restaurant
and
bar
,
and
the
building
is
n't
modern
,
so
leave
any
judgmental
aesthetic
attitudes
at
home
-LRB-
or
,
in
our
case
,
the
hotel
room
-RRB-
and
go
enjoy

reasonable

and
good

.
Go
with
the
standards
and
you
will
enjoy!This
place
is
like
an
old
up-north
supper
club
.
It
's
dark
and
cozy
with
orange
light
lanterns
hanging
from
the
ceiling
.
The
upper
seating
level
has
a
lovely
view
of
the
lake
.
I
got
the
lobster
omelet
and
it
had
this
wonderful
,
flavorful
tarragon
sauce
over
the
top
.
Big
chunks
of
lobster
made
it
a
memorable
breakfast
.
My
english
muffin
was
perfectly
toasted
and
buttered
.
My
companion
recommends
trying
the
walleye
breakfast
next
time
.
Our
server
was
very
very
very
nice
and
sweet
.
Several
times
she
uttered
``
take
your
time
,
no
hurry
.
''
I
hear
that
's
the
Green
Lantern
's
tag
line
:
loitering
encouraged
.
I
like
to
relax
,
so
this
place
is
perfect
.
If
I
lived
in
the
area
I
'd
go
there
for
drinks.Never
had
a
bad
meal
here
,
breakfast
lunch
or
dinner
.
Prices
are
very
reasonable
and
the
people
are
very
welcoming
.
One
thing
that
needs
improvement
is
the
coffee
.
I
think
they
let
the
hot
water
wink
at
the
grounds

and
it
's
a
great
place
for
fish
fry.FISH
FRY
was
OUT
OF
THIS
WORLD
!
I
read
an
article
in
Madison
magazine
about
how
this
place
had
one
of
the
best
fish
fry
's
in
town
and
decided
to
try
it
out
!
What
a
gem
!
First
,
The
fish
fry
comes
with
salad
and
a
side
.
Super
Nice
.
Secondly
,
they
must
have
the
world
's
best
tartar
sauce
!
I
could
literally
drink
the
stuff
.
Third
,
I
took
five
people
here
who
all
had
the
fish
fry
and
drinks
and
it
only
set
me
back
60
Bucks
!
WOW
!
I
will
be
back!The
man
and
I
are
on
this
thing
now
where
we
are
trying
to
eat
at
a
few
places
famous
for
their
fish
fry
's
thanks
to
an
article
in
Madison
Magazine
.
There
are
a
few
places
in
the
mag
that
I
am
looking
forward
to
trying
but
Green
Lantern
was
the
first
one
that
we
hit
up
.
Driving
up
the
place
looked
kind
of
small
and
beat
up
which
was
not
what
I
was
expecting
and
not
looking
forward
to
.
As
we
got
closer
however
I
realized
how
big
this
place
was
on
the
inside
.
It
's
huge
!
At
least
it
felt
huge
from
where
we
were
sitting
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
it
was
the
article
in
the
magazine
that
attributed
to
how
crazy
busy
this
place
was
or
if
there
was
a
concert
or
what
but
this
place
was
insane
.
I
mean
we
had
to
wait
for
an
hour
for
our
table
.
On
the
plus
side
we
had
to
wait
an
hour
for
our
table
which
meant
an
hour
of
drinking
so
I
ca
n't
really
complain
.
Because
we
had
been
waiting
for
so
long
we
also
had
a
chance
to
look
at
the
menu
so
when
we
finally
sat
down
we
knew
exactly
what
we
wanted
;
the
waitress
loved
this
.
We
started
with
the
calamari
which
I
'm
starting
to
find
out
is
not
one
of
Wisconsin
's
strong
suits
.
I
do
n't
think
I
have
ever
had
good
calamari
here
;
maybe
this
will
be
my
next
food
challenge
`
The
Great
Calamari
Showdown
'
!
Anyway
,
I
had
a
few
pieces
of
that
and
let
the
man
have
the
rest
''
he
actually
really
liked
it
.
I
ordered
the
salad
which
was
huge
,
cheesy
mashed
potato
,
and
3
pieces
of
the
lightly
breaded
cod
.
The
man
order
the
same
but
with
cheesy
hash
browns
.
The
fish
was
pretty
good
.
It
was
juicy
and
fresh
and
not
bad
.
I
thought
it
was
maybe
just
a
little
over
the
top
with
the
seasoning
.
I
think
I
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
the
flavors
were
a
bit
more
subtle
as
opposed
to
all
up
in
my
face
the
way
it
was
.
With
that
said
however
I
though
it
was
alright
.
The
man
on
the
other
hand
was
in
love
.
He
likened
his
enjoyment
of
this
place
to
the
Tornado
Room
.
Pure
blasphemy
.
He
clearly
does
n't
know
anything
about
food
.
All
in
all
I
am
glad
I
tried
this
place
but
I
do
n't
think
I
will
be
making
it
a
regular
haunt.Stopped
in
for
a
dinner
after
getting
a
recommendation
from
a
co
worker
and
we
were
VERY
impressed
!
It
was
fairly
quiet
on
a
Thursday
night
-
no
problem
getting
a
table
.
The
location
is
fabulous
being
right
on
the
lake
with
views
.
The
ambiance
is
very
much
a
north-woods
tavern
restaurant
type
establishment
-
older
decor
,
a
little
kitschy
,
though
it
suits
the
place
,
well
.
Green
Lantern
has
a
reputation
of
being
a
surf-turf
and
they
do
it
well
!
I
had
the
Ahi-tuna
-
it
was
an
incredibly
delicate
piece
of
fish
cooked
perfectly
.
My
wife
had
a
steak
which
was
also
prepared
very
well
.
We
are
DEFINITELY
coming
back
!
The
server
,
while
young
and
a
bit
`
nervous
'
,
did
a
fine
job
and
she
was
very
pleasant
.
She
also
provided
great
suggestions
for
food
pairings
!
Well
done
:-RRB-
Hint
:
Ask
for
a
seat
by
the
window
to
get
a
view
of
the
lake
.

Been

Once
for
breakfast
and
few
times
for

.
Food
has
been
very
good
and
the
service
is
decent

They
do
n't
have
the
best
view
of
the
lake
but
we
'll
still
be
back.Any
place
that
's
located
on
a
lake
for
a
fish
fry
is
alright
with
me
.
.
It
's
packed
on
Friday
which
means
you
get
to
have
a
few
cocktails
while
waiting
for
a
table
,
the

it

last
Friday
to
try
the
famous
fish
fry
.
Arrived
at
5:50
pm
and
was
quoted
a
25-30
minute
wait
,
which
I
found
acceptable
.
We
were
not
called
until
55
minutes
later
,
and
this
only
happened
when
I
brought
my
two
young
sons
and
sat
on
the
floor
conspicuously
in
plain
view
of
the
host
stand
.
At
that
point
we
were
offered
the
``
quick
alternative
''
of
a
table
downstairs
.
Where
was
this
option
earlier
?
Look
,
we
knew
going
out
on
the
first
Friday
of
lent
would
result
in
a
wait
and
we
brought
a
myriad
of
distractions
along
to
kill
time
for
our
4
and
2
year
olds
.
Those
wear
thin
,
however
,
when
the
wait
is
double
what
you
are
initially
told
and
have
subsequently
relayed
to
the
kids
.
Maybe
this
is
all
due
to
an
inexperienced
host
.
Our
server
was
very
attentive
and
the
food
was
good
.
We
tried
the
baked
,
beer-battered
,
and
fried
fish
.
We
also
had
baked
potatoes
and
french
fries
as
well
as
salads
.
Overall
,
this
was
not
the
best
Madison
has
to
offer
.
We
may
return
,
but
would
only
due
so
as
a
just
a
couple
or
as
a
family
if
we
could
arrive
before
the
rush.The
Lantern
does
n't
profess
to
be
anything
more
than
it
is
.
Good
American
,
wisco
supper

.
Prices
are
very
good
,
and
they
know
how
to
cook
a
steak

Bloody

's
are
great
as
they
allow
you
to

Decent

They

Very
good
at

Also

Solid
choice
,
and
nicest
place
on
lake
waubesa.We
went
to
the
Green
Lantern
last
Friday
and
it
was
our
first
visit
there.Several
of
our
friends
had
always
spoken
highly
of
it
so
we
thought
we
would
give
their
Friday
Fish
fry
a
try
.
I
had
made
reservations
for
us
and
when
we
got
to
the
restaurant
they
informed
us
it
would
just
be
a
few
more
minutes
and
that
we
could
take
a
seat
at
the
bar.The
bartender
was
very
nice
and
intuitive
,
he
noticed
I
was
eying
up
the
pickled
mushrooms
and
gave
me
some
for
my
cocktail.A
few
minutes
later
we
were
promptly
seated
so
the
wait
was
not
long
at
all.We
were
seated
at
a
nice
table
by
the
window
with
a
view
of
the
lake.So
far
so
good.We
ordered
a
kalamari
appetizer
to
share
,
three
beer
battered
cod
fish
fry
dinners
and
one
breaded
shrimp
dinner.The
kalamari
came
first
and
it
was
ok
.
Our
drinks
were
finished
so
we
ordered
more.Finally
she
came
with
our
entrees
but
still
no
beer
we
had
ordered
to
go
with
our
meals.So
we
reminded
her
again.My
fish
fry
was
warm
and
the
fish
was
flaky.My
moms
fish
fry
,
however
,
was
cold
and
soggy
and
we
had
ordered
the
same
thing.The
cole
slaw
was
good
and
tasted
fresh
and
the
hash
browns
I
had
ordered
were
good
as
well.My
partners
shrimp
though
was
awful.It
was
greasy
and
mushy
and
tasted
awful.The
French
fries
accompanying
it
were
undercooked
and
looked
anemic
,
some
of
them
had
black
coloring
on
them
like
the
bad
part
of
a
potato
that
has
rotted.Our
server
was
still
no
where
to
be
seen
in
order
to
ask
about
our
drinks
or
inform
her
about
the
cold
fish
,
soggy
shrimp
and
undercooked
fries.Finally
we
asked
another
waitress
if
she
could
find
her.When
we
told
her
we
were
disappointed
in
the
food
,
particularily
the
shrimp
and
undercooked
potatoes
she
asked
why
we
had
n't
told
her
sooner
,
to
which
I
really
wanted
to
respond
that
not
once
did
she
check
in
with
us
to
see
how
our
meal
was.She
did
handle
it
all
professionally
in
the
end
and
apologized
,
even
took
half
off
of
our
bill
so
that
was
nice.However
,
between
one
of
us
having
basically
no
good
entree
at
all
and
this
being
our
first
time
there
it
really
was
a
disappointment.Like
I
said
the
hashbrowns
and
coleslaw
were
good
,
the
bartender
and
hostess
service
was
good
but
we
came
there
for
a
good
fish
fry
and
dinner
service.Next
time
we
are
going
to
Tobys
nearby
instead.They
consistently
serve
quality
food
along
with
good
service.What
could
I
possibly
say
about
the
Beach
House
Restaurant
and
Lounge
?
I
guess
I
could
think
of
a
few
things
.
I
went
there
today
for
the
first
time
and
was
dazzled
by
the
charm
it
flaunted
,
while
still
maintaining
the
gritty
edge
of
a
backwoods
Wisconsin
eatery
.
Let
's
not
get
it
twisted
folks
,
we
're
not
breaking
gastronomic
ground
here
.
What
we
are
breaking
are
your
misconceptions
of
what
a
restaurant
can
be
whose
parking
lot
is
largely
composed
of
Chevy
and
Dodge
trucks
,
and
whose
front
,
snow-covered
,
lawn
is
full
of
snowmobiles
.
Deal
with
it
kids
,
this
is
that
slice
of
Midwest
Americana
you
've
been
looking
for
in
any
number
of
wayside
eateries
in
rural
America
.
Fish
fry
anyone
?
To
begin
,
let
me
explain
that
one
of
the
many
draws
for
the
Beach
House
's
patrons
is
the
fact
that
it
is
still
legal
to
smoke
indoors
in
McFarland
.
I
stepped
inside
and
was
immediately
made
aware
of
this
fact
as
plumes
of
smoke
took
up
residence
in
my
clothes
and
nose
.
Do
not
fear
,
however
,
there
is
a
separate
dining
room
that
is
nonsmoking
.
And
man
was
this
separate
dining
room
packed
-LRB-
Superbowl
Sunday
-RRB-
.
Packed
with
large
women
squeezing
into
convention
center
chairs
.
Packed
with
waitresses
who
wore
skin
tight
white
Jordache
jeans
,
giving
you
a
fleeting
sense
of
their
giving
nature
.
Packed
with
the
eager
anticipation
of
an
entire
day
spent
watching
football
and
football-related
activities
:
drooling
,
eating
,
drinking
,
and
smoking
.
God
bless
America
.
The
AM
dish
to
get
here
is
the
Walleye
and
eggs
breakfast
.
I
would
tend
to
agree
,
although
their
limited
selection
of
omelets
is
made
marginally
more
tasty
by
the
addition
of
broccoli
-LRB-
you
heard
me
punk
-RRB-
.
As
breakfast
wore
on
,
the
dining
room
filled
,
emptied
,
and
filled
again
;
the
waitstaff
eagerly
setting
new
places
,
removing
paper
place
settings
,
calling
people
darlin
'
and
hon
'
-LRB-
always
appreciated
-RRB-
.
So
give
it
to
me
hard
backwoods
Wisconsin
.
Give
me
every
sinew
of
your
being
:
your
ice
fishing
,
snowmobiling
,
smoking
,
bloody
Mary
drinking
,
being
.
Just
be
.
And
give
me
a
friggin
'
huge
piece
of
deep
fried
walleye
to
help
me
digest
the
spectacle
,
with
scrambled
eggs
on
the
side
.
And
do
n't
you
dare
forget
the
tartar
sauce.Service
was
terrible
!
I
will
never
return
!!!
We
waited
in
the
bar
and
were
never
greeted
or
spoken
too
.
People
walked
in
after
us
and
were
seated
.
Not
sure
what
their
structure
is
for
seating
,
but
they
suck
at
it
.
I
will
not
be
back.This
place
is
pretty
dumpy
-
``
Corinthian
leather
''
chairs
,
crappy
tables
...
What
is
worth
going
for
is
the
walleye
and
eggs
served
on
weekends
.
It
is
a
HUGE
portion
of
walleye
,
lighty
fried
,
served
with
eggs
cooked
to
order
,
potatoes
and
toast
.
All
this
for
something
like
$
10
.
Totally
worth
a
side
trip
if
you
are
in
Madison.Amazing
Friday
night
FISH
FRY
!
I
got
out
a
lot
for
fish
fry
's
in
Madison
and
the
surrounding
area
and
this
still
remains
my
favorite
.
I
usually
get
the
Cod
dinner
,
which
is
always
cooked
perfect
,
not
too
soggy
or
too
crispy
,
which
comes
with
a
side
AND
a
soup
or
salad
for
only
$
9.95
.
I
always
recommend
the
Beach
House
when
someone
is
looking
for
a
GREAT
fish
fry
!
:
-RRB-
For
being
surrounded
by
two
lakes
,
Madison
does
n't
do
a
great
job
of
having
places
to
drink
on
the
water
.
Head
down
to
McFarland
and
check
out
the
beach
house
.
It
's
like
a
dive
bar
slash
restaurant
right
on
the
lake
.
Tons
of
windows
.
Not
a
bad
place
.
Ca
n't
comment
on
the
food
.
Drink
specials
were
solid.This
place
has
good
steaks
,
and
fish
fry
.
I
also
like
the
saturday
special
bacon
wrapped
filet
,
with
lobster
tail
,
all
for
24.99
I
think
?
All
the
dinners
come
with
soup
or
salad
,
potato
choic
,
warm
rolls
w
/
butter
.
Walleye
,
cod
,
bluegill
are
all
delecious
.
Good
place
for
a
beer
as
well
.
Great
view
,
and
drink
specials
.
This
is
a
real
Sconnie
place
,
Wisco
to
the
core
.
My
fave
Fish
Fry
spot
for
sure.I
have
not
Yelped
in
quite
a
while
and
to
all
my
fans
-LRB-
all
none
of
you
-RRB-
...
sorry
.
So
I
will
start
on
a
positive
note
...
So
I
have
been
to
the
Beach
House
so
many
times
I
feel
dumb
reviewing
it
but
I
am
so
deal
with
it
and
go
there
.
If
you
are
going
for
drinks
...
do
it
.
The
clientele
is
awesome
and
you
will
always
hear
some
great
stories
.
But
this
review
is
for
the
food
.
ALWAYS
AMAZING
!
We
went
for
breakfast
the
other
day
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
and
it
was
as
good
as
I
remember
.
The
Eggs
Benedict
are
just
delicious
and
something
I
could
eat
every
day
and
they
make
one
hell
of
a
Bloody
Mary
-LRB-
so
I
am
told
by
my
wife
since
I
do
not
like
them
-RRB-
if
your
interest
in
that
.
So
if
you
want
some
good
breakfast
on
the
weekend
and
in
the
McFarland
area
...
Breach
House
it
is!Nasty
&
Dirty
.
Food
is
okay
.
They
do
a
great
steak
.
The
place
is
full
of
regulars
drinking
cheap
beer.We
had
dinner
at
the
Beach
House
on
Friday
on
our
way
up
to
northern
Wisconsin
based
on
reviews
on
Yelp
.
If
you
are
looking
for
good
fish
fry
the
Beach
House
has
it
.
I
had
the
perch
which
was
great
,
my
bf
had
the
walleye
which
i
think
had
an
even
better
flavor
.
The
fish
deserves
5
stars
.
Everything
else
a
3
star
.
I
would
give
3 1/2
stars
if
that
were
an
option
.
Would
definitely
go
back.I
really
wanted
to
like
this
place
but
it
was
n't
what
we
were
looking
for
.
They
have
a
great
spot
on
the
lake
but
it
is
a
pretty
dumpy
little
fish
shanty
.
If
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
,
you
will
love
it
.
There
were
a
bunch
of
locals
there
having
a
good
time
and
if
we
were
there
with
a
group
of
our
friends
it
might
be
ok
for
a
few
beers
.
But
still
way
way
too
crowded
.
Like
sardines
in
a
can
.
There
was
no
one
to
greet
us
so
we
just
took
a
table
by
the
window
.
Then
we
waited
and
waited
.
Then
someone
came
over
and
said
hi
.
Then
we
waited
and
waited
.
I
was
about
to
get
up
and
leave
when
someone
came
over
and
said
,
``
oh
,
you
have
n't
been
waited
on
yet
?
''
So
she
then
tried
to
help
things
along
.
The
menu
was
average
for
sandwiches
but
overpriced
,
we
felt
,
for
entrees
as
we
ordered
the
Ahi
Tuna
and
the
Bluegill
.
The
Tuna
was
very
good
and
perhaps
appropriately
priced
but
the
Bluegill
was
not
proportionately
enough
.
It
was
made
well
enough
and
had
ok
flavor
but
should
have
been
a
few
dollars
less
.
Salad
was
ok
.
At
least
had
a
variety
of
greens
but
still
needed
a
little
more
.
If
I
ever
went
back
it
would
be
for
a
few
beers
and
the
view
,
that
's
it
.
It
's
too
bad
because
we
really
need
some
nice
places
on
the
lake
and
with
all
the
lakes
around
here
there
are
n't
as
many
lakeside
restaurants
as
you
would
expect.This
is
the
quintessential
mom
and
pop
bar
/
restaurant
on
a
lake
.
They
specialize
in
cheap
beer
and
great
food
.
Staff
is
friendly
and
down
home
,
but
you
'd
better
leave
your
big-city
attitude
at
home
.
We
went
for
a
Friday
night
fish
fry
.
I
live
in
Seattle
these
days
and
was
not
about
to
miss
the
opportunity
while
in
town
.
Started
with
a
couple
of
Spotted
Cows
-LRB-
on
tap
!
-RRB-
while
the
rest
drank
Miller
Lite
.
-LRB-
Told
ya
...
-RRB-
There
were
five
adults
plus
a
12-year
old
.
Walleye
was
excellent
,
the
waitress
was
too
.
We
made
reservations
and
the
table
was
ready
well
ahead
of
time
.
Our
one
tactical
error
was
sitting
in
the
bar
for
the
view
.
It
was
LOUD
!
Think
that
the
dining
room
is
much
quieter
.
Notice
that
I
am
not
saying
much
about
the
food
?
Here
's
the
deal
:
-
It
was
Friday
-
It
was
Hot
-
The
beer
was
Cold
-
The
fish
fry
was
exactly
what
you
would
expect
in
a
place
like
this
:
great
walleye
!
`
Nough
said
...
We
live
just
down
from
the
Beach
House
.
We
love
going
there
.
They
are
super
friendly
.
We
usually
do
not
have
to
wait
to
be
seated
.
The
weekend
breakfasts
are
the
best
.
Bloody
Marys
are
outstanding
.
Love
the
crab
cakes
eggs
Benedict
.
Yum
!
Huge
portion
of
walleye
with
your
eggs
which
is
one
of
my
friends
favs
when
they
come
visit
.
It
is
a
great
local
hangout
too
,
beautiful
view
,
easy
parking
for
your
boat
from
lake
waubesa
.
We
recommend
it
always!Now
I
must
state
one
little
thing
about
the
way
I
rate
restaurants
.
My
ratings
are
relative
to
my
expectations
of
the
experience
and
in
no
way
relative
to
other
restaurants
,
-LRB-
it
just
is
n't
fair
to
use
the
same
scale
for
a
place
like
the
Beach
House
as
you
would
for
The
French
Laundry
so
again
,
it
's
all
relative
-RRB-
I
've
only
been
here
for
breakfast
but
the
second
time
I
drove
a
long
damn
way
to
have
breakfast
again
so
that
in
and
of
it
self
should
say
something
.
-LRB-
another
caveat
:
there
are
maybe
six
restaurants
in
McFarland
that
do
n't
have
drive-thrus
-RRB-
I
ordered
the
Walleye
and
eggs
both
times
along
with
a
bloody
mary
-LRB-
got
ta
love
a
beer
back
,
yay
for
Wisconsin
-RRB-
.
Now
I
am
well
aware
of
the
number
of
bones
that
a
whole
Walleye
contains
and
can
not
in
any
way
hold
the
Beach
House
responsible
for
that
.
I
can
say
that
the
breading
was
perfectly
crispy
and
well
seasoned
and
that
the
fish
was
not
at
all
over
cooked
,
nice
and
moist
.
plus
I
think
it
cost
$
10
which
was
awesome
-LRB-
you
ca
n't
get
fish
for
breakfast
at
these
prices
in
Chicago
-RRB-
For
me
the
biggest
highlight
of
breakfast
here
is
what
they
do
to
the
potatoes
-LRB-
their
name
for
them
is
eluding
me
at
the
moment
-RRB-
by
request
they
will
top
your
breakfast
potatoes
with
a
heap
of
meat
,
veggies
and
cheese
,
enough
to
make
it
a
hangover-soaking-up
meal
unto
itself
.
To
sum
it
all
up
:
if
you
find
yourself
looking
for
breakfast
and
a
little
``
hair
o
'
the
dog
''
in
McFarland
Wisconsin
because
``
What
happens
at
the
Beach
House
,
stays
at
the
Beach
House
''
and
we
all
love
that
about
any
restaurant.I
use
to
boat
in
this
area
alot
.
I
always
made
this
place
to
stop
for
breakfast
.
very
good
.
They
are
know
for
there
Walleys
and
eggs
,
Some
people
even
like
a
bloody
mary
or
vodka
and
orange
served
with
them
.
Anything
on
the
menu
is
good
.
Nice
place
on
the
water
.
You
can
come
by
boat
or
car
.
If
you
come
by
boat
a
nice
little
ride
over
to
Madison
area
makes
it
a
fun
day.We
love
the
Beach
House
.
We
come
here
often
.
Food
is
always
good
.
Drinks
are
made
by
some
really
awesome
people
!
Specials
are
always
worth
a
look
.
Weekend
breakfasts
are
very
popular
,
so
come
early
.
Try
the
walleye/eggs
.
Or
the
crab/eggs
benedict
.
Very
very
good
!!
Excellent
dinner
.
Had
a
New
York
Strip
steak
and
Scallops
for
$
22.00
Food
was
very
good
and
the
atmosphere
is
the
classic
divey
Wisconsin
bar
.
The
only
way
it
could
be
better
was
if
they
added
outdoor
service/outdoor
bar
.
We
will
be
back!I
've
been
to
this
place
a
couple
of
times
and
we
've
always
had
good
food
.
Service
was
a
bit
slow
,
but
will
definitely
keep
going
back
.
Love
being
so
close
to
Lake
Waubesa
and
watching
the
sunsets
too.Food
and
service
have
always
been
good
.
The
seafood
dinner
was
done
perfectly.The
Beach
house
is
probably
one
of
our
favorite
breakfast
places
.
The
walleye
and
eggs
are
truly
a
specialty
.
Their
fish
fry
is
also
very
good
and
they
have
a
nice
view
of
lake
Wabesa
.
If
they
expanded
food
and
drinks
outside
,
they
'd
have
a
5
star.I
got
a
Groupon
for
here
for
my
fiancee
and
mine
's
anniversary
,
and
we
finally
were
able
to
get
there
a
month
later
.
The
restaurant
was
super
easy
to
find
and
I
loved
how
it
was
right
on
the
lake
.
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
the
last
few
summers
in
northern
WI
on
a
lake
,
so
it
was
nice
to
be
back
on
a
lake
again
-
brought
back
good
memories
!
We
did
not
make
a
reservation
,
so
it
was
an
hour
wait
for
a
table
when
we
arrived
.
We
hung
out
in
the
slightly
crowded
bar
and
had
a
few
drinks
while
we
were
waiting
.
The
drinks
were
good
and
the
bartenders
were
attentive
,
so
no
complaints
there
!
We
were
seated
at
a
table
that
had
a
great
view
of
the
lake
.
They
had
lots
of
specials
going
on
that
night
-LRB-
Friday
night
fish
!
-RRB-
,
and
we
started
with
pepperjack
cheese
curds
.
Delish
!
They
had
a
really
nice
bite
at
the
end
of
them
from
the
peppers
.
I
got
the
blue
gill/lake
perch
combo
and
my
fiancee
got
the
Caribbean
salmon
.
I
know
blue
gill
is
a
thinner
fish
,
and
while
my
dish
was
good
,
there
was
not
a
lot
of
actual
fish
under
the
batter
.
I
got
a
salad
with
my
fish
with
a
tomato
basil
vinaigrette
,
which
was
surprisingly
good
and
coleslaw
which
was
pretty
standard
.
The
salmon
with
the
Caribbean
dipping
sauce
was
fantastic
,
but
the
veggies
he
got
as
a
side
was
just
some
steamed
broccoli
and
carrots
-
not
very
creative
!
Our
server
was
attentive
all
night
,
even
though
the
restaurant
was
super
busy
all
night
.
By
the
time
we
left
,
I
was
very
full
and
satisfied.Went
here
for
fish
fry
with
one
of
my
friends
and
we
ended
up
sitting
outside
and
watching
the
sunset
.
Our
server
was
very
nice
and
the
food
was
SOOOO
good
!
I
had
the
fried
cod
and
she
had
the
walleye
.
We
were
both
impressed
and
full
after
the
meal
.
My
favorite
part
-
the
price
-
very
affordable
and
you
get
to
pick
your
sides
,
which
were
also
really
good
,
american
fries
and
asparagus
.
I
'd
highly
recommend
and
I
'm
going
back!Stopped
here
while
on
a
Sunday
drive
.
Tried
sitting
outside
and
the
waitress
did
not
make
us
feel
welcomed
.
She
was
rude
and
careless
.
We
walked
inside
to
the
bar
where
the
bartenders
were
a
lot
better
.
Unfortunately
the
same
lady
came
in
and
started
venting
about
her
customers
.
Seems
like
they
have
enough
customers
and
do
not
need
to
be
nice
anymore
.
Too
bad
because
the
beer
was
nice
and
cold
.
Great
views
too.It
was
ok
-
waitress
was
very
good
-
even
with
7:45
Friday
night
reservations
no
tables
were
available
and
had
a
very
long
wait
-
drunk
patron
at
the
bar
swearing
very
loud
with
the
F-bomb
and
other
words
and
slamming
items
on
the
bar
-
first
ordered
the
salmon
special
and
of
course
it
was
already
sold
out
-
two
of
us
then
ordered
the
fish
fry
mine
was
lukewarm
and
the
other
one
was
cold
.
Do
n't
plan
on
going
back.I
took
my
mom
and
grandma
to
the
Beach
House
last
night
for
dinner
thinking
it
would
be
better
than
getting
a
Papa
Murphy
's
pizza
.
There
were
n't
many
patrons
in
the
dining
room
.
Our
waitress
was
very
short
with
us
,
demanding
our
drink
orders
before
taking
any
questions
or
orders
for
our
food
.
I
ordered
scallops
,
and
when
they
came
to
the
table
they
were
overcooked
,
but
also
cold
.
It
took
me
at
least
15
minutes
to
find
the
waitress
to
ask
if
I
could
get
warmer
food
.
She
said
that
she
would
have
the
kitchen
make
up
a
new
meal
,
and
about
15
minutes
later
she
returned
with
my
same
plate
,
with
my
original
fork
and
original
food
.
They
scallops
were
now
warm
,
but
lacked
flavor
,
and
were
even
tougher
than
before
.
The
waitress
did
n't
seem
to
care
about
the
quality
of
the
food
and
seemed
to
be
either
having
a
terrible
night
or
was
on
the
influence
of
something
.
Needless
to
say
,
I
will
not
be
returning
.
On
a
positive
note
,
the
sunset
on
the
lake
is
pretty.Later
in
the
night
,
not
very
crowded
yet
they
insisted
we
sit
crowded
next
to
another
pair
of
people
.
Service
was
slow
,
just
getting
a
drink
was
an
effort
.
Food
was
poorly
prepared
and
over
cooked
,
or
as
in
my
partners
case
cold
.
No
way
coming
back
other
than
drinks
in
the
summer.we
found
this
place
on
a
groupon
deal
and
were
excited
to
try
a
new
place
.
It
was
a
train
wreck
!
The
dining
area
was
not
very
busy
even
tho
it
was
a
Friday
night
fish
fry
.
That
should
have
been
our
first
clue
.
We
ordered
the
steak
and
lobster
,
The
steak
was
very
good
,
but
the
lobster
was
still
raw
.
We
sent
it
back
to
be
re
warmed
,
and
still
returned
undercooked
.
we
decided
to
take
it
``
to
go
''
and
finish
cooking
it
at
home.My
husband
and
I
love
our
bloody
marys
&
this
is
NOT
the
place
to
order
one
.
blah
.
Needless
to
say
,
we
will
not
be
back
,
nor
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
else.I
would
not
have
known
about
this
place
had
it
not
been
for
the
Holiday
Groupon
.
I
redeemed
mine
with
my
bf
over
the
weekend
,
and
the
food
was
delicious
and
cooked
well
-LRB-

Holiday
Groupon
pic
-RRB-
.
The
restaurant
was
packed
on
Saturday
night
;
I
'm
glad
I
called
in
a
reservation
.
Local
town
folk
.
Not
a
huge
place
but
still
cozy
.
The
servers
were
running
around
and
busy
but
made
sure
that
our
table
was
attended
well
.
Ask
for
Dee
Dee
;
she
's
a
trip
!
I
'll
be
back
again
for
more
food
once
the
snow
has
melted
to
try
the
other
items
on
the
menu.Ate
there
last
night
with
a
group
of
friends
.
The
waitstaff
was
friendly
,
but
that
was
pretty
much
the
only
good
thing
of
the
night
.
I
hate
french
onion
soup
that
was
so
salty
,
it
tasted
like
a
salt
lick
.
Plus
,
they
put
so
many
croutons
in
the
soup
,
I
was
only
actually
afforded
about
two
small
spoonfuls
of
soup
before
the
liquid
was
soaked
up
.
I
ordered
the
bluegill
for
my
main
dish
.
Being
an
avid
fisherman
,
I
can
appreciate
some
good
Wisconsin
bluegill
.
This
bluegill
,
however
,
was
not
good
.
It
was
cold
and
tasted
very
old
.
The
fries
that
went
along
with
it
were
also
extremely
salty
.
A
couple
people
in
the
group
said
their
food
was
okay
,
but
definitely
not
worth
a
trip
back
.
I
was
quite
bummed
about
this.It
you
're
basic
bar
food
.
Nothing
more.Great
place
on
the
water
.
Beautiful
views
.
Good
fish
fry
.
Very
reasonable
prices
with
nice
selection
of
fish
and
sides
.
The
staff
are
great!Do
you
like
it
when
your
bowels
want
to
explode
?
Then
this
is
the
place
for
you
.
The
sad
thing
is
,
the
aroma
coming
from
the
restaurant
is
hypnotizing
as
it
drifts
through
the
neighborhood
,
and
the
staff
is
really
nice
,
but
holy
jeebus
,
does
the
pizza
suck
.
Every
time
we
went
there
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
in
the
bathroom
.
Awful.Great
little
bar
,
friendly
bartenders
-LRB-
unlike
the
*
other
*
Spartan
-
ahem
!
-RRB-
and
super
pizza
.
A
little
on
the
smoky
side
,
except
for
a
one-day-per
week
smoke
free
Saturday
,
so
time
your
visits
accordingly
.
Decor
in
the
restaurant
could
use
some
updating
,
but
it
's
a
small-town
family
owned
joint
that
is
what
it
is
...
Spartan
Pizza
is
going
smoke-free
on
March
1
,
2010
,
well
ahead
of
the
ban
.
Way
to
go
,
Spartan
!!!
We
went
there
for
the
first
time
yesterday
,
and
I
would
definitely
recommend
Spartan
Pizza
.
Here
's
why
:
-
the
crust
is
thin
,
crunchy
on
the
bottom
,
chewy
on
top
-
the
sauce
is
sweet
and
savory
-
the
cheese
is
rich
and
delicious
-
the
veggies
were
fresh
and
tasty
We
ordered
the
Canadian
bacon
deluxe
-LRB-
with
onions
,
green
peppers
,
green
&
black
olives
,
and
mushroom
too
I
think
-RRB-
.
The
Canadian
bacon
tasted
like
real
meat
and
is
among
the
best
I
've
had
...
not
at
all
like
that
heavily
processed
stuff
you
usually
get
at
the
store
.
The
CBD
is
naturally
quite
salty
from
the
bacon
and
olives
but
I
like
that
.
We
also
had
the
small
salad
which
was
just
iceberg
lettuce
and
tomatoes
,
but
what
can
you
expect
for
$
2
?
I
'd
bet
the
pizza
salad
is
much
better
.
The
service
was
casual
and
friendly
.
In
regards
to
the
atmosphere
,
we
ate
in
the
parlor
booth
area
which
is
clean
enough
and
family-friendly
but
quite
dated
in
appearance
.
We
left
through
the
adjoining
room
which
is
a
bar
that
has
been
added
on
and
is
much
more
modern
and
was
populated
by
locals
drinking
and
eating
dinner
around
the
bar
.
I
should
also
note
that
the
plates
for
eating
pizza
are
plastic
.
This
is
a
``
no
frills
''
kind
of
place.Good
pizza
-LRB-
not
like
Pizza
Hut
,
more
like
home-made
-RRB-
with
a
great
bar
with
nice
,
friendly
service.Good
enough
for
carry-out
in
McFarland
on
a
cold
winter
's
evening
.
Ready
on
time
,
never
had
a
wrong
order
,
and
they
're
at
least
reasonably
friendly
.
Would
be
better
if
they
delivered
,
but
not
sure
there
's
a
huge
demand
for
it
in
our
tiny
burg
.
They
also
have
a
lunch
buffet
on
weekdays
for
around
$
6
.
Best
Chinese
food
madison
!
I
've
tried
them
all
and
make
the
15
minute
drive
every
week
:
-
-RRB-
Awful
,
awful
,
awful
...
The
worst
of
the
worst
of
the
cookie-cutter
Chinese
restaurants
.
Food
without
flavor
,
a
menu
without
imagination
and
a
staff
of
such
profound
indifference
it
's
hard
to
tell
they
're
even
there.Tried
this
because
it
's
local
.
Terrible
,
bland
Chinese
food
.
Not
much
else
to
say
.
Will
never
return
.
My
wife
wanted
me
to
mention
her
sweet
and
sour
chicken
,
which
was
battered
fried
chicken
pieces
with
a
side
of
sauce
in
a
bowl
.
When
she
asked
where
the
vegetables
were
-LRB-
like
the
picture
-RRB-
,
she
was
told
there
is
a
piece
of
pineapple
in
the
sauce
and
that
is
what
comes
with
it
.
As
promised
,
we
looked
hard
into
the
sauce
and
found
one
very
small
piece
of
pineapple
.
Bon
Appetite.Main

No

it

Freshly

Do

order
from
you

The
staff
is
so
friendly
,
I
'm
thinking
about
proposing
in
the
near
future
,
as
I
hope
to
be
a
part
of
their
family
like
they
've

a
part

mine

I
just
ca

I

up

Their

Do

fair

you
learn

decent

Authentic
good
quality
food
in
an
old
style
Chinese
restaurant
setting
.
Very
satisfied
overall
with
my
first
visit
.
Second
visit
included
my
six
year
old
which
was
not
so
good
,
they
do
n't
even
have
crayons
for
a
child.This
is
a
good
Chinese
place
.
Will
it
take
you
to
a
place
you
've
never
been
?
No
.
But
you
will
leave
satisfied.Food
:
It
's
overall
pretty
good
and
probably
one
of
the
more
reliable
options
for
semi-authentic
Chinese
food
in
the
Madison
area
.
To
this
Asian
,
there
is
definitely
some
catering
to
Western
palates
.
Definitely
a
step
down
if
you
're
used
to
eating
at
,
say
,
Chicago
's
Chinatown
-LRB-
both
old
and
new
sections
-RRB-
,
and
there
's
no
extra
menu
in
Chinese
with
the
more
eclectic
stuff
.
Fresh
seafood
options
very
limited
.
Service
:
Average
.
Food
comes
in
a
reasonable
time
,
though
refiling
the
water
sometimes
is
spotty
.
Value
:
Reasonable
overall
.
Prices
fit
the
portions
.
Most
entrees
$
9-15
range
.
Overall
:
Good
for
when
you
crave
Chinese
,
but
I
'd
still
head
to
Chicago
for
the
more
authentic
stuff.Three
stars
=
A-OK
.
It
was
fine
.
It
was
n't
great
.
This
place
has
been
here
for
about
30
years
.
Before
that
it
was
a
car
wash
.
I
always
think
of
it
as
the
place
that
used
to
be
a
carwash
.
Anyway
.
Went
with
a
group
of
15
.
Mom
was
buying
and
we
got
the
``
Classic
''
banquet
-LRB-
the
cheapest
one
-RRB-
.
It
was
more
food
than
we
could
eat
.
The
food
was
fine
.
Not
awesome
.
The
best
flavor
was
hoisin
sauce
and
,
well
,
that
comes
out
of
a
jar
.
We
got
a
sesame
chicken
that
had
nicely
deepfried
chicken
chunks
in
a
citrus-y
sweet
sauce
.
Some
trout
that
my
sister
insisted
on
and
really
enjoys
-LRB-
not
my
thing
,
but
everyone
else
liked
it
-RRB-
.
Mu-shu
pork
-
it
was
good
.
Delightful
-LRB-
?
-RRB-
beef
,
kinda
bland
,
but
nothing
yucky
in
it
.
Aaaannd
,
oh
yeah
,
crispy
duck
.
Very
crispy
,
as
in
dry
.
Not
so
great
.
The
kids
got
those
finger
trap
toys
with
their
fortune
cookies
.
The
waitress
was
cheerful
,
accomodating
and
informative
.
Extra
help
came
out
when
needed.I
think
some
of
the
best
Chinese
food
in
Madison
.
A
little
pricey
but
a
few
dishes
always
feeds
me
for
at
least
two
additional
meals.Imperial
Garden
has
been
around
a
long
time
and
seems
to
be
a
local
favorite
.
That
struck
me
as
a
very
bad
sign
when
I
came
to
Madison
almost
20
years
ago
,
and
that
continues
to
be
the
case
.
The
food
is
insipid
,
blandly
spiced
to
appeal
to
unadventurous
midwestern
tastes
and
with
a
menu
reminiscent
of
the
Americanized
Chinese
palaces
of
the
1950s
.
I
end
up
there
with
various
groups
on
occasion
,
but
try
to
keep
it
to
no
more
frequent
than
once
every
five
years
-LRB-
more
frequently
in
my
first
years
in
Madison
,
less
so
now
-RRB-
.
It
's
not
that
there
are
vastly
superior
authentic
Chinese
options
-LRB-
although
I
prefer
P.
F.
Chang
's
,
recognizing
its
limitations
-RRB-
,
but
one
does
better
with
other
Asian
options
when
in
Madison
--
particularly
Thai/Laotian
,
but
also
Indian
-LRB-
with
many
new
options
in
recent
years
-RRB-
.
It
's
perhaps
the
closest
you
can
get
to
authetic
Chinese
food
in
a
place
like
Madison
,
particularly
after
China
Palace
closed
.
The
food
is
alright
,
it
's
been
embellished
in
a
way
to
appeal
to
an
American
audience
,
but
at
least
the
some
of
the
menu
choices
are
pretty
real
.
My
real
problem
with
this
place
is
the
service
:
The
menu
was
misinforming
and
did
n't
specify
that
some
steamed
fish
dish
was
a
filet
as
opposed
to
a
whole
fish
.
I
politely
complained
to
the
waitress
about
my
order
not
being
accurate
and
she
informed
her
manager
.
The
manager
only
ended
up
refunding
me
50
%
off
the
item
ordered
and
began
telling
me
how
you
would
n't
refund
someone
a
fancy
steak
in
an
expensive
restaurant
!
In
the
end
,
I
paid
for
my
meal
and
tipped
the
poor
waitress
,
but
I
will
never
visit
this
place
again
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
that
manager
woman
was
giving
me
a
hard
time
because
I
was
a
young
college
student
or
what
,
but
her
management
skills
leave
much
to
be
desired.This
was
,
quite
possibly
,
the
WORST
Chinese
food
-LRB-
if
you
can
call
it
that
-RRB-
that
I
've
ever
eaten
in
my
life
.
We
started
with
the
appetizer
platter
for
two
.
The
calamari
was
so
stringy
that
I
had
to
swallow
it
in
one
bite
because
I
could
n't
separate
it
with
my
teeth
.
The
egg
rolls
were
at
least
crispy
and
well-rolled
,
but
they
had
absolutely
no
seasoning
other
than
a
tad
too
much
salt
.
The
shrimp
were
overcooked
,
the
barbecue
pork
was
dry
,
and
the
hot
dumplings
were
cold
and
under
seasoned
.
Then
came
the
entrees
.
I
ordered
Imperial
Chicken
,
thinking
that
being
the
restaurant
's
namesake
,
it
had
to
be
good
.
I
was
wrong
.
The
breading
was
mushy
,
the
chicken
was
dry
,
and
the
sauce
was
basically
sweet
and
sour
sauce
with
added
hoisan
,
and
several
dried
peppers
that
were
burnt
so
badly
they
added
an
unintentional
,
overdone
smoky
flavor
.
My
boyfriend
ordered
the
Ma-po
Tofu
.
He
loves
spicy
food
,
and
this
was
just
a
little
spicy
,
but
the
spice
overpowered
all
the
other
flavors
in
the
dish
-LRB-
besides
the
scallions
-RRB-
.
The
tofu
was
a
good
texture
,
but
the
unbalanced
sauce
flavors
basically
rendered
it
inedible
.
Apart
from
the
horrendous
food
was
the
tepid
service
.
I
had
to
ask
several
times
for
a
glass
of
water
.
The
waitress
came
by
with
the
water
pitcher
and
had
just
enough
to
fill
my
glass
up
halfway
,
so
she
returned
to
the
kitchen
for
a
refill
and
stopped
by
to
fill
my
boyfriend
's
glass
.
By
this
time
,
I
drank
my
half
glass
of
water
-
and
she
did
n't
even
bother
to
top
mine
off
.
I
tried
to
ask
for
some
,
but
she
walked
away
.
Plus
,
I
thought
it
was
supposed
to
be
an
authentic
Chinese
food
restaurant
-
what
's
with
the
Vivaldi
and
Mozart
soundtrack
?
Skip
this
place
all
together
and
hit
up
the
Asian
grocery
and
gas
station
next
door
.
On
Fridays
,
they
receive
shipments
of
Pork
Bao
in
from
a
bakery
in
Chicago
that
are
to
die
for!Probably
the
best
Chinese
in
Madison
these
days
.
Unfortunately
,
that
is
not
saying
much.Took
four
kids
tonight
and
we
were
all
underwhelmed
.
The
chicken
egg
drop
soup
was
oddly
sweet
.
We
got
a
barbecue
pork
dish
and
some
beef
dish
that
both
had
a
bland
gravy
.
A
huge
platter
of
pot
stickers
that
got
everyone
excited
but
ended
up
being
...
bland
.
Even
the
dipping
sauce
just
tasted
like
soy
sauce
.
The
calamari
was
not
tough
.
I
'll
give
them
that
.
If
this
is
the
best
Chinese
food
around
...
I
'm
sorry.Best
chinese
is
Madison
by
far
,
but
very
expensive
!
You
do
always
get
great
service
though
.
Yum!We
visit
family
in
Madison
at
least
twice
a
year
and
always
make
sure
to
have
dinner
here
.
The
shrimp
sizzling
rice
soup
is
absolutely
to
die
for
,
and
every
entree
I
've
had
has
been
fabulous
.
Hands
down
the
best
Chinese
food
I
have
ever
had.This
place
is
wonderful
.
One
,
Almost
anything
on
the
menu
can
be
made
gluten
free
.
Two
,
They
have
about
7
different
types
of
loose
teas
to
choose
from
.
Three
,
The
food
is
GREAT
!
My
favorite
dishes
are
the
Three
Delicacies
Sizzling
Rice
Soup
and
the
Tofu
Lettuce
Wraps
.
I
am
not
lying
when
I
say
that
I
have
NEVER
had
a
dish
I
did
n't
like
here
.
The
food
is
never
greasy
,
never
oversauced
and
never
overcooked
.
The
seafood
and
veggies
always
have
a
really
fresh
taste
...
I
seriously
have
no
complaints
at
all
.
I
miss
you.Just
an
update
to
say
they
do
n't
even
have
the
#
1
spot
anymore
as
that
goes
pretty
easily
to
Ichiban
on
park
.
Still
,
better
than
most
in
town.We
only
ever
go
for
their
lunch
special
-
so
that
's
what
this
review
is
,
I
have
n't
yet
gone
here
for
dinner
.
The
dishes
are
a
little
hit/miss
for
authenticity
.
The
Imperial
Chicken
is
really
good
-LRB-
not
breaded
like
someone
else
said
,
but
it
's
great
-RRB-
,
the
sweet
and
sour
chicken
is
definitely
a
``
miss
,
''
the
mu
shoo
pork
is
great
,
although
a
tad
greasy
,
the
fried
spring
rolls
are
fantastic
,
the
egg
rolls
are
okay
.
The
service
is
FANTASTIC
and
the
price
is
unbeatable
for
what
you
get
.
We
never
walk
away
from
lunch
hungry
.
I
suggest
getting
there
a
little
early
for
lunch
-LRB-
they
open
at
11am
-RRB-
because
it
can
get
a
little
crowded
.
Also
,
I
love
their
spicy
mustard
-
you
have
to
try
it
!!!
Fool
me
once
,
shame
on
you
.
Fool
me
twice
,
shame
on
me
.
I
went
there
a
second
time
because
I
could
n't
remember
if
I
liked
the
food
or
not
-LRB-
yes
,
it
was
THAT
unremarkable
-RRB-
.
Upon
going
there
the
second
time
,
I
knew
there
would
not
be
a
third
.
Ever
.
I
know
this
is
Madison
,
but
c'mon
,
I
've
had
more
authentic
Chinese
food
at
Panda
Express
.
What
should
have
been
an
immediate
tip-off
was
the
fact
that
there
were
n't
any
chinese
words
on
the
menu
...
and
that
all
the
clientele
was
white
-LRB-
again
,
yes
I
know
this
is
Madison
,
but
this
is
compared
to
other
Chinese
restaurants
like
Fugu
or
Ichiban
-RRB-
.
I
do
n't
actually
remember
the
specific
dishes
I
ordered
-LRB-
I
've
had
fish
,
chicken
,
pork
,
and
beef
there
-RRB-
,
but
it
all
just
tasted
as
if
it
had
been
sitting
in
the
freezer
for
months
.
Dry
and
flavorless
.
The
service
was
also
slow
.
They
refilled
our
glasses
only
once
,
after
we
had
asked
for
the
check
.
I
wo
n't
be
going
back.It
is
not
delicious
,
but
the
service
is
good.Often
rumored
to
have
the
best
Chinese
food
in
the
Madison
area
,
this
restaurant
is
a
major
disappointment
.
My
spicy
tofu
and
vegetables
dish
was
not
in
the
least
spicy
and
the
tofu
was
only
fried
and
would
have
been
better
marinated
.
The
entree
my
dining
companion
ordered
was
also
sub-par
.
The
service
was
very
quick
and
the
food
served
very
quickly
,
maybe
too
much
so
.
Madison
has
great
Southast
Asian
restaurants
,
but
I
definitely
wo
n't
be
eating
more
Chinese
food
anywhere
here.Grilled
potstickers
,
moo
shu
pork
,
cashew
chicken
.
Yum
!!
Yum
!
Party
of
7
,
everyone
ordered
their
own
dish
and
then
shared
with
all
.
Started
with
pot
stickers
and
shrimp
ragoon
.
Grilled
pot
stickers
were
really
good
,
could
have
just
eaten
those
and
been
happy
.
Appetizers
came
with
a
variety
of
dipping
sauces
.
Best
dishes
sampled
were
crispy
orange
beef
,
almond
chicken
and
generals
lamb
.
Lamb
was
way
tender
,
excellent
choice
.
Service
was
prompt
and
friendly
,
great
atmosphere
.
Ended
meal
with
delicious
mango
ice
cream
.
Left
happy
and
very
full!I
live
on
the
east
side
of
Madison
and
I
always
eat
at
the
Imperial
Gardens
near
E.
Washington
and
this
Imperial
was
a
let
down
.
The
restaurant
itself
is
beautiful
and
the
decor
is
lovely
but
the
food
and
staff
was
n't
as
amazing
as
I
hoped
for
.
For
starters
,
the
food
is
so
expensive
compared
to
the
east
side
and
the
plates
are
larger
but
the
portions
are
definitely
not
bigger
.
Our
chicken
sizzling
rice
soup
was
flavor
less
and
completely
watered
down
.
My
friend
loves
oyster
beef
but
what
received
tasted
completely
different
and
it
had
a
weird
sort
of
sour
after
taste
.
I
had
the
pepper
steak
and
I
did
like
how
the
onions
and
peppers
are
more
thinly
sliced
but
my
meat
also
had
a
strange
after
taste
.
The
staff
was
very
kind
but
a
little
annoying
.
It
's
was
great
at
first
to
see
how
attentive
they
were
to
our
needs
but
the
waitress
came
to
us
almost
every
10min
and
made
awkward
small
talk
which
really
bothered
us
.
We
could
then
see
her
staring
at
us
from
across
the
room
waiting
to
start
another
unwanted
conversation
.
Imperial
Garden
Middleton
will
definitely
be
memorable
but
,
for
all
the
wrong
reasons.Decent
food
,
slightly
more
expensive
than
their
competitors
,
and
more
legit
varieties
on
their
menu
.
I
'll
give
credit
to
Imperial
Garden
's
decor
as
it
is
significantly
more
eye-pleasing
than
other
Asian
restaurants
and
the
fact
that
they
have
a
full
bar
.
I
give
kudos
to
this
place
because
they
're
the
only
Chinese
restaurant
in
the
area
that
offers
peking
duck
,
a
true
Chinese
specialty
.
Their
seafood
selection
is
also
pretty
upstanding
and
are
cooked
well
.
I
'm
also
a
fan
of
their
``
banquet
''
specials
,
which
is
for
when
you
go
in
groups
and
they
offer
you
a
selection
of
X
many
dishes
to
share
for
a
set
price
per
person
-LRB-
this
is
available
for
lunch
and
dinner
I
believe
,
though
I
've
never
been
here
for
lunch
-RRB-
.
Aside
from
the
aforementioned
pros
of
Imperial
Garden
,
the
other
dishes
on
their
menu
-LRB-
if
you
order
without
doing
the
``
banquet
''
-RRB-
is
average-tasting
at
best
and
overpriced.Im
rating
this
more
on
being
American
Chinese
then
true
authentic
Chinese
.
That
being
said
it
was
very
nice
inside
.
Not
too
formal
but
definitely
not
a
take-out
joint
.
We
got
a
cup
of
the
Hot
and
Sour
soup
.
Which
is
always
my
favorite
.
To
try
something
different
we
got
the
Seafood
Hot
and
Sour
soup
also
.
Almost
taste
just
like
the
regular
Hot
and
Sour
put
of
course
more
of
a
seafood
flavor
then
pork
.
It
only
comes
in
a
serving
that
serves
2-3
.
Which
is
a
great
value
because
the
3
of
us
easily
got
2
cups
each
out
of
it
.
The
Fragrant
Pork
had
chestnuts
,
green
peppers
,
onions
,
mushrooms
and
carrots
in
a
garlic
tomato
sauce
,
Said
that
it
was
spicy
hot
put
I
only
got
a
tiny
bit
of
kick
.
Put
still
good
being
sweet
and
garlicky
.
The
Three
Delicacies
Sizzling
Rice
dish
caught
me
by
surprise
in
a
good
way
.
Expecting
it
would
come
with
that
same
bland
and
over
salty
white
sauce
.
But
I
could
n't
stop
tasting
the
sauce
.
It
was
like
no
other
white
sauce
I
have
tasted
before
.
The
waitress
poured
the
sauce
for
the
dish
right
in
front
of
you
so
it
was
``
sizzling
''
.
The
rice
was
on
the
bottom
of
the
skillet
plate
so
it
ended
up
getting
crunchy
.
Adding
a
great
texture
to
the
dish
.
The
shrimp
,
scallops
and
chicken
in
the
dish
were
tender
.
Also
in
it
were
pea
pods
,
water
chestnuts
,
carrots
and
mushrooms
.
Even
the
fortune
cookie
at
the
end
was
a
better
grade
cookie
then
take-out
places
.
Service
was
helpful
,
attentive
and
friendly.For
Wisconsin
,
this
is
about
the
best
you
are
going
to
get
for
Chinese
Food
.
Sorry
,
you
live
in
Wisconsin
.
But
the
food
is
very
good
.
Huge
servings
,
enormous
shrimps
,
chicken
that
is
tender
,
fresh
rice
.
Do
n't
complain
Cheeseheads
,
this
is
good
as
it
gets
for
Chinese
in
Wisconsin.Yum
.
Check

Just
to

up

How
do
you
get
voted
best
of
for
31
years
when
what
is
served
is
awful
?
This
is
the
worst
Chinese
food
my
entire
family
has
had
in
years
.
We
all
ordered
different
things
and
none
of
us
could
eat
our
meals
.
That
was
$
50
wasted
.
There
was
no
flavor
,
or
the
flavor
there
was
did
not
match
the
dish
.
How
do
you
mess
up
beef
fried
rice
?
I
can
make
it
with
more
flavor
.
The
Mongolian
beef
had
a
flavor
but
it
was
all
wrong
.
If
you
want
to
waste
money
and
still
be
hungry
,
this
is
the
place
for
you
.
How
do
places
keep
getting
good
reviews
when
they
are
so
bad
.
I
use
to
trust
Yelp
reviews
but
lately
,
I
've
been
fooled
by
the
reviews.I
had
fond
memories
of
dining
at
the
Imperial
Garden
...
back
in
the
1990s
,
when
I
did
n't
really
have
access
to
more
``
exotic
''
and
interesting
foods
.
I
've
been
to
this
location
twice
within
the
past
year
or
so
-
once
for
lunch
with
a
coworker
,
and
once
for
dinner
with
friends
last
night
.
+
Huge
establishment
-
impressively
big
+
Quick
to
be
seated
+
Server
was
friendly

Waters
were
refilled

Decent
selection
of
bottled
beers/drinks
-
Massive
menu
,
but
not
really
...
many
identical
dishes
on
the
menu
,
with
different
protein
options
-
Food/dishes
very
salty
,
but
otherwise
bland
in
flavor
.
No
spice
,
no
interesting

-
Sea
bass

extremely
fishy
;
sea

be
``

''
and
non-fishy

-
Service
became
extremely
slow/absent
after
we
received
our
entrees
.
Took
us
30
+
minutes
to
get
checks
,
pay
,
and
leave
-
entrees
arrived
at
7:15
pm
,
we
left
at
8:15
pm
.
I
'm
glad
the
four
of
us
split
entrees
last
night
...
I
would
've
been
really
disappointed
had
I
ordered
something
for
myself
.
It
's
just
...
not
very
good
.
Guessing
this
place
caters
to
folks
who
want
to
eat
adventurously
without
really
doing
so
.
The
food
is
sub-par
;
this
place
is
resting
on
some
large
laurels
.
I
'd
much
prefer
a
flavorful
Thai
or
Indian
dish
.
Wo
n't
be
back.Best
Chinese
food
in
the
area
.
Great
service
and
calming
atmosphere.What
a
crushing
experience
.
My
son
was
in
town
and
when
he
is
here
we
like
to
visit
and
spoil
ourselves
to
a
splurge
of
a
dinner
outing
.
This
particular
night
was
at
the
end
of
summer
and
there
was
an
amazing
thunderstorm
about
to
occur
.
SO
on
this
stormy
night
we
decided
on
Chinese
and
I
had
recommended
we
drive
to
Middleton
for
what
I
had
heard
to
be
the
best
around
.
Ok
.
.
so
after
a
short
15
min
drive
we
had
a
great
parking
spot
...
ran
inside
and
were
greeted
with
a
warming
beautiful
atmosphere
.
.
very
welcoming
large
foyer
,
nice
bar
area
which
u
walk
thru
to
get
to
your
dining
area
.
After
the
immediate
seating
,
WE
were
greeted
by
a
pleasant
asian
woman
and
ordered
drinks
.
which
turned
out
to
be
just
right
.
Appetizers
were
mediocre
...
nothing
to
remember
...
we
had
the
app
for
two
...
calamari
was
HORRIBLE
btw
I
could
go
into
so
much
detail
but
who
is
gon
na
read
all
that
...
the
following
is
my
reason
for
writing
...
My
forewarning
is
NOT
TO
TRUST
in
ordering
the
Lobster
dish
.
I
wanted
a
decadent
treat
for
myself
and
decided
on
the
-LRB-
market
price
-RRB-
45
$
Lobster
dinner
entree
which
came
with
two
choices
of
preparation
.
Ginger
sauce
or
garlic
butter
i
ordered
the
garlic
but
the
server
said
no
the
other
was
best
.
More
importantly
i
asked
her
how
large
the
lobster
was
and
if
it
was
sold
by
pound
cause
it
was
listed
as
Market
Price
.
She
said
she
would
inquire
before
i
ordered
and
returned
to
our
table
and
said
it
was
2.5
pds
or
larger
.
So
that
made
me
excited
and
i
did
not
hesitate
in
my
ordering
.
I
thought
45
dollars
was
a
great
price
for
a
generous
2.5
pd
lobster
entree
.
What
arrived
on
my
plate
was
a
cut
up
overly
sauced
jigsawed
puzzled
lobster
animation
on
a
platter
which
was
in
no
way
a
2.5
pound
creature
to
begin
with
.
It
was
dismantled
then
pieced
together
to
look
like
a
lobster
shape
.
The
meat
was
still
in
shell
.
-LRB-
and
I
mean
IN
SHELL
-RRB-
.
There
was
hardly
any
meat
to
be
had
.
The
tail
which
should
have
been
the
meatiest
portion
was
cut
in
one
inch
pieces
with
shell
INTACT
and
had
yielded
maybe
2
morsel
of
meat
total
.
I
was
shocked
as
i
struggled
to
manipulate
any
source
of
goodness
from
the
pieces
of
crustacean.There
was
literally
no
lobster
and
what
was
there
was
swimming
in
overpowering
sticky
sauce
.
All
in
all
an
EXTREME
disappointment
.
Not
what
I
was
expecting
in
the
LEAST
!!
As
the
storm
gained
intensity
outdoors
,
my
high
hopes
and
any
thoughts
of
returning
to
this
eatery
were
un-intensified
.
I
will
NEVER
return
.
I
can
not
tolerate
being
misled
by
a
server
We
ended
up
tipping
and
not
making
a
fuss
...
just
another
lesson
learned
.
The
storm
raged
on
,
I
did
get
to
spend
time
with
my
son
and
hopefully
educate
you
.
.
Not
a
total
loss
I
guess.Just
stay
away
from
places
like
this
that
lie
for
profit
and
have
followings
that
end
up
being
ill
fated.Always
consistently
delicious
!
Classic
preparations
of
Americanized
Chinese
.
The
cashew
chicken
is
great!I
was
in
town
visiting
family
and
someone
suggested
IG
.
When
I
drove
up
to
it
,
it
brought
back
yummy
memories
.
It
's
been
years
since
I
ate
there
.
I
am
glad
we
went
there
for
dinner
.
We
ate
governors
chicken
,
governors
beef
,
sweet
and
sour
chicken
,
peppered
beef
and
beef
chow
fun
.
Everyone
ate
their
plates
!
Service
was
slow
that
night
but
the
food
made
up
for
it!There
's
a
climactic
scene
in
the
movie
Drive
where
the
hero
meets
the
badguy
in
a
`
Chinese
'
restaurant
.
It
's
a
prop
for
the
movie
to
sell
the
idea
of
foreign
while
these
two
real
bad
American
dudes
hash
out
their
differences
.
It
's
rich
and
exotic
and
mysterious
and
...
goddamn
exciting
.
IG
is
a
Chinese
American
restaurant
in
the
burbs
of
burbs
that
serves
burbanites
,
but
man
it
had
that
feeling
.
The
Russian
friend
and
I
went
there
on
a
Sunday
night
for
their
Peking
Duck
special
.
We
got
that
and
some
appetizer
platter
and
some
wonton
soup
and
some
cocktails
.
None
of
it
was
particularly
memorable
,
and
in
fact
the
Peking
Duck
skin
was
*
not
*
crispy
,
but
the
presentation
was
spot
on
.
There
's
been
so
much
streamlining
of
Asian
restaurants
that
nice
chairs
and
big
booths
with
lots
of
room
is
uncommon
.
And
on
top
of
it
I
am
a
sucker
for
ethnic
restaurants
that
have
good
servers
that
can
connect
with
customers
.
Do
you
know
how
rare
that
is
?
Take
advantage
and
talk
it
out
.
Be
polite
and
get
good
service
.
I
do
n't
think
Madison
's
foodies
would
give
this
place
four
stars
.
But
I
saw
a
bunch
of
other
slant
eyes
here
with
me
,
and
I
imagined
they
were
like
me
,
wide
eyed
and
happy
to
be
here
eating
whatever
this
was
.
I
'd
take
my
mom
here.Hands
down
the
best
Chinese
food
in
Madison
.
The
chicken
chow
mein
has
been
a
favorite
since
I
was
a
child
.
Try
the
egg
rolls
and
the
jasmine
or
chrysanthemum
tea
.
You
really
can
never
go
wrong
here
!
The
decor
is
beautiful
,
and
makes
you
almost
feel
like
you
could
be
in
a
restaurant
in
China.Imperial
Garden
has
been
getting
progressively
worse
over
the
last
few
years
.
The
waitstaff
has
always
been
attentive
and
professional
,
and
the
wait
time
for
food
is
reasonably
short
.
The
restaurant
itself
and
the
bathrooms
are
clean
and
spacious
.
The
ambiance
is
relaxed
and
pleasant
,
and
noise
levels
are
comfortably
low
.
But
none
of
these
things
can
save
the
mediocre-to-bad
food
.
That
is
,
if
you
get
your
food
at
all
.
On
more
than
one
occasion
,
they
have
forgotten
to
include
entire
entrees
or
side
dishes
when
I
've
picked
up
take-out
.
I
now
double-check
all
of
my
orders
before
leaving
.
The
egg
rolls
taste
like
they
came
out
of
a
box
in
the
freezer
.
They
are
greasy
and
heavy
,
with
very
little
flavor
until
you
douse
them
in
sweet-and-sour
sauce
that
's
so
sweet
it
might
as
well
be
syrup
.
The
same
problems
plague
the
entirely
unremarkable
crab
rangoon
.
I
've
had
the
hot
and
sour
soup
,
and
disliked
the
taste
quite
a
bit
.
Not
spicy
enough
,
and
far
too
sour
.
I
usually
order
the
ginger
beef
stir-fry
.
There
's
hardly
any
ginger
flavor
,
and
the
sauce
is
thick
and
also
fairly
sweet
.
If
they
halved
the
amount
of
sugar
in
everything
,
it
would
be
a
good
start
.
I
've
had
more
success
with
the
sizzling
black
pepper
beef
,
which
has
a
punch
of
black
pepper
and
a
good
balance
of
meat
and
vegetables
.
On
a
recent
trip
,
a
friend
got
the
beef
lo
mein
.
It
had
a
nice
quantity
of
beef
,
but
an
anemic
quantity
of
vegetables
.
It
was
also
very
greasy
and
watery
,
and
tasted
extremely
bland
.
The
only
reason
I
go
here
as
often
as
I
do
is
that
my
grandmother
-LRB-
the
poster
child
for
stereotypical
Wisconsin
taste
buds
,
bless
her
heart
-RRB-
loves
the
three
delicacies
sizzling
rice
.
I
did
discover
one
saving
grace
:
if
you
dump
sriracha
on
the
food
,
it
blends
very
well
with
the
food
and
elevates
all
of
the
flavors
.
Too
bad
they
do
n't
have
any
of
it
at
the
restaurant
,
it
could
save
many
a
dish
.
Bottom
line
:
there
's
much
better
,
more
authentic
,
more
balanced
,
and
less
heavy
Chinese
food
available
in
Madison
at
comparable
prices
.
If
you
're
looking
for
good
Chinese
in
town
,
check
out
Hong
Kong
Cafe
on
Regent
or
Orient
House
on
South
Park
instead.The
short
of
the
story
is
-
we
went
here
yesterday
-LRB-
Mother
's
Day
-RRB-
and
were
there
3
hours
!
Waited
a
full
2
hours
for
our
food
.
So
if
you
have
do
n't
mind
waiting
an
unbelievable
amount
of
time
for
food
and
have
all
day
to
waste
,
then
read
on
...
For
years
I
have
drove
by
the
Imperial
Garden
and
referred
to
it
as
the
``
Chinese
Restaurant
Gas
Station
''
.
I
do
n't
even
know
if
they
are
connected
or
what
,
but
you
see
them
both
as
you
turn
the
corner
.
We
decided
to
go
to
this
place
for
Mother
's
Day
and
check
it
out
.
Talking
to
friends
over
the
weekend
,
we
were
told
it
was
pretty
good
.
The
building
is
nice
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
restaurant
was
way
nicer
than
I
expected
.
Very
large
and
nicely
decorated
.
Not
so
cheesy
like
a
lot
of
Chinese-American
places
in
Wisconsin
.
The
hostess
greeted
us
very
nicely
and
having
reservations
we
were
seated
right
away
.
Now
-
we
were
a
larger
than
average
group
-
table
of
8
-
but
they
clearly
were
set
up
for
groups
this
big
as
they
had
large
tables
in
the
corner
of
the
rooms
with
a
spinning
lazy
susan
in
the
middle
that
was
perfect
for
us
.
I
think
we
probably
could
have
even
gotten
9
or
10
people
on
this
table
.
The
waitress
was
very
nice
too
.
Came
right
away
and
got
us
drinks
and
very
friendly
.
This
is
when
things
went
down
hill
.
We
did
order
appetizers
,
which
came
out
right
away
.
Pot
Stickers
-
both
steamed
and
fried
-
which
were
pretty
good
.
Once
our
whole
group
arrived
we
all
ordered
regular
items
from
their
menu
.
Then
we
waited
.
Waited
and
waited
and
waited
.
Apparently
so
did
everyone
around
us
.
For
hours
-
over
two
to
be
exact
.
The
waitress
did
her
best
-
kept
coming
by
and
telling
us
she
was
sorry
,
that
the
Kitchen
was
crazy
and
that
we
were
next
.
Honestly
we
should
have
left
-
but
it
was
hard
enough
getting
family
members
from
4
households
together
at
one
time
.
Eventually
the
food
came
out
.
To
their
credit
,
I
thought
everything
tasted
pretty
good
.
I
got
two
different
shrimp
dishes
.
Decent
flavor
,
cooked
perfectly
-
the
snap
peas
and
water
chestnuts
were
good
.
Portion
was
decent
on
the
Shrimp
dinner
and
much
larger
on
the
chicken
dinners
that
others
in
my
group
got
.
I
agree
with
other
reviews
-
its
not
the
most
adventurous
food
.
Flavors
were
safe
and
my
spicy
shrimp
was
n't
very
spicy
at
all
.
My
sister-in-law
was
upset
her
Sesame
Chicken
with
Broccoli
came
with
one
piece
of
broccoli
.
She
complained
and
the
waitress
brought
out
a
side
of
broccoli
.
Overall
,
If
the
food
was
n't
pretty
good
-
I
would
have
given
this
place
one
star
.
I
give
our
waitress
credit
for
holding
it
together
too
.
She
offered
free
desert
but
we
were
about
an
hour
late
for
getting
to
another
place
so
had
to
go
.
Saddest
thing
is
we
heard
that
this
has
been
an
ongoing
problem
with
the
Kitchen
.
Sounds
like
they
do
n't
fire
dishes
in
the
order
they
come
in
and
they
have
a
lot
of
trouble
keeping
up
with
things
.
If
they
could
correct
this
problem
and
add
a
bit
more
flavor
into
a
few
dishes
,
the
place
really
could
be
ok
.
Try
it
on
your
own
risk
-
but
I
would
plan
on
spending
several
long
hours
while
you
wait
for
your
food.Absolutely
THE
worst
!
This
place
won
``
Best
of
Madison
''
for
Chinese
food
for
how
many
years
???
The
judge
must
have
been
completely
stoned
out
of
his
mind
!
Customer
service
:
Very
poor
.
The
server
never
checked
back
until
I
went
looking
for
her
,
wondering
where
our
order
was
50
minutes
after
ordering
.
Food
finally
arrived
for
our
group
of
four
--
STONE
COLD
!
Plates
themselves
were
hot
but
practically
frostbite
on
the
food
.
Could
n't
eat
it
.
Manager
came
by
,
apologized
and
took
50
%
off
the
bill
-LRB-
!!!
-RRB-
.
Should
have
been
100
%
comped
.
I
'm
one
of
those
folks
who
normally
overlooks
a
lot
and
actually
hates
to
complain
,
but
this
culinary
travesty
really
needed
to
be
reported
.
If
this
place
previously
had
great
food
and
service
,
then
as
of
2014
they
've
completely
lost
their
``
mojo
''
.
This
is
our
go-to
Chinese
restaurant
in
the
Madison
area
.
Hands
down
,
it
's
the
best
Chinese
I
've
found
so
far
.
I
'd
give
it
5
stars
if
the
prices
were
more
reasonable
and
the
dine-in
environment
was
better
.
Like
I
said
,
the
food
is
superb
.
My
usual
dish
is
Cashew
Chicken
.
It
's
hard
to
deviate
from
that
when
it
's
sooooo
good
.
Other
dishes
are
excellent
as
well
.
What
I
like
about
Imperial
is
that
the
meat
quality
is
good
.
The
beef
is
tasty
and
tender
-
not
tough
or
``
questionable
''
.
The
chicken
is
good
as
well
-
not
some
of
the
gray
chicken-like
material
found
at
lesser
establishments
.
We
do
n't
dine
in
often
or
at
all
.
It
's
a
little
more
formal
than
I
prefer
,
and
the
experience
can
take
a
while
.
Just
not
my
preference
.
I
keep
their
number
in
my
phone
and
call
ahead
for
carry-out
.
That
's
the
way
to
go
here
,
imho
.
Their
location
is
very
convenient
for
those
of
us
that
work
in
town
and
live
in
the
western
`
burbs
.
The
portions
they
give
out
are
very
fair
-
my
cashew
chicken
typically
leaves
me
with
a
nice
lunch
for
work
the
next
day
.
If
you
're
looking
for
top-quality
Chinese
food
,
I
highly
recommend
getting
take-out
here
.
If
you
do
n't
mind
a
more
formal
setting
and
have
the
time
,
go
ahead
and
dine
in.Great
Margaritas
.
But
it
's
hard
to
review
a
mexican
restaurant
that
's
as
good
as
the
next
.
I
still
wish
there
was
a
TRULY
good
mexican
restaurant
in
Madison
...
Still
waiting
.
And
do
n't
come
tell
me
...
um
...
the
one
on
Park
.
.
what
's
that
name
???
...
La
Hacienda
.
I
'd
rather
poke
my
eye
out
or
eat
at
La
Bambas
...
Ok
Mexican
like
everywhere
else
.
I
completely
agree
with
the
previous
reviewer
,
``
when
is
the
authentic
one
coming
to
this
town
?
''
The
menu
cover
page
says
it
's
authentic
,
but
the
men
items
themselves
looked
little
more
tex-mex
ish
.
I
had
a
fajita
plate
while
my
friend
had
a
chicken
dish
-LRB-
I
forgot
what
it
was
called
-RRB-
.
My
fajita
arrived
on
a
sizzling
hot
plate
-LRB-
that
's
takes
care
of
the
``
fun
part
''
regardless
of
the
quality
-RRB-
,
and
it
was
pretty
good
.
The
portion
was
huge
,
so
I
had
to
take
ha
;
f
of
my
plate
to
go
,
and
the
take
out
became
the
perfect
left-over
dinner
next
day.Mi
Cocina
is
my
favorite
Mexican-style
restaurant
in
the
Madison
area
.
I
have
never
come
away
unimpressed
with
either
the
food
or
the
service
.
I
ca
n't
really
speak
to
authenticity
since
I
would
n't
really
know
it
if
I
saw
it
,
but
for
what
they
do
Mi
Cocina
does
it
well
.
All
I
do
know
is
that
I
have
gotten
my
favorites
here
over
and
over
without
ever
having
any
problems
.
The
staff
is
always
friendly
and
fast
which
sets
the
place
apart
from
several
other
area
restaurants
of
the
genre
.
If
only
for
consistency
I
would
rate
Mi
Cocina
a
three
,
and
with
never
having
a
bad
meal
I
definitely
would
go
with
a
high
3.5
-
4
stars
.
Last
time
I
had
the
fried
tilapia
tacos
,
and
I
especially
enjoyed
the
spicy
cream-based
sauce
that
was
served
on
the
side
.
It
was
perfectly
seasoned
for
my
taste
,
though
it
was
a
bit
hot
for
my
mother
.
The
tilapia
was
lightly
fried
and
was
still
tender
.
The
accompanying
refried
beans
were
decent
,
and
served
to
allow
for
the
spice
from
the
tacos
to
dissipate
.
I
still
put
the
blackened
tilapia
tacos
at
Tex
Tubbs
at
the
top
of
my
favorites
list
,
but
these
easily
jumped
to
the
#
2
position
.
On
previous
trips
I
've
gotten
flautas
,
which
were
perfectly
fried
and
not
too
crispy
,
and
the
enchiladas
sonora
,
which
comes
with
an
excellent
spinach
and
a
creamy
sauce
.
I
also
really
enjoy
the
cheese
and
mushroom
quesidilla
and
the
fajitas
.
My
sister
,
who
is
lactose-intolerant
,
had
found
the
menu
a
bit
dairy-laden
,
but
she
did
end
up
finding
a
chicken
breast
entree
that
is
now
her
favorite
.
The
prices
are
quite
reasonable
and
given
the
amount
of
food
always
a
good
deal
.
Mi
Cocina
probably
wo
n't
ever
be
held
up
as
a
paragon
of
the
style
,
but
it
has
always
been
reliable
and
enjoyable
and
for
that
I
'll
keep
coming
back.The
food
is
decent
,
the
service
is
better
than
your
average
Madison
restaurant
and
the
bathrooms
were
clean
.
It
is
a
bit
out
of
our
way
but
it
is
consistent
enough
to
warrant
more
visits.Good
food
-
especially
if
you
're
in
a
hurry
.
The
service
is
excellent
.
If
you
're
in
Brookfield
try
the
Mi
Cocina
on
Bluemound
-
I
believe
owned
by
the
same
people
but
the
food
is
bette.rAfter
a
wonderful
day
spent
sitting
down
at
the
Memorial
Union
,
drinking
beer
and
reading
through
the
Sunday
newspaper
,
hunger
got
the
better
part
of
us
,
and
Mexican
food
sounded
yummy
.
So
,
our
small
group
made
our
way
back
toward
the
Middleton
and
decided
to
take
a
short
walk
over
to
Mi
Cocina
.
We
arrived
at
around
6:00
pm
on
a
Sunday
and
were
promptly
seated
.
The
waiter
brought
us
chips
and
salsa
immediately
,
and
then
took
our
drink
orders
.
Within
a
few
minutes
,
our
sodas
arrived
,
along
with
a
cheese
dip
.
We
quickly
scarfed
down
the
salsa
and
cheese
dip
;
the
salsa
was
initially
mild
but
then
had
a
nice
little
kick
to
it
at
the
end
.
The
chips
were
a
thicker
cut
chip
;
they
were
n't
the
slightest
bit
greasy
.
The
queso
was
excellent
-
nice
and
hearty
,
white
cheese
,
delicious
.
We
ordered
our
entrees
and
within
minutes
our
food
was
available
.
There
was
a
slight
mix-up
with
my
order
-
I
had
requested
chicken
burritos
but
received
beef
.
No
big
deal
;
the
beef
burritos
were
decent
-
some
chunks
of
potato
were
an
interesting
touch
.
My
dining
partner
ordered
a
sampler
plate
,
which
came
with
a
chicken
burrito
,
a
chicken
enchilada
,
and
a
tamale
.
It
was
good
as
well
;
the
chicken
was
far
better
than
the
ground
beef
.
Service
was
beyond
excellent
-
very
fast
,
very
attentive
,
and
as
such
,
we
left
a
nice
tip
.
Only
complaints
?
A
tad
pricey
-
our
meal
was
$
26
without
any
beers/margaritas
,
and
there
were
a
ton
of
kids
in
there
,
which
was
a
bit
distracting
.
All
in
all
a
decent
experience.It
started
out
as
an
excellent
place
to
go
then
they
changed
the
menu
,
then
they
changed
the
menu
again
!
The
food
changed
names
and
the
pricing
increased
but
essentially
it
remained
the
same
.
They
are
now
at
the
point
where
they
are
charging
a
little
much
for
the
food
they
are
serving
.
I
still
go
here
because
of
convenience
and
lightning
fast
service
.
I
noticed
a
new
manager
walking
over
the
servers
shoulders
seemed
to
make
the
staff
feeling
like
they
were
on
pins
and
needles
.
Kids

keep
that
in
mind!Kids

I
wo
n't
be
heading
back
.
Go
to
Los
Gemelos
off
of
State
St
instead.I
love
their
taco
loco
.
It
's
a
mouthwatering
fajita/taco
salad
concoction
that
I
a.
ca
n't
get
enough
of
and
b.
ca
n't
finish
.
I
have
tried
a
few
other
dishes
and
nothing
ranks
near
the
crazy
taco
.
Warm
,
thick
chips
and
a
mild
salsa
are
served
bountifully
.
The
chips
are
n't
greasy
and
are
not
heavily
salted
which
makes
me
happy
.
I
like
to
add
my
own
anyway
.
They
have
three
versions
of
guacamole
.
Yesterday
we
tried
the
most
basic
which
was
delicious
and
simple
.
We
also
tried
an
appetizer
with
cheese
and
chorizo
.
It
was
good
,
but
quickly
coagulated
which
resulted
in
an
undip-able
dip
.
MARGARITA
ALERT
-
their
house
margarita
...
not
a
traditional
margarita
.
In
my
opinion
,
it
tasted
like
watered
down
orange
soda
.
And
the
color
is
a
light
peach
color
.
If
you
want
a
classic
,
lime
margarita
I
have
yet
to
find
one
I
love
here
.
I
'm
not
your
typical
margarita
drinker
.
The
aftermath
of
too
much
sweet
margarita
mix
and
I
do
not
get
along
.
I
admit
,
I
'm
kind
of
picky
about
margaritas
,
but
these
,
these
should
have
a
warning
when
ordering.Good
authentic
Mexican
,
a
lot
of
menu
options
,
great
service
,
nice
quite
atmosphere.I
really
enjoyed
my
dinner
here
.
I
had
a
fantastic
fajita
platter
,
which
included
beef
,
chicken
,
shrimp
,
and
the
requisite
peppers
and
onions
,
but
also
whole
scallions
and
tomato
wedges
.
Delicious
!
The
guacamole
was
decent
,
though
a
little
bland
.
And
my
husband
's
mole
sauce
was
just
OK
.
But
I
really
liked
the
spicy
salsa
they
brought
to
the
table
when
I
requested
it
.
The
service
was
pretty
great
;
there
was
a
whole
team
of
servers
that
were
constantly
checking
up
on
us
to
make
sure
we
were
doing
OK
.
Every
time
we
had
a
special
request
-LRB-
see
:
the
spicy
salsa
-RRB-
,
they
were
right
on
top
of
it
.
But
what
I
REALLY
liked
was
the
margaritas
;
our
table
had
a
pitcher
of
blended
strawberry
margaritas
,
and
they
were
absolutely
perfect
.
Blended
just
right
with
no
big
chunks
of
ice
;
perfectly
balanced
strawberry
and
tequila
flavor
.
I
could
have
consumed
that
whole
pitcher
by
myself
without
even
putting
in
too
much
effort
.
Yum!So
,
I
've
enjoyed
Mi
Cocina
before
...
but
I
think
my
tastes
have
matured
.
The
salsa
was
good
,
but
the
sauce
inside
of
my
taco
and
chimichanga
was
a
strange
ketchup/bbq
tasting
mixture
.
Beans
were
ok
,
rice
,
not
so
much
.
I
probably
wo
n't
be
back
.
Sorry
Mi
Cocina.I
joined
a
few
coworkers
for
lunch
here
today
...
I
've
not
been
a
huge
fan
of
Mi
Cocina
,
so
I
hoped
the
new
location
and
fresh
look
would
've
improved
the
experience
.
It
's
still
just
barely
passable
as
Mexican
food
.
Most
entrees
appear
to
be
drowning
in
sauces
,
cheese
,
and
other
gooey/greasy
stuff
.
The
salsas
are
extremely
watery
and
lacking
in
flavor
.
The
guacamole
-LRB-
not
the
tableside-made
-RRB-
is
bland
and
pasty
.
I
ordered
a
pollo
ensalada
-LRB-
chicken
salad
-RRB-
,
which
arrived
as
a
bowl
of
super
watery
iceburg
lettuce
,
a
slab
of
seared
chicken
breast
,
4
small
slices
of
cucumber
,
a
spoonful
of
pico
de
gallo
,
and
a
huge
glob
of
guacamole
-LRB-
which
I
scraped
off
and
set
aside
-RRB-
.
The
salad
was
ok
,
but
as
I
neared
the
end
,
I
literally
had
what
looked
like
a
small
soup
bowl
's
worth
of
water
resting
in
the
bottom
.
My
coworker
's
entrees
were
drenched
in
various
cheese
sauces/red
sauces
;
the
taco
combo
was
blanketed
in
cheese
.
They
loved
it
,
but
my
guts
would
've
been
complaining
for
days
...
So
,
enjoy
the
new
location
and
ambiance
-
just
do
n't
expect
better
food
.
Those
who
've
had
real
Mexican
food
will
not
enjoy
this
place

is
my
favorite
Mexican
restaurant
in
Madison
-
and
I
think
it
is
the
best
one
in
town
.
Here
's
what
I
like
:
The
House
Guacamole
-
Heaven
!
I
always
order
this
,
and
the
last
time
,
we
had
a
table
side
preparation
,
a
clear
demonstration
on
how
fresh
the
food
is
here
-
another
thing
that
I
love
about
this
place
-
the
abundance
of
fresh
food
.
In
all
its
simplicity
,
it
's
perfect
.
The
salsa
-
I
've
disappointed
all
over
Madison
with
other
Mexican
restaurant
's
salsa
,
and
even
for
that
matter
,
all
over
the
Midwest
and
parts
of
California
.
I
've
had
the
best
salsa
here
-
again
very
simple
,
but
very
delicious
-
and
is
n't
that
what
matters
?
Food
should
be
delicious
,
especially
food
at
any
restaurant
.
The
chips
-
so
good
,
so
delicious
.
Yes
,
seems
so
silly
to
rate
the
free
chips
,
but
again
another
sign
that
this
restaurant
cares
about
how
food
tastes
and
only
serves
the
best
of
ingredients
and
food
.
As
mentioned
above
,
the
abundance
of
fresh
ingredients
,
especially
fresh
vegetables
,
in
all
dishes
.
As
for
the
other
entrees
,
I
've
never
been
disappointed
.
Take
your
pick
-
they
're
all
good
.
This
restaurant
has
actually
moved
,
and
is
no
longer
located
on
University
Ave.
They
are
now
on
Allen
Bvld
.
I
think
they
have
settled
in
to
their
new
place
,
and
service
is
back
on
par
.
Bon
Appetit!Sooo
...
Ok
.
I
live
Mexican
food
.
I
grew
up
in
Southern
California
so
my
standards
for
Mexican
food
are
high
.
That
being
said
I
assume
most
places
are
gon
na
be
bad
so
that
if
they
are
good
I
'm
quite
happy
...
And
if
they
are
n't
well
...
That
's
what
I
expected
.
This
place
made
me
happy
and
quite
upset
at
the
same
time
.
I
'll
start
at
the
beginning
.
The
chips
...
Kinda
bad
.
They
were
super
dry
and
weird
.
Super
weird
consistency
and
zero
salt
.
Our
second
basket
was
better
,
but
still
lacking
.
The
salsa
was
ok
...
Not
amazing
but
not
bad
.
Margaritas
were
good
and
seemed
to
be
on
the
strong
side
which
no
one
should
complain
about
...
ever
.
My
burrito
was
actually
alright
.
I
had
the
carnitas
burrito
and
it
was
good
.
It
needed
a
bit
of
spicing
up
so
it
asked
for
hot
sauce
and
another
margarita
when
the
waiter
checked
back
.
He
said
no
problem
.
A
few
min
pass
and
he
brings
my
margarita
and
says
he
'll
be
right
bam
with
the
hot
sauce
.
Ok
...
I
'm
eating
very
slowly
because
I
want
that
hot
sauce
.
It
's
now
been
probably
10
min
since
my
margarita
came
.
I
do
n't
like
eating
slow
...
And
I
finally
say
screw
it
and
finish
eating
.
He
comes
and
takes
my
plate
away
...
And
then
he
brings
me
the
hot
sauce
to
the
table
.
I
mean
really
?
